She helped her father with the work in the garden.
He's a baseball player.
I don't need you to remind me of anything. I know what I'm supposed to do.
That has nothing to do with this problem.
Tom doesn't want us to do that.
"If you do that, you're going to subject yourself to ridicule."
Just because something is possible doesn't make it a good idea.

The telephone is ringing.
He lost a book.

The method Tom suggested might've been better.
Did Tom contact you?
I want to change my life.
How about a walk on the beach?
I'm smarter than you.
What's the matter?
Tom hadn't eaten anything the whole day and was hungry.
Tom went straight to the post office.
"Which do you like better, ice cream or cake?"
You have done very well.

He's scared of dogs.
I've come for Tom.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
Tom worked.
Take this medicine between meals.

A quarterly growth of 1.2% means an annual growth rate of 4.8%.
He didn't shed a tear.
I'm not good at this sort of thing.
I don't know who to choose.
Is there anyone who can answer?
I trust you all.
Are you through with the newspaper?
You're unreliable.

I've missed out on so much.
I don't have any money.
What's the title of the book you're reading?
Tom could tell that it would be impossible to reach a compromise with Mary.

Don't play games.
Does anyone know where I could find one?
"Tom, what do you think?"
I bought him a drink in return for his help.
"How could you do this to us, Tom?"
Real men drink tea.
I noticed that she sat in the front row.

Are you watching your weight?
What made you think about that?

It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
Has anything like this ever happened to you before?
It's unlikely that Tom will get out of prison anytime soon.
That is essential.

He's going to love this.
Peel the potatoes and carrots.
I expect everything will go according to plan.

I hugged Tom.
Tom will probably never walk again.
Tom will have an answer for you by next week.

Tom was anxious.
He gives an apple to the teacher every day.
It's only when I can't sleep at night that the ticking of the clock bothers me.

I go to Hyogo University.
Did you solve the problem?
He can be counted on.
Tom forgave Mary breaking her promise.
Hold this.
"After work, I go right home."
There must be something else to drink.
The sun has not risen yet.
"I'm not drunk, but I've been drinking."
Have you lost your mind?
Do I owe you something?
Tom and Mary couldn't talk to each other then because they didn't speak a common language.
Tom doesn't want to admit that Mary was right and that he was wrong.
This happened before.
"You're a good boy, Tom."
We all have a lot to learn.
We rose from our seats when the national anthem was played.
It is pitch dark.
Tom visited us this past weekend.
Please turn off the gas.
I'm thinking about you.
There's only one explanation.
I'm always busy.
Rules apply to everyone.
What did you say that for?

She wasn't polite to him.
She's been poisoned.
He told his brother the story.

I'm glad you're all here.
Tom said we should start early.
Tom doesn't have to come.

That's not what I asked you.
Do you have something stronger to drink?
We can't stay here.
Tom never killed anybody.
We should save some cake for Tom.
I've heard of you.

How adventurous!
Mary loves going out with her girlfriends.
Let's take a break.
I'm pretty sure the first thing you'll want to do when you get to Boston is call home.
Why do you think we're here?
I like the sun.
Are you saying Tom isn't happy?
Tom is Mary's husband's best friend.
I don't belong to any club.
I seem to have misplaced my keys.
Don't say a word.
I felt the floor shake.
It serves you right.
Tom and Mary were my backup singers back when I used to perform.
I'm not going skating today.

They were plainly dressed.
I don't care what it is.
He's going to cross the river.
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow.
He and I are classmates.

Thank you in advance for your help.
You seem to know everything about this.
Don't leave the bedroom window open.

Stay away from my daughter!
It seems like there's no money left.
Start running.
He's crying.
Did you use to live here?
Try to be generous and forgive.
Tom's snoring kept me awake all night.
She'll lend you a book.
I was lying.
I have a gift for you.
The pan is too hot.
"I know that, Tom."
It doesn't get much better than that.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
Has that been scientifically proven?
This problem is too difficult for me to explain.
Tom looks weary.
Tom has learned a valuable lesson.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
Tom lived in Boston for a few years.
Tom isn't going to like that.
"Excuse me, but do you mind if ask your name?"
Nobody wants you to do this.
"We don't know where Tom is, but we need to find him as soon as we can."
Let's get back to business.
All your problems have been solved.
Tom wanted to start a new life.
I heard you did well.
I am at school now and I will stay here until 8 o'clock.
I have been looking for you.

Anyone home?
I'll be home by midnight at the latest.
Tom came to sit with me on the sofa.
I apologized for having been late for school.
Prices have gone down.
Give me the keys.
He did not seem sure of his answers.
The hole is big enough.
I want to know the reason.
Tom milked the cow.
"Humans are healed, but machines are repaired."
Which cup is yours?
"Which is easier to read, this book or that one?"
It's important that you tell me the truth.
Who do you love?
American English isn't better than British English.
Who took part in the contest?
I'll follow you wherever you go.
"Sorry, the book is out of stock."
I shouldn't have done that.
Tom cut the cake in half.
This is a road map.
I've always preferred working alone.
There is no need for you to stay here.

Tom was listening with his eyes half closed.
Prices depend on supply and demand.
Tom had nothing more to add.
We've got to leave early.
I should do that right away.
Please wait for me at the station.
A stocky man with a swarthy complexion snatched Mary's handbag and disappeared into the crowd.
"Why are you doing that, Tom?"
The baby is sleeping in the cradle.
Why's Tom like that?
We both have the same problem.

Allow yourself to make mistakes.
"Are you going, too?"
Your father is tall.
I thought I could do it without anybody's help.
Do you want this or don't you?
How would you feel in this situation if you were Tom?
Tom put some salt on his eggs.
"What did you do? ""I didn't do anything."""
What's your favorite word?

Here's the answer to your question.
You don't look like Tom.
"You drink too much, Tom."
It didn't hurt at all.
Tom got a tattoo.
"If anyone can do it, it's you."
I'll do anything you say.
He often laughs at his own jokes.
Tom went down to the lobby to meet Mary.
He was too tired to walk any further.
Tom said he's going to do that.
The post office is half a mile away.
What have we done?
Which CD do you want to listen to?
I can't carry this suitcase by myself.

Tom and Mary went outside together to feed the animals.
She was dressed in black.
I think he will never come back.
"It sounds simple, I know."
Everyone is waiting for Tom to say something.

Someone must have taken my umbrella by mistake.
You should finish the work.
What are you trying to prove?
"Tom walked a few steps, and then collapsed."
Take care!
I put it in the drawer.
Tom told me he had no time to read books.
The crew found a stowaway.
Shame on you.

The reason doesn't matter.
Football was played in China in the second century.
My sister insisted on going with me.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
I met her in a coffee shop near the station.
Can you draw me a map of your street?
She looked excited.
Tom has no idea how to deal with this problem.
He came back last August.
I'd like to be called Tom.
I can neither confirm or deny that rumor.
I no longer need to work.
What's that got to do with Tom?
Tom collects old coins.
They live near the school.
We are going to meet him tonight.
Is this dog Tom's?
What are you crying for?
I didn't lie to you.
Give me a break here.

It's crawling with spiders.
Tom isn't going to stop doing that.
Tom looked at it more closely.
You don't need to come in.
"Tom sets the table on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Mary sets the table on the other days."
Tom might possibly know the answer.
I'm trying to talk to you.
Everything she does shows that she has character.
Are you looking for me?
A crowd gathered at the scene.
He walked away with a sad look on his face.
What are you doing in Boston?
You're not my type.
You've done a good job here.
They know who he is.
We're scared it'll happen again.
We killed time by playing cards.

They loved you.
You are wearing your socks inside out.
Save me a donut.
She looked sadly at me.
The skirt didn't fit so I had to alter it.
I want you to promise me something.
Tom got stuck in the mud.
She is dearly loved by everybody.
I'm not inspired anymore.
São Paulo is the richest state in South America.

It's been three years since I've been to Boston.
Tom did his best to protect Mary.
I went skating on the lake.
Tom said Mary was very tired.
Tom and Mary were seated across from each other.
Tom understood exactly what Mary wanted him to do.
Humans are the only animals that wear clothes.
Tom did nothing but watch TV all day.

This is by far the tallest building in this city.
Is this your first time to eat Japanese food?
Let me do that for you.

It has to stop.
You did that on purpose.

I think it's impossible for Tom.
Be quiet during the lesson.
We captured the thief.
"Tom will do that, I'm pretty sure."
You have to take off your shoes before you can come in.
Tom is certain to come on time.
Do you have any pets?

Where are they living?
That'll complicate matters more.
I want to show you something in my office.
The girl had no one to turn to for advice.
Tom aced the test.
I think it would be better if I went alone.
It's irrelevant.

I once saw a man walk barefoot over hot coals.
I'm at my parents'.

We've been looking for you.
Tom wishes he didn't have to help with the housework.

"Mary resembles her mother in looks, but not in personality."
Whatever we find in here is mine.
Are you famous?

He has a heart of gold.
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday.
You should call Tom.
I took the cake out of the oven.
Tom is kidding.
I think that Tom lied to me.
How can you tell if someone likes you?
We'll find that out soon enough.
Try not to make the same mistake twice.
I'm game.
Do you have a pen on you?
Do you have it?
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
That shop sells newspapers and magazines.
The cart was in the shed.

I'm so glad that you asked me to give the opening speech tonight.
He teaches English to his friends.
"What are you doing here, Tom? Mary doesn't want to see you."
Tom has been asking to see you.
My mother wants me to study in Switzerland.
It was a very fortunate meeting.
What should I say?
The muddy road has ruined my new shoes.
Doing it this way is more efficient.
Can't you help us?
He graduated from college last year.
We know him.
Do you know what you need to bring?
Do you have something to write with?
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom was not aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
The paper was beginning to peel off the walls.
She had the box carried downstairs.
He has a lot of teaching experience.
Get out of my way.
Mary put a note in Tom's lunchbox to tell him how much she loves him.
Tom can run faster than me.
I'm still not used to the way things work here.
Tom is kind of tall.
Tom pretended not to know the answer.
"Tom doesn't want me to go, but I'm going to go anyway."

He was in good health last summer.
You slept through most of the movie.
He died as he was returning to England.
Have you met him already?
What's Tom got?

He uses honey instead of sugar.
His car is a Ford.
"The Hilton Hotel, please."
Tom wrote this report by himself.
That's particularly alarming.

Do you think I'm joking?
Why are you pretending you don't remember?
I think I could learn a lot from you.
I took a taxi to get there in time.
I smiled.
Don't forget your bag.
This book is easy to read.
Tom made us do it.

"According to the weather forecast, a storm's coming."
I must get it fixed.
An Englishman would not use such a word.
Did you live here?
There were a lot of people there.
You may still do it if you want to.
I object to her going there alone.
Refreshments will be served afterwards.
This kind of experience is familiar to everyone.
I'll have to call you back.
We need a plan.
Is it true that you climbed this mountain?
I cannot thank you enough for your assistance.
Tom looks happy today.
I can't get over it.
I'm of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher.
You must be starving.
"It's one thing to make plans, but quite another to carry them out."
It's extremely cold today.
We've upset Tom.
How long will you stay in Japan?
We can't confirm that Canadians were involved.
Make this sentence a little shorter.
Why do I always have to do that?
It can't get much simpler than this.
I won't let you speak to me that way.
I don't know why Tom doesn't want to go sailing with us next week.
The future will come soon enough.
Tom had nothing.
Tom doesn't seem to be aware of all the problems he's causing.
Would you like some more tea?
Please take this parcel to the post office.
Do you actually feel sorry for Tom?
No one can separate them.
We'll meet at the usual place.
Hackers are adept at getting around computer security measures.

You should go in there.
There’s no proof of that.

"As is often the case, he eats while reading a newspaper."
Tom still hates Mary.
The girl was sobbing in the corner of the schoolroom.
I am sure Lizzy will be very happy.
Please don't scream at me.
Tom applied for a passport.
You were totally right.
She is no longer what she used to be.
This room is a mess.
Here's my email address.
How can Tom not understand that?
Do you know where my recipe book is?
This kind of thing happens.
"It came to a grand total of 150,000 euros."
I'm a big fan of golf.
But how does this story end?

Will he come this evening?
I have a big problem.
I am a masochist.
Tom and Mary have an understanding.
Tom saw Mary across the room and went over to talk to her.
I didn't eat all the fries because they were too oily.
"Excuse me, could you please take a photo of my friends and me?"
Tom is in the prime of his life.
Tom said that wasn't the case.
I'm afraid I can't make a nine o'clock appointment.
They went away.
I have been studying French four years now.
I wonder why they chose Tom.
He quickly adjusted to the new situation.
Tom cooked rice for everyone.
My parents were satisfied with my grades this year.
When was it built?
Tom was tired after working all day.

I cannot find time to read the book.
Yours was better.
You mean a lot to me.
Tom is quite young.
Tom is above average height.
Tom doesn't need to get up so early tomorrow.
It is still light outside.
We have a test tomorrow.
How much money have you got?
I have done everything I could do.
That's all I saw.
Is Tom mad at us?
Did you give Tom my phone number?
Can I pick the next song?
You have to make Tom believe you.
Tom has a friend whose father is an astronaut.
Tom and Mary plan to go hiking tomorrow if the weather improves.
My parents sent me to fat camp when I was thirteen.
You're welcome to wait here.
I'm meeting Tom for dinner. Do want to come?
I'm now married.
Get on with it.
I'll check your vision.
Don't worry. You'll make it.
More is needed.
Tom won't be here until later.
She became happy.
Why do you lie?
You should have your eyes examined.
There are seven continents on the earth.
Soon I have to go get a haircut.
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
"What time, exactly, did Tom leave?"
Are you absolutely certain about this?
Tom asked Mary to get some glasses from the kitchen.
Your house is three times as large as mine.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
He kept his word.
The French like to eat snails.
He knows how to find water in the desert.
What do you suggest that we do now?
I could tell by the look on his face that he had come on very important business.
I've already said I don't know how to do it.
Do you know what you're doing?
I don't need your money. What I need is your time.
Tom played the piano for three hours without taking a break.
They did what had to be done.
A guard's been killed.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
You shouldn't act selfishly.
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
My neighbor renovated his house completely.
I am blinking my eyes.
I'm supposed to go to Boston on Monday.
His life is in danger.

Tom sang a duet with Mary.
I am Japanese.
The fog began to lift.
It's too late to turn back now.
Why are you giving it to me?
"Let's forget the whole thing, OK?"
Tom thinks he knows where Mary lives.
Is it really necessary to buy all this stuff?
Is there a bank near the station?
She prefers quiet music.
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
I can't make out the meaning of this sentence.
Tom said that he wasn't planning on doing that.
We must respect the rights of the individual.
Please don't ask.
His arguments don't convince me.
Please come back at once.
Tom isn't cut out for this type of work.
We want you here.
"Since he doesn't feel well today, he can't come to the office."
"He and his wife tried to work out their problems, but couldn't."
Is Tom OK?
Is it raining now?
He slept soundly.
I like watching people.
"Computers are certainly playing an important role in our life, whether we like it or not."
What is the name of that bird?
I think we should repaint this room.
What kind of movie is it? Is it popular?
You must certainly be very hungry now.
I like the black shoes.
Do you know anybody who can teach my kids French?
That's our responsibility.
The rain came down in torrents.
A fire broke out during that night.
I can't count the number of times Tom has complained about that.
I am not accustomed to speaking in public.
I can't believe that a guy like Tom was married to a woman as beautiful as Mary.
Do you really want me to be frank?
Tom's uncomfortable with close personal relationships.
I need something to open this crate with.
Pay close attention to what I'm telling you.
Tom eventually pleaded guilty.
You can't skateboard here.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
He did a great job.
All this is for my personal use.
He is not too poor to buy a bicycle.
Would you like to play with Tom?
I thought you said you weren't interested.
I went on with my reading.
I haven't spoken with Tom since he got married.
I don't care if you believe me.

Are you afraid of silence?
Where are we?
I stayed home all day instead of going to work.

Tom is used to getting up early in the morning.
It hasn't been that long.
I really want to know what's happening here.
You owe Tom three hundred dollars.
Did you remember to wear warm socks?
Tom can drive now.
My sister works in a bank as a secretary.
Are you going with us?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be in love.
Who did you give the book to?
The doctor may have said so.
"Tom said, ""You can kiss your girlfriend goodbye if you don't kiss her goodbye,"" which meant, ""If you don't kiss your girlfriend goodbye, then you'll never see her again."""
Only time will tell.
The next few years won't be easy for us.
You had better have your eyes examined.
Tom went fly fishing with his father.
I forgave Tom.
"Shut the door, please."
"As for me, I have no objection."
Can you help me when I move?
Tom didn't want to stand in line.
"Tom is going to be there, too."
My association with him did not last long.
I didn't know that Tom was so lonely.
I can't find him anywhere.
Each player did his best.
Will you help me look for my purse?
I never said no.
Let's shake hands and be friends.
The boy is jumping.
We went to the movies.
The government issued the following statement.
Tom is reluctant to leave.
Have you ever given money to a beggar?

Tom said something to Mary in French.
I could have sworn something moved.

We'll eat lunch together at 12:30.
Tom goes to bed at the same time every evening.
I punched him in the face.
Tom is always daydreaming.
Tom said he was too busy to help Mary do that.
Tom understands what needs to be done.
Is your room clean?
He's a big coward.
He may have missed the train.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
I think I'm going to stay here.
Are you a perfectionist?
Baking a cake takes more time than frying an egg.
Tom has some explaining to do.
I know his name.
There are 43 prefectures in Japan.
I'm going to bed.
My opinion doesn't really matter.
Is that why you're upset?
I have to brush my hat.
Tom has feelings for Mary as well.
"Every student of biology, anatomy, anthropology, ethnology or psychology is familiar with these facts."
The only way to know if it fits is to try it on.
How many friends do you have?
I don't know what to say to Tom.
Cook for me.
I'm in love with you.
There's no one here by that name.
He jumped to his feet the moment he heard the news.
Tom is still alive.
He wanted it to be a surprise.
The school gate is closed.
I'm replaceable.
What happened to your car?
Tom saw something.
That's what you have to do.
I never heard him sing.
I calculated that it would cost 300 dollars.
A doctor quickly cut off his left arm and stopped the heavy bleeding.
I listened.
Can you call for help?
It's starting now.
She is very anxious about your health.
I should've talked to Tom first.
I knew Tom didn't do that.
I thought Tom knew Mary.
Mary pretended to polish her nails.
Please knock before you come in.
I found it.
I'm in charge here.
I've always gotten along very well with Tom.
Gas prices have dropped.
Can you speak more than three languages?
Let me know if you need my help.
I can't make head nor tail of it.
"I waited for hours, but she didn't show up."
I just work here.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle.
He was wounded in the shoulder.
Tom explained how the accident happened.
You're the only one who asks those kinds of questions.
You must know yourself.
Who succeeded?
I am Chinese.
This is by far the best way.
I suppose you want to eat now.
Tom seems like a happy child.
"I'm sorry, Tom. I can't do it."
Why didn't you guys tell me?
You never answered the question.
I'll stand by you through thick and thin.
Tom knows I'm here.
I'd be delighted.
How did you get into the house?
Did I miss something?
I want to learn how to use my new digital camera right away.
Tom is cute.
I'd like your opinion on this.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
She is a singer.
I'll find out who he is.
I can't locate the source of the problem.
We provided them with money and clothes.
Twelve is an even number.
Are you currently using any medication?
Mary is wearing a silver ring.
A man of wealth has to pay a lot of income tax.
We talked about various things.
Don't do that again.

What I have to tell you is very important.
Tom is one of my students.
Why are you reading that book?
They sell textbooks at the bookstore.
What were Tom and Mary doing here?
I should never go shopping without you.
"I know some of you want to go back to the way things were, but that's not going to happen."
Tom leaned back and smiled.
Do you want to play tennis with us?
I don't like the house he is living in.
You can go if you want to.
His story can't be true.
Tom heard a gunshot.
It's hard to imagine a life without pets.
Does Tom disagree?
He is unmarried and has no brothers or sisters.
I didn't order it.
I graduated from the University of Kyoto.
I asked my boss for a pay raise.
Why does Tom think that?
Did you notify Tom?
Tom is playing with his cat.
She kept her eyes closed.
You should take care of yourself.
I should've chosen the money.
You're so skinny.
They have lost a lot.
They never give up.
Have you finished talking?
She became very ill.
Maybe you should just fire Tom.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another engagement.
Why do we need weapons?
My big brother finished his homework very quickly.
That was magic.
Tom is ready to go out.
You can't let Tom win.
Many people use cash machines to withdraw money.
"I like Tom, too."
"The cop went through his pockets, but found nothing."
I don't have a phone.
Are you listening to him?
Your family should come before your career.
I'll talk to you later.
Tom crossed Mary's name off the list.
Tom has a mahogany desk.
I could kiss you.
Tom knows things.
Maybe I should rephrase that.
I think the worst is over now.
Why does everything happen to me?
Boston is one of my favorite cities.
Stay here with us.
Tom accidentally set fire to the curtain.
Tom didn't have time.
What floor do you live on?
How late is it?
Mary iced the cake.
I am interested in this book.
Where were you?
Tom has forgotten his umbrella again.
My fate is in your hands.
You are really very good.
I think I'm crazy.
I'm more afraid of them than I am of you.
Tom entered through the back door.
Nothing is more important than friendship.
The meeting will start at four o'clock sharp.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Tom becomes bored easily.
She called him a liar.
Do you know what's in that box?
Where's your car?
How long did it take you to translate this book?
It was a huge success.
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
Tom was the one who wrote this story.
"You think I'm making a mistake, don't you?"
We often hear about an energy crisis these days.
You don't look well.
How bad is Tom hurt?
That'll make Tom very happy.
Your method is better.
Now I want to go and do it.
Why do you want to take a taxi?
Release Tom.
Tom is uninsured.
What do you have hidden behind your back?
Is it getting worse?
"I want to get married, just not to you."
Is everybody happy?
Tom is pretty sure that he can't become pregnant.
You leave me no choice.
I was too astonished to speak.
It's time to do something.
He crossed his legs.
Who has it?
Tom says what he thinks.
I think we'd better leave Tom alone.
"Every time she coughed, she felt a great deal of pain."
What is the exchange rate?
Do you know how Tom is doing?
How could I help you?
We were able to catch the last train.
The teacher mixed up our names.
You're so mysterious.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this now.
I hate reptiles.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
This pond isn't deep enough to swim in.
I have several good friends.
How can I extract the audio from a video clip?
I like China.
I'll make sure Tom does what we asked him to do.
Tom is neutral.
It is stupid of you to believe in him.
It was a long time ago.
Someone wants to meet you.
I have bad breath.
Organic food is healthier.
I spent yesterday reading instead of going out.
Did you enjoy yourself at the theater?
"Give me a second, please."
Tom and Mary wanted to have children.
You can use the hotel's swimming pool.
Tom said that he thought the statue weighed about 300 pounds.
Tom ordered some food.
Why do you think that?
Why don't you wait till morning?
Are you coming to pick me up tomorrow morning?
We rented a canoe.
Did you receive my package?
They call him Tom.
"She advised him to take a long holiday, so he immediately quit work and took a trip around the world."
This story doesn't have a happy ending.
You can't judge a person if you don't know him well.
"Landmines kill 15,000 to 20,000 people every year, many of them children."
Tom accidentally shot himself in the foot.
Tom stood quietly.
Do you know what this means for us?
The river is no longer as clean as it used to be.
"What's going on with you, Tom?"
"Hey, look what I'm going to do."
Will the ice bear our weight?
I wasn't sure if you'd come or not.
He took off his hat and made a polite bow.
My watch says 2:30.
I asked Tom to be here 45 minutes ago.
I wonder what it feels like to be rich.
Please hurry! Tom is waiting.
Tom isn't drinking green tea.
My name isn't Tom. It's John.
Please remind me to turn in the paper.
Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't like dogs.
"There being nothing else to do, we went for a drive."
Tom noticed that Mary was sitting in the corner by herself.
This paper has a large circulation.
When is the next guided tour?
I slapped him.
Did Tom have a plan?
"If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go, too."
They stopped quarreling when I came in.
Tell Tom I want to see him.
I need an envelope.
Wait in the car.
Tom and Mary frequently complained that they never had time to spend together without the children.
Everything's negotiable.
They invaded the country.
Which car is your father's?
Did you watch the movie?
He was the first man that climbed Mount Everest.
I don't have any other choice.
He is happy.
I just got my hair done.
I'm married to Tom.
I know you like me.
The publishers of that newspaper are very liberal.
I can't see what the hurry is.
I just want your love.
I thought I'd left it at home.
I'd like to know what you talked about.
It's Tom who's the traitor.
I prefer coffee.
Nobody argued against choosing him as chairman.
Nobody cares about that.
Tom has a heart of stone.
This drawer's stuck.
I did that until I was exhausted.
Tom promised to be here by 2:30.
Aomori is famous for its good apples.
Tom became weak.
I need to be in Boston by 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
Tom is usually busier than I am.
Tom knows how to bargain.
It's like magic.
Why isn't Tom doing that?
The economic situation grew worse.
It's a quarter to three.
They're in the car.
How did you come by such a job?
I envy your good health.
Everybody is alive.
Seals eat fish.
Help Tom.
"If you speak French, I won't understand."
I wonder if Tom still likes Mary.
There was no toilet paper.
A curtain of mist blocked our view.
Tom can't imagine living without Mary by his side.
Tom suffered a severe head injury.
I find my job fulfilling.
My driver's license expires at the end of this month.
Are you celebrating Christmas?
Don't go up there.
"If we don't leave soon, we won't get there while it's still light."
Tom says he's thinking about getting married.
We can't offer you any money.
I hope you get well soon.
Many promises had been made.
I've given up smoking.
The bridge collapsed when one of the cables snapped.
Tom lay face down on the blanket.
She reconciled with her friend.
The police will put you behind bars for twenty years.
Both of them are busy.
His face brightened.
I have a son not much older than you.
That's the snag.
Could you please overlook it this time?
Every ship needs an anchor.
My hands are shaking.
They just left.
Most experts think a lot of his theory.
I sang at church.
Light the candles.
Tom told John that he would ask Mary to the dance only if John asked Alice.

I want to be a journalist.
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
Tom sailed across the ocean in five days.
Tom is filling out a job application form.
Did Tom send you?
When did he fall ill?
The neighbor asked us to turn the music down.
It is generally hard to adapt to living in a foreign culture.
That's the woman who wants to see you.
I only wish I had a little more time to finish this.
Do you have a wife?
Tom wouldn't leave me alone.
"I've tried calling him all day, but the line is busy."
Men are better at this than women.
Tom doesn't like to speak French.
Tom needs two tickets to Boston.
We have plenty of time.
You seem preoccupied.
It was raining that day.
It is probable that she will come.
Roll down your window.
"You heard what Tom said, didn't you?"
The climate here does not agree with me.
He tried to concentrate on the letter.
These kinds of problems are unavoidable.
Tom may testify.
I suspect Tom and Mary are planning on being there.
I was just talking about you.
Tom can hardly wait to meet you.
The Golden Gate Bridge is made of iron.
I wrote my name on the paper.
I might be able to answer that question.

It seemed unbelievable.
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
"I'm so embarrassed, I want to die."
Tom was staring at a photograph.
I met him yesterday.
Don't lie to me.
I know you are hiding yourself behind the curtain.
Do you think that will change anything?

I made coffee.
I'm willing to accept your offer.
Are you dreading this as much as I am?
Tom is frightened.
Do you think we'll return before dark?

We sure don't want that.
This is something to consider.
I already told you that a hundred times.
All Tom ate was bananas.
She's been sick since last Wednesday.

It's a waste of time to study when you're sleepy.
Do you want to hear the truth?
Do you want to know why Tom isn't here today?
My parents don't like my girlfriend. They think that she's not good enough for me.

We'll leave at eight o’clock.
He did the unthinkable.
You've got the wrong number.

Now you're safe.
Do you have any money left?
Thanks for doing that.
I just told Tom that I wanted to help him clean the garage.
This is the perfect hiding place.

Please feed the dog every day.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you bring rolls?
The house fell down a week later.
I didn't want to lose Tom.
It's not like you have anything better to do.
Be nice to her.
There seems to be a mistake.
It doesn't seem very fair.
I have a new email address.
Running so fast is impossible for me.
Notice how the player uses his elbows.
Tom used to be ugly.
Tom doesn't allow his son to eat ice cream.
Tom plans to go on a vacation next week.
Is there anyone we invited who hasn't come yet?
He speaks English and French.
I can't let you leave.
It's been a long time since I visited my grandmother.
I went to the park yesterday.
Are they tall?
The children are playing with blocks.
I don't want to sign that.
He has a car that has four doors.
It is foggy.
Green suits you.
I have a lot more homework than Tom does.
I should've stayed.
"That wasn't so hard to admit, was it?"
Tom has a bad cold.
Have you ever eaten chocolate-covered popcorn?
Whether the news is true or false makes little difference.
The official start is on Saturday.
I'm happy to see you.
Are you sure we're allowed to do that?
We need Tom.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
Those are Tom's.
We're not going to give up.
Let me explain.
"Tom thought he'd broken a bone in his foot, but an X-ray showed that he hadn't."
Do you know what I want?
I don't know what happened to him.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
Tom always does that for me.
The animals were busy collecting nuts.
A gentleman is someone who knows how to play the banjo and doesn't.
I'm not interested in any of your theories.
My father goes to work by bike.
I've been looking for a girl like you.
My little brother always sleeps with his teddy bear.
Why does Tom think I'm here?
Tom is in pretty good shape for his age.
Feel free to contact me.
Tom signed the contract.
Thank you so much for helping me.
The person standing near the gate is Tom.
I'm a bit short of money now.
When do you usually go to bed?
Do you have an extra key?
He thought that it was like a bird cage.
Tom gave Mary the money.
I acted without thinking.
"When I grow up, I'm going to get married to Tom."
A fish can swim.
I don't believe him at all.
I get up early.
That's exactly what we did.
It's all up to you.
I bought that scarf we looked at yesterday.
It is a very sad tale.
How could you do this to us?
What is the letter about?
Please call me at this number.
Let's catch a quick bite.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
Do you really expect me to give you money?
He plays the violin very well.
"Tom considered leaving school, but decided against it."
Take a bus.
You have a good memory.
You may be right about that.
It's junk. Throw it away.
That picture brought back a lot of memories.
Tom shouldn't have borrowed Mary's car.
Tom believed that John was his brother.
Existing legislation does not take diversity of races into account.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Why don't you have a look?
Did Tom tell you why he wasn't at school yesterday?
I feel like going on a trip.
We're here.
You're just a boy.
Tom doesn't know where to look.
We must feel our way carefully in the dark.
Would you please tell me the way?
Did Tom work for you?
Are you taking your meds?
You shouldn't expect things to be easy.
I just can't help.
Tom gets up at six every morning.
What kind of music do you like to listen to when you're driving?
Tom wouldn't cry.
No one ever doubted that Tom would win.
We might not need to pay the full price.
Let me ask Tom if he wants to go with us.
Are you still living in Boston?
No one's judging you.
Our rent is four times as much as it was ten years ago.
I want to sing the song.
"To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what happened."
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
Tom is a conservative.
The reasons Tom gave for doing that weren't very good.
"I'd like an 80-yen stamp, please."
I don't quite believe it when I hear someone claim they can speak more than five languages fluently.
You can't put a price on a life.
This never would've happened if you'd done it the way I told you to do it.
I hope that you'll help me.
That'll do.
I'd like to see what Tom has.
Never tell a lie!
Tom waited more than an hour.
Why is this allowed?
Write me.
These books are ours.
I used to go to school with him.
I couldn't help it.
Tom wants to come.
"They survived, even though the building was destroyed."
Tom wanted to do everything himself.
May I use the phone?
I saw her last week.
I have done a good job.
Tell me what I need to know.
I would rather stay at home than go to the movies tonight.
Father gives Mother all his salary.
What're they up to?
What will you use it for?
I am glad to help you.
Minutes passed like days.
Tom hid under the table.
Tom's doing OK.
Birds of a feather flock together.
I'll be able to see you next year.
Rules are made to be broken.
How about this one?
What would you do if war were to break out?
You look nervous.
Tom was killed in an ambush.
"Listen to me, Tom."
That's what we're looking for.
How's your shoulder?
Please call me up later.
I thought you might know where Tom went.
"Tom is nervous, too."
I'd love to go there one day.
I'd like to see some proof.
He's always at home on Sundays.
I go to the movies once a month.
What's this smell?
I have to go to the police station.
Is your gun loaded?
Have you finished your work?
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
Can I speak with Tom?
I like how you think.
I'd like to know how Tom got a hold of our private documents.
The police officer tried to deescalate the situation.
You can keep it if you want.
Tom was promoted to foreman.
What I told you about him also holds good for his brother.
We now live in Boston.
Everyone in town knows his name.
Tom is the only man that Mary has ever loved.
"That's what I love about you, Tom."
Tom got shot.
Don't set foot in that neighborhood.
She didn't go far.
Are these your things?
It's not important anymore.
I won't rest until I find out the truth.
I hate driving.
Is Boston very far away?
Italy is a very beautiful country.
"Tom tried to speak, but he couldn't."
Tom is the CEO of a billion dollar company.
Tom is too busy now to talk to you.
What do you want anyway?
It's my job.
He sang a song.
It is cheaper than chemical fertilizers.
I'm not thirsty at the moment.
Mother-in-law jokes are funny because they're true.
The streets are clean.
I thought I'd lost you forever.
Tom promised me that he'd do that before he went home.
"We have something special for you, sir."
"Tom, I'm here."
How do we do it?
I love your son.
He likes cantaloupe.
Did you get a massage?
Look at it again.
The garden is in front of the house.
I get bored quickly in everything I do.
Mary is baking a cake.
"Tom, will you stop that?"
I'll leave it to you to buy the tickets.
It's awfully cold this evening.
Tom wanted to know what happened.
Tom was in a bad mood.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
You're in great danger.
How are we going to repair this?
She likes music very much.
I'm hitting the road.
Tom now wears a wig.
I thought I saw someone I knew.
I like to watch TV in my Jacuzzi.
We'll get it.
It doesn't matter where he comes from.
Tell Tom I'm looking forward to meeting him.
Could you please get the jar of peanut butter from the top shelf for me?
"You have no idea what happened, do you?"
I planted an apple tree in my garden.
Tom opened the door a few inches.
The man blushed.
I want to ask a favor of you.
Tom motioned for me to leave.
We will check to see if what you have said is really the truth.
I lost my purse on my way to school.
I had to give up my plan.
My father encouraged me to study the piano.
I thought it would make him laugh.
I don't know when Tom will leave Japan.
Tom let out a sigh of relief.
Tom dyed his hair black.
Tom became a little flustered.
Return fire.
When did you last see my brother?
Tom is at least a foot taller than Mary.
He knows how to use this weapon.
He likes soccer.
Why quit now?
Why do we need to learn this?
"You know her name, don't you?"
He is influential.
Tom wanted revenge.
Tom was taken prisoner.
What time does the play start?
Where do we have to do that?
A sleeping child looks like an angel.
I've forgotten Tom completely.
Can we talk about what happened that day?
I don't know his whereabouts.
Have you eaten lunch yet?
I'd like to be woken up tomorrow at 6:30.
I wish I could turn back time.
You must've hated Tom for what he did.
I suddenly realized that my watch was gone.
Tom wears a different tie every day.
I bought a lot of books.
My arm still hurts.
These windows aren't clean.
There are many people that don't like me.
Her death was a great shock to me.
Tom's gotten fatter since the last time I saw him.
Tom is manipulating you.
Tom wants to get rich quick.
Did you actually watch the show?
Be happy for me.
I've got to get used to doing this sooner or later.
Tom is an enormously gifted musician.
Tom had company.
I'm glad Tom left.
There are only books on the shelf.
His son has what it takes to be a good doctor.
How many milligrams are you taking right now?
"If you want to change your mind, I'd understand."
What you said is true.
I heard you were sick.
The family fortune has increased a great deal.
The girl has no mother.
This child believes that the earth is flat.
You could hear a pin drop in the room.
I thought you said Tom would never hurt Mary.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
Tom is the person to ask.
We have been studying English for three years.
"This is a secret just between you and me, so don't let it slip out."
When did you find out about it?
I am to go to Paris.
I waited for him all day long.
Don't make me stay.
What do I owe you?
It's virtually impossible.
I visited Tom in Boston three years ago.
I'm aware that every choice I make has a consequence.
Tom was alone on Valentine's Day.
Tom showed me an interesting video.
I met her by chance in the library.
"If you hadn't interfered, we wouldn't have had any problems."
Reality is scary.
Can I turn off the TV?
We've known each other for a long time.
Faith can move mountains.
I like him because he is honest.
Something has to be done.
Our sphere of influence has expanded so much since then.
"The little girl, deeply moved by the old man's pitiful story, burst into tears."
Everyone hesitated.
It's just started raining.
The prize will go to the best student.
Tom was up until about 3:00 a.m. reading a book.
Don't worry about it. Everything's going to be fine.
We have been here for two days.
They've taken Tom.
The money is on the table.
Does Tom have any family?
Please don't accuse me of something I didn't do.
I want revenge.
I'll call Tom and tell him we won't be coming.
I couldn't get another copy of the book.
I hope you caught more fish than I did.
"This is my book, not yours."
It goes without saying that honesty is the key to success.
All-purpose flour can be used in a variety of recipes.
I resigned from my position as club treasurer.
He has never hurt anyone.
Many people love horses.
I asked Tom where Mary was.
He was fired for stealing.
I did not play tennis yesterday.
I'm not an expert either.
He should thank you.
The color is purple rather than pink.
Mary is Tom's daughter-in-law.
He was robbed of his youth.
It came apart.
Tom wants to talk to you.
Tell her to not look for me.
Take mine.
Tom couldn't rest.
The skaters skated around the rink.
Tom is a native speaker of French.
Tom didn't even say goodbye.
Tom said that he was happy that you didn't do that.
Please charge this to my account.
What's going on?
"When Tom went to the mailbox he found five letters, four of which were bills."
Tom has trouble remembering names.
How does that strike you?
What's the spelling of your family name?
Tom says you want to go to Boston with us.
We're at home.
"To err is human, to forgive divine."
The one who has everything can lose everything.
When will you leave?
Tom wants to learn how to play the guitar.
I need some mental stimulation.
I often run into her at the supermarket.
I'll stay at home tomorrow.
Tom is a terrorist.
Did you have to wait long?
Tom slipped back into unconsciousness.
His birthday is May 5th.
Could you help me?
"At this rate, we'll have to change the schedule."
We must finish everything before Tuesday morning.
Tom had a hard time learning how to ride a bicycle.
I am not interested in politics at all.
Would you excuse me?
Tom doesn't feel like cooking.
Tom loves money.
Tom is standing nearby.
He has a black shirt.
I've already answered this question.
How did you find us?
Tom broke his promise and didn't help Mary.
Tom is waiting for the bus.
Do you like to live in the country?
Let's begin our work at once.
Tom thinks he knows what to do.
I'm not from a rich family.
"We have you to thank for that, Tom."
This is the only possible time for doing that.
I think she will divorce him.
You never call me.
He devoted his whole life to science.
He is two years older than you.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
What do you want to see while you're here?
May I talk to you?
I don't like you anymore.
Do not turn off your computer.
Tom has known Mary since he was a little boy.
I can't hear it.
Her husband's success hasn't affected her attitude toward old friends.
I was expecting you last night.
This is our decision.
That's not enough.
I can't believe no one died.
All the stories are interesting.
Do you know Mr. Jackson's first name?
You sure seem happy tonight.
Is this your phone?
I owe everything to you.
You haven't heard the half of it yet.
My daughter went to school.
"It's been nice talking to you, but I really must go now."
What are you two doing here?
Tom was in the middle of nowhere.
What's that thing you have in your hand?
You need a ride?
Maybe Tom would be willing to help.
Are you in favor of the proposal?
Why was Tom transferred?
Tom talked to Mary as well.
Who's not busy?
Do you have any more questions?
Tom already did that.
He is incompetent.
He's in a good mood today.
Stay in your room.
He didn't speak to me for several days.
We know you have it.
I don't want to argue about this in front of everybody.
Don't tell your dad.
You look Japanese.
The little boy has lost the money given to him by his father.
They have enough money for their bills.
It is of little value.
I'd appreciate your help.
Tom started to put his tools away.
Nobody noticed that she was absent until the end of the meeting.
I can't stand all this noise.
I couldn't make myself understood well in English.
Tom arrived home to find that Mary had packed her things and left.
She is friendly to everybody.
She is blackmailing him.
Tom is grown up now.
You can't leave me here alone with Tom.
Do you want to take one?
Tom came even though it was raining.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
He is a work horse.
I'm used to cooking for myself.
Do you believe in life after death?
That's not what Tom is asking.
I've discussed this situation with Tom.
Why isn't Tom coming?
I know you're here.
Count from one to a hundred.
Would you please tell me your full name and address?
Take care of your own affairs yourself.
A few people have two cars.
The clock struck midnight.
We happened to be in Hokkaido then.
"Whatever you do, don't do that."
Tom and Mary want to come over.
It's been three years since Tom left Boston.
The child was crying for her mother.
What did you promise to do?
Can you do this?
Tom doesn't know Mary's telephone number.
Put your hand up when I call your name.
We do love it.
I don't want to go jogging with you.
He picked up the book.
Tom said goodbye to Mary.
She rented a four-room apartment.
Tom said I was the only one who said thank you.
I was there last night.
It took him three tries.
Tom writes everything down.
Where are your credit cards?
Tom recognized Mary as soon as he saw her.
It is difficult to give up smoking.
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom?
Tom was cautious.
Tom parties too much.
I was scolded by my mother for being lazy.
That's understandable.
Let's go to the gym and shoot some hoops.
I can see why you don't like Tom.
Tom showed Mary around the school.
Did you see him go out?
Remember that we have a meeting on October 20th at 2:30.
I put all my belongings in a plastic bag.
It's probably just the wind.
I told Tom not to come.
Please be patient with me today.
I have nothing in common with him.
That's a really big apple.
Please send my mail to me in care of my father's office in Tokyo.
He did his duty.
I carefully took down everything that my teacher said.
I do not love him any longer.
It was much more difficult than we initially thought.
My father went jogging after dinner.
You are a mean person.
I want to know why you don't like me.
What country were you born in?
I had bought it the week before.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
Tom never told Mary how much he loved her.
That hurts.
I had to decline his offer.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
The train arrived at Osaka station.
Have you finished reading that book?
The remark was aimed at you.
I've never been so tired.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
"Leave Tom alone, please."
You are not at all what I expected.
Cows spend hours just chewing their cud.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
The leaves have begun to change colors.
Tom is mad at me and I can't say I blame him.
I felt like singing loudly when the exam was over.
I spent the entire day on the beach.
This is the key that opened that door.
I was told that I should see a doctor.
I've made things worse.
What are you going to do this evening?
I'd better be going.
I'm not a young man anymore.
It will have been raining for a week if it does not stop tomorrow.
Tom is rich.
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I'm not doing this for the money.
Do you have any objections?
It is a pity you cannot come.
How did you do this?
The population of Japan is about 120 million.
"I'm not certain, but I think so."
Tom is in shock.
There are frequently earthquakes in Japan.
How did you get into Harvard?
Tom shouldn't have written that.
Something's obviously wrong here.
I have to get some food.
He promised not to say it.
Tom isn't going to see me.
Tom gave his cat to Mary.
Could you knock down the price if I buy two?
Tom jumped into the lake.
Your success depends on whether you pass the STEP examination or not.
How small a screw do you need?
Is that all Tom told you?
Please do something about it.
I've lost interest in golf.
You're motivated.
Don't tell anyone I'm here.
He's looking at you.
It takes you an hour to go to the station on foot.
Do you like San Francisco?
That remains to be seen.
Have you ever eaten Mexican food?
The king abused his power.
It doesn't belong to you.
I don't care about your past.
Tom hasn't slept at all since the day before yesterday.
You can't just come here without an appointment.
I'm interested in music.
The rules aren't important.
They married when they were young.
These kittens are so cute and cuddly.
I've never met anybody like you.
My parents expect me to enter the university.
That's a strange question.
I'm glad to hear that.
Perhaps I can answer that question.
"I want your opinion, too."
I wasn't born yesterday!
Tom actually did what he said he would do.
We should go.
"Tom didn't know how to translate the word ""computer"" because the people he was talking to had never seen one."
Do you have a motto?
I won't leave without you.
Tom took a swig from the flask.
Tom is popular at school.
I can't imagine it.
Is this the first time you've had this symptom?
How did Tom get Mary and John to stop fighting?
Tom assured me that this kind of problem wouldn't happen again.
You look very good in blue.
What an interesting theory!
The room is now ready for you.
My father will come home at seven.
I'm not a bit tired.
Tom may not like what he sees.
Did you have fun with Tom?
I don't want to hear it.
This mobile phone is really expensive.
The airport was closed because of the fog.
You're not fast enough.
They kissed each other.
"I am fond of soccer, rugby, football, and so on."
"I love you, too."
Tom said that he was fine.
"Tom said he thought it could happen in Boston, too."
The basements of the houses are likely to have problems.
"When I got there, there was no more cake left."
Has everyone gone crazy?
"These girls, who're my pupils, have come to see me."
He put some sugar and milk in his tea.
You are not permitted to touch the art.
It's seven o'clock.
I cared about Tom.
He chased the thief.
It was love at first sight.
This is too expensive.
Will you wait a moment?
She doesn't like soccer.
"She likes oranges, doesn't she?"
Tom is refusing to tell us what happened.
I cheered myself up by listening to music.
Tom is practically dead.
Give me half of it.
Tom brought plenty of food.
Are you still having trouble with that?
Where's Tom today?
Let me help.
I think they saw me.
Tom stayed here.
I got here as soon as I heard you needed me.
We spent our holiday at the seaside.
When did you come back from Germany?
I hear voices in my head.
He does not know how to solve the problem.
You should omit this word from the sentence.
Tom is against taking the new job.
I live here alone.
It seems like there are never enough hours in a day to get everything done.
Tom disappeared without a trace.
We do this every year.
Tom never wants to see Mary again.
Tom said it was your fault.
Ask Tom if he can do that.
I have a lot of problems to solve.
We can't take the risk.
How long have you been learning French?
I am happy to hear your voice.
He's the black sheep of the family.
"Excuse me, how much is this?"
Tom barely ate.
"German forces attacked British soldiers near Amiens, France."
Someone stole my rucksack.
Tom doesn't have the right to say that.
The boy observed the birds all day.
Try this on.
Tom sat down.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
I know you're talented.
I can't just pretend nothing happened.
I'm afraid I have some rather bad news.
Tom spent many years in prison.
Why does Tom want to do this?
Tom seemed very surprised when I told him about it.
I've never seen anything like it.
I excused myself for a minute.
Who would do such a terrible thing?
I misunderstood.
Tom was wrong about that.
You have no idea how much that means to me.
Cats don't like getting wet.
"At last, my turn came."
Tom looked in the yellow pages to find a used car dealer.
You must tell us.
I wish to live in a big city.
The suit's custom-made.
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
Driving during a storm can be dangerous.
He talks fast.
The rainy season has set in.
All of my siblings are taller than me.
When do you intend to start?
You obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
A little bird told me.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
A lot of kids wear jeans.
Is that what I think it is?
Does anyone know Tom's family name?
The axle is broken.
This bottle holds one liter.
I asked Tom the same question.
Tom read it for me.
He says he met my father.
Should I wait for her to come back?
Your room is twice the size of mine.
It is good to be a winner.
I'll go to Tokyo by train.
Flowers attract bees.
Are you working today?
This diamond ring is too extravagant for me.
The plane arrived exactly at nine.
He earns more money than he can spend.
I hear the drum.
I can't give you any more details at this time.
You should not go alone.
Tom just wants to have fun.
You should have refused such an unfair proposal.
I have failed.
The taxi has arrived.
Tom and Mary seem to be in love with each other.
Tom never finishes anything.
Do you have a school uniform?
She mistook my brother for me.
It's close by.
She can't bear the noise.
It snowed in Osaka.
I want to continue this discussion tomorrow.
It's not clear when he came here.
Washington's army has captured Trenton.
His job is to negotiate with foreign buyers.
I wonder what Tom thinks of me.
I ate a fly by mistake.
Do we know each other?
Be careful what you do.
You should go.
Tom is conscious.
Tom usually eats lunch alone.
"During the summer, I will go to France."
The tumor was benign.
There wasn't even one book in the room.
This is all still new to me.
The roof is covered with sheet metal.
Tom found Mary lying unconscious on the kitchen floor.
Tom doesn't know what he's saying.
The key is on the table.
Why can't you come?
Tom has no sense of style.
We can count on Tom.
Roosters can crow but it's the hens who lay the eggs.
The bridge is under construction.
Who are you afraid of?
He can speak 10 languages.
They got into the train.
He wants to sell his old car to a man in Kobe.
Tom just got home from work.
Tom is average.
That's how I got to know her.
I hear he traveled by bicycle from Hokkaido to Kyushu.
Has Tom returned?
Did you forget to feed the dog?
The answer is no.
I won't tell you Tom's phone number no matter how much you try and pry it out of me.
What's in the box?
Help Tom out.
I'd rather not sing that song.
That computer has a quad-core processor.
"You don't want to pay more than you have to, right?"
Is it really true?
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
This is the latest fashion.
The price of this car is very high.
Where did he learn this?
Let's give Tom another round of applause.
"He said to himself, ""Will this operation result in success?"""
Do you go to church?
Tom doesn't have to know about it.
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom what happened.
Look at this large map of America.
Eggs can be used as weapons.
Could you turn it down?
I'm not going to sing that song.
I don't need a reason.
This is crazy.
A person like Tom has probably never kissed anyone other than his mother.
Tom resigned this week.
I hope that you'll help me.
You're making me nervous.
Tom is a good chess player.
Tom opened the beer.
Tom won't lose.
That's not true at all.
I love Christmas songs.
I can bake bread.
Tom said he's thirsty.
Tom doesn't have a brother.
How late am I?
"Tom is a lawyer and a very good one, too."
You've got to believe me.
What's Tom want?
I can speak French.
There are heavy fines for parking in a disabled zone without a permit.
Many of the world's greatest discoveries happened by pure chance.

Isn't that what Tom said to Mary?
I love you.
Tom closed the shop early tonight.
It took only one day for us to do that.
Would you help Tom find his keys?
Tom has three cats.
They were very shocked.
I think you'd better lie low until she forgives you.
I was very moved by her kindness.
I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
We're still here.
Why is everyone scared of Tom?
I will show you the picture.
Not much has changed since then.
Do you prefer reading to cards?
He was born in Nagasaki.
Do you like studying?

This is my job.
It may snow.

I reported the theft of my car to the police.
"This is a cargo ship, not a passenger ship."
I can't stand to think about it.
You're like Tom.
It's entirely up to you.
He lives far away from his hometown.
We're lucky that the weather is so nice.
It might be a while until Tom gets here.
I prefer to study in the morning.
We got the job done on time.
There were almost no cars in the parking lot.
Is this true?
Stop being cruel.
I'm never going to love you.
What are we looking for?
Tom was the first person who has ever offered to help me.
That's the same story as I heard when I was a child.
May I go first?
She is usually at home on Sundays.

He's stupid and irrational.
There was another problem.
Why didn't you try the dress on before you bought it?
I have to go talk to Tom.
It's more trouble than it's worth.
"Tom is good at French, but he's a lot better at English."
Why do you want to do this?
Do you want to sit down for a few minutes?
He was visibly bothered.
That doesn't happen.
You could be a little nicer to your brother.
I don't like the idea that money is everything.
I will go there even if it rains.
Things are very different today.
Slip on your shoes.
I think you know Tom.
Tom probably wants to eat some Chinese food.
Just be yourself.
Father often helps me with my homework.
She died when she was 54 years old.
Phase one is complete.
The man aimed a gun at the policeman.
My dog always barks at the mailman.
Would you mind my using this dictionary?
I'm leaving Boston.
You need to eat breakfast.
"I like outdoor sports, such as baseball, tennis and soccer."
He has a firm belief.
It's too late now.
The news soon spread all over the village.
Do you want to see her very much?
I should've done that yesterday.
Are you going to break in?
Tom ran to catch the train.
How do I get to the airport?
Will you please put the baby to bed?
In what kind of situations would you do that?
Please get off the couch.
Are you going in?
I've never felt this way before.
The car battery is dead.
I knew you'd come after me.
I haven't dismissed you yet.
He's on his last legs.
Tom kept a list of all the food he'd eaten that week.
Let's review Lesson 5.
That sounds like the kind of thing he'd do.
How much are they offering?
The children were sliding on the ice.
What's the name of the ship you served on?
Tom chuckled.
Everything was fine at first.
You don't look sick.
Keep in mind what I tell you.
You're the tallest one.
We can't help you now.
They took a vote on the motion.
"You don't understand, do you?"
Aren't you going to thank me?
He has made a promise to come again.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
Don't forget to mail this letter first thing in the morning.
Tom looks after us.
I'm always careful.
Just act as if nothing has happened.
He speaks as if he were rich.
He is my brother.
My first car didn't have power steering.
I told Tom that I wasn't busy.
It went just as we expected.
The recession caused many businesses to close.
"Come here, Tom."
The beach is an ideal place for children to play.
You can't handle the truth.
Tom and I have some catching up to do.
Tom was shot by a police officer.
What did you think it was?
Tom speaks French better than I do.
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
You look familiar.
It doesn't matter anyway.
Did Tom like Boston?
Don't go out of your way.
Isn't that curious?
They can't say you didn't warn Tom.
I feel like I've known Tom forever.
I was at a loss for words.
Tom sat on the arm of the couch.
Are you through with your breakfast?
How often do you see him?
Has Tom spoken to you about me?
I'm not sure why I'm here.
He hung a picture on the wall.
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this.
Cherry blossoms are very beautiful.
Can you tell me where I am on this map?
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
The enemy kept up their attack all day.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom went into the room first.
I'm a beginner in Esperanto.
I thought it would be a good idea.
Tom and Mary love each other.
We know where your family lives.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go with him.
I need a new car.
He's wearing a hat.
Did you really do that?
I'm so mad I want to scream and break everything!
It's getting hot in here.
Tom will probably be right.
It's a quarter to two.
You stay put.
Barack Obama is the President of the United States.
We're not home.
Tom is well paid.
I'll be able to finish in a day or two.
I had read only a few pages before I fell asleep.
It was not so simple to write a letter in English.
Please write down my address.
I know it's hot.
Do you want me to fix your broken shovel or don't you?
How long did you stay in Boston?
"Right now, Tom just wants to be left alone."
Our leader will know what to do.
I don't think children should drink beer.
I had nothing to say.
I'm pretty good at cooking spaghetti.
Were you expecting someone?
I'll be able to help you.
Tom complained to Mary about the food.
He has a large number of books on his bookshelf.
Tom has known Mary for close to ten years.
Don't be so angry.
Was there someone else in the room?
Tom was the only boy in the entire class.
What do you want to do with your life?
Did you bring your family with you?
I think you went too far.
I'm very worried about your health.
He does nothing but read books all day long.
I guess you are right.
His wish was to go to America.
Is it true that Tom can't swim?
Tom is a misfit.
How often are letters delivered here?
Almost everyone was late.
How long will you stay with your aunt?
You've been suspended.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Tom can't do it all on his own.
Tom deposited some money in the bank.
Your timing is perfect.
That is what I have wanted to buy.
It is essentially a question of time.
I came to tell you that you don't need to worry.
I will not help you.
I got the house number wrong.
Tom isn't with us.
What you did was very brave.
Why are people afraid of you?
It's the best thing that ever happened to me.
The roses in my garden are beautiful.
"He may be rich, but he is stingy."
I don't have the time to read this book.
You can't just quit.
Why did you do that?
Don't you have a pen?
Tom just got back from Boston this morning.
This place still looks the same as it did a long time ago.
You have my full support.
I am afraid I can't help you.
Stop hanging out with losers.
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
You should have knocked before you came in.
Where does this car come from?
Tom was a farmer.
Tom threw the anchor overboard.
Tom will be so proud.
They must be happy.
What are we doing today?
We have fish for dinner today.
"In those days, I made it a point to take a walk before breakfast."
I thought I was alone.
He has run out of energy.
I know what I think.
Tom wrote his name on every dirty car windshield in the parking lot.
Politics leaves him cold.
Tom doesn't need to do anything he doesn't want to.
All three of you need to do that.
He isn't afraid of death.
There's so much I want to say to you.
The teacher is with the school principal.
A pencil is sticking out of your pocket.
She always walks to school.
It took a long time to accustom myself to the noise.
Who are you talking with?
"Tom drives a sports car, doesn't he?"
Tom pulled out an old shoebox from his closet and opened it.
He believes that he can prove it.
You knew I knew.
You cannot have your way in everything.
The mail is delivered once a day.
He became furious.
I thought Tom had red hair.
It doesn't make much sense.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary treats her dog.
You're not a suspect.
No kidding?
You are what you eat.
Tom was frank.
Do whatever you like.
The baby appeared to be sleeping quietly.
I think we made a wrong turn somewhere.
How about going out to eat tonight?
Give me back my wallet.
To my dismay I found I had lost my money.
The boy began to cry.
Tom knows a lot of stuff about Mary.
This area is rich in marine products.
There is a better way.
The cashier bagged the customer's groceries.
Let us go.
Tom left at midnight.
Tom opened the door and let the dog out.
"If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me."
We saw her enter the room.
I'll drive you there.
Our town has excellent sports facilities.
I'll make you happy no matter what happens.
He has his reasons for staying there.
I'll follow Tom.
"You're Tom's friend, aren't you?"
Does Tom have one?
Who wouldn't love to find one of these under the tree on Christmas morning?
She was born last year.
Why don't you and Tom do it?
Tom used to be a special education teacher.
I'm Tom's bodyguard.
Has he come?
He suddenly fell ill.
I will be back at half past six.
Repeat each sentence after me.
Turn up the TV.
He was a fresh face in American politics.
Tom gets a kick out of this kind of thing.
We went to Korea by plane.
Stop right here.
Do you want a cookie?
I will follow you wherever you go.
She poured boiling water into the cup.
The smell of roses filled the room.
Who taught her how to speak English?
Do you have to go?
It's not rocket science.
"Even standing right in front of the stove, Tom still felt cold."
I don't want you to quit what you're doing.
My truck is parked over there.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Tom had trouble finding this place.
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that.
Tom says you're a genius.
Does he know how you feel?
It's a fish.
Tom is always breaking things.
He will be talking with his family at this time tomorrow.
"If you want something to be done right, sometimes you've just got to do it yourself."
Would you like me to show you how to do that?
The woman downed the gin and lime that was served in one swallow.
"When he was a kid, Tom liked to hide in the closet."
Tom knows all about Mary.
I wanted to help Tom build his house.
I have to learn how to shoot.
There used to be a coffee shop near the school.
Open your mouth.
It's highly unlikely that Tom will drink any beer.
"If you like, I'll tell you about what happened to Tom."
I don't remember you asking me to do that.
Will you look after my dog while I'm out?
I'll live with the consequences.
What's mine is yours.
Don't you think I deserve an apology?
Tom didn't know who Mary's father was.
The kitchen is downstairs.
I studied hard to enter the school.
We talked until two.
Is it possible that it's already eight o'clock?
Tom asked Mary if he could read her mother's letter.
This is your only chance.
I don't think we should go this way.
Tom eats rice at least once a day.

Can I talk to you?
The work must be finished before noon.
The weather in Florida is generally moderate.
It's a proven fact.
A captain controls his ship and its crew.
"Sometimes I say ""yes,"" even though I want to say ""no."""
"We're here, too."
I don't have the strength to keep trying.
Don't be a cheapskate.
Tom and Mary were high school sweethearts.
Tom finished second-to-last.
I forget his name.
I'll do my best.
Do you know the difference between a microscope and a telescope?
Where are the other girls?
I focused the camera on her face.
Please close the door.
You've got to stay awake.
Tom admires your courage.
I'm not going to ask you again.
She is bathing the baby.
Tom seems happy.
Tom has tonsillitis.
They left one after another.
Tom is not in prison at the moment.
You're doing everything wrong.
What kind of books do you like to read?
I want you to reconsider your decision.
Why did you move out?
You can trust them.
We have to figure out a way to make Tom do what we want him to do.

Whether or not Tom gets the job in Boston is still very much up in the air.
Do you know where my recipe book is?
We don't like you.
Tom's strategy worked.
Why are you torturing me?
She pressed her lips firmly together.
Do you understand what I want to say?
You have to decide that for yourself.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
My house is like yours.
I only wear a kimono about once a year.
You are seriously ill.

We don't want Tom to do that anymore.
Everyone but Tom listened carefully.
The train is traveling at the rate of 50 miles an hour.
Tom didn't stand.
Tom didn't feel much like smiling.
Tom is sound asleep.
I know this place is haunted.
We wanted dessert.
How fast can you run?
Who's the guy over there?
How many times do I have to say no?
I can open the window.
"You were very hungry, weren't you?"
My grandmother raised me.
She gave birth to a healthy baby.

I've finished watering the flowers.
I'll look into that.
I want to know why you did that.
We need it badly.
Do you shave every day?
I'll do that for sure.
I don't think that's what's causing the problem.
I wasn't asleep.
You have a nice family.
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
Can I leave my luggage here?
I was wrong about that.
I wanted to talk to you anyway.
She talks to him as if he were a child.
She's my daughter.
I have a message for you from her.
I don't read comic books anymore.
Mary wore a white miniskirt.
Tell me everything Tom said to you.

I think Tom may do that.
We're pretty pleased with that.
This semester I failed two students for plagiarism.
Tom never makes his bed.
I parked my car by the gate.
There's no one there.
Tom likes sitting on the beach in the early morning.
We can't satisfy everyone.
I don't think anybody can help me anymore.
I haven't heard from Tom all week.
"She likes jazz, and so do I."
I thank you with all my heart.

The game will be held rain or shine.
Don't make faces.
The cause of the fire is not known.
The question is whether he'll read the letter or not.
Let's leave as soon as Tom gets here.
Where's Tom from?
I'm not going to do it.
Tom isn't responding.
That was a more serious problem than we thought it would be.
I don't want you to think about it anymore.
I didn't do anything illegal.
"Hurry up, and you will be in time for school."
It's not enough.
Do you have one that's cheaper?

It's just not enough.

Tom is passionate about his work.
Tom says that he wants to go to Boston.
"His name was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't remember it."

How is your wife doing?

I don't know if that's what Tom wants or not.
Beat the eggs with a whisk.
Tom got Mary drunk.
Have a safe journey.
I found this book in a secondhand bookstore.
Next year will be worse.

She was pale with fear.
The press confirmed the rumors.
"She advised him to visit Boston, because she thought it was the most beautiful city in the world."
Tom took the day off.
Do you know her?
Watch out! This monkey is vicious.

Do you want to take that?
I have a few things I want to make clear.
You should learn French.
I'd like to drink something hot.
Have you tried that store?
They've fired him.
Is Tom in trouble?
Tom wouldn't blame you.
I wish you were here.
Where are you planning to spend the night?
"Tom wanted to ask Mary to go out with him, but he didn't have the courage to."
I cannot do without this book.
"Whatever happens, don't panic."
We need to know everything that you know about the situation.
He is getting old.
The rumor can't be true.
That's what Tom likes to do.
I saw Tom play tennis.

He earns his living by teaching English.
It was a perfect fit.
Where is my dad?

I'm not angry at you.
The bottle smashed to pieces.

I just saw a shooting star.
I guess this is goodbye.
I overheard your conversation.
I knew this would happen.
It's very unlikely that Tom wrote this report.
The contract was signed.
"When you travel overseas, you usually need a passport."
"English is not easy, but it is interesting."
I am married and have two children.
The problem perplexed him.
Am I under arrest?
I put on my shoes.
I can't remember where I first met Tom.
"Tom seldom, if ever, does that anymore."
I know what it is.
Compasses point north.
They gave up.
How did you know that Tom didn't like Mary?
This is a great theory.
"Don't go, Tom."
Take a book and read it.
How do I get over the river?
Tom walked into his apartment and closed the door behind him.

You should see a doctor.
Is my explanation clear?
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
The fruit went bad.
Do you have any soft drinks?
This stinks.

Let's hurry it up.
Tom suddenly appeared.
Tom realized something was wrong.
He is always giving people a lot of trouble.
He devoured his meal.
"Give it up, Tom."
Tom spends lots of money on clothes.
"If you want quality, pay for it."
She goes to night school.
Tom doesn't like cheese.
I know what I need to do.
I found a way out.

You have a pretty garden.
I'm sure I saw her two years ago.
"Having met the girl before, I recognized her at once."
He is a tough cookie.
Tom did a handstand.
I've got a feeling Tom might be right.
He arrived very early this morning.
Tom is a total nutcase.
She dumped him.
The matter is really pressing.
Tom has no sisters.
Tom just sat there saying nothing.
Tom has nothing.
You look sad. What's wrong?
I want proof.

Tom carefully raised the lid.
"Are you going, too?"
How fast was Tom driving?
Write me.
Tom asked me if I was hungry.

I'm very sad.
Please wait a moment and don't hang up.
She is muttering to herself.
Tom is embarrassed by what he did.

Every day I either ride a bike or get the bus to work.

Tom hardly talks at all.
He has poor eyesight.
Sometimes I can't really grasp the meaning of a word.

The rich have many friends.
Did Tom have a gun?
It is necessary for you to study harder.
"You don't really know, do you?"

It is obvious that that is a lie.
We have to think about it.
Teachers must understand children.
Tom says he goes jogging at least three times a week.

He helped me carry the baggage.
They've had plenty of time.
What else do you have in your pocket?

I'd rather not continue this conversation.
I'm pretty sure that Tom now lives in Boston.
Tom always talks fast.
Do you have Japanese newspapers?
I am not kidding.
"I think it will cost you more than 10,000 yen to have this camera fixed."
What's going on with you and Tom?
Do you mind if I sleep here tonight?
The wedding is going to be quite an event.
Maybe I'll fall asleep.
We have a very good chef.
I have faith in you.
Tom insists on coming with me.
Love doesn't exist.
I told you it wouldn't work.
The sun comes up in the east and goes down in the west.
I have what I want.
That book you lent me was really interesting.
The heat was responsible for the meat going bad.
You'll need a temporary bridge.
"It's very quiet here, isn't it?"
Tom won't change his mind.

I'm going to study English this afternoon.
He neither wrote nor telephoned.
I want to see you in my office right now.
You are the most important person in my life.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
My dream is to travel in a space shuttle.
He has a very interesting book.
People from all around the world attended to his funeral.
Are you trying to scare me?
I wish you didn't hang out with Tom. I don't like him.
Do you have a vacancy?
It's difficult to find one's way around in a strange city.
There's no reason for concern.
Does anyone in your family speak French?
She was absent from class.
This is the most fun I've had in a long time.
Show it to Tom.
They looked around.
That's Tom's father.
Tom didn't seem to know what he was doing.
There's milk in the fridge.
Is that black bag yours?
Do you know what it is?
He is watching TV now.
"This is your hat, isn't it?"
Do you have any proof?
He has green eyes.
What an absurd idea!
I don't need a flu shot.
Tom had no right to treat Mary like he did.
Tom is getting better at French every day.
You'd better let me do that.
Tom couldn't find his left shoe.
Not much soccer is played there.
Do you remember the first time we went to Boston together?
I'd like to have a spoon.
He inherited the business from his father.
"I was going to write to you, but I forgot."
Tom and three of his friends went camping last weekend.
We are doing business with many countries.
I have never been to America.
Tom doesn't like to wait.
Tom sounds mad.
That's why we want you.
"Right now, we've got bigger problems."
There's still hope.
Tom and Mary have been married three years.
That's why Tom is still there.
I've found something I'd like to show you.
"State your name and social security number, please."
Tom and Mary are obviously in love with each other.
Do you think this is too big?
It can not be true.
I'll let Tom know you called.
Is there anything you want to tell us?
You can make your own.
Tom showed Mary John's picture.
The cats are purring.
Whose cell phone is this?
It wasn't until this morning that Tom told me that.
Now I recognize you.
Tom hardly ever complains.
Tom's intentions were unclear.
Why would I fire you?
I value your candor.
How long does it take to the train station by taxi?
We missed the exit.
You can't imagine how tired I am.
Why would anyone want to kill Tom?
Have you received an invitation from Tom?
Let's pick flowers from the garden.
I'm not sure if it's a compliment or an insult.
"On Sundays, the museum is not open."
Can you really predict the future?
Tom knows what Mary said.
Tom turned to Mary for advice.
What do you think I should wear on my date tomorrow?
"Which book is older, this one or that one?"
It's possible that they'll go to the supermarket today.
I'd like to know why you didn't finish your homework on time.
Tom doesn't have much time to waste.
How do you access the Internet?
I can't live without you.
It isn't hard to do.
I have to find a way to earn a lot of money.
Tom liked to write stories.
Why would someone do that?
Do you want fries with that?
Would you like a cup of tea now?
I have lost the key.
I am no longer tired.
Where did they learn this?
This is the reason I came here.
You must not yield to temptation.
Do ghosts really exist?
I can't write with this dull pencil.
Let's forget it for now.
We've forgotten something.
He'll be along in ten minutes.
Tom and Mary are taking a break from work.
What's wrong with your dog?
I'm happy that Tom is happy.
There's nothing going on between Tom and Mary.
This does not apply to students.
Tom lit a match.
Thank you so much for coming by.
Tom and Mary were sitting next to each other on the couch.
The cat crouched down ready to jump.
"At first, I thought I was sick."
I'm very broad-minded.
"By seven o'clock in the evening, the streets are deserted in this town."
He tried to pull a fast one on me.
Tom now understands what has happened.
The man denied having stolen the car.
Let's see if I can convince Tom to do the job.
They'll attend the national conference in Las Vegas.
I can wait four days at the longest.
I've been told that I should pay more attention.
There's a white building just around the corner.
I tried to tell you.
I know you can do this.
Have you finished reading the book I lent you last week?
Why aren't you laughing?
Tom wasn't able to do what he wanted to do.
Stop flirting with me.
Tom kissed Mary on the front porch.
They're free.
I'll take any job you can offer me.
This just has to be Tom's hat.
I hope it was worth it.
I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
What are you into these days?
What can I do for you?
I saw Tom tonight.
I'm the one who should apologize.
"You don't like Tom very much, do you?"
Our parents took care of us and now it's our turn to take care of them.
"It doesn't make much sense to me, but Tom has decided not to go to college."
I am a tourist.
You need a key to open the box.
The theory is not accepted yet.
I hate winter.
Do you want to see where Tom is buried?
I have nothing to declare.
The paper didn't carry the story.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
I have something to show you.
I'm capable of making my own decisions.
I can't tell if Tom is dead or just unconscious.
You've got my keys.
Tom needs a transfusion.
Kyoto is not as large as Osaka.
I guess you don't really care.
I was in a coma for three years.
He is clever at making excuses.
She also likes chocolate.
The meeting took place yesterday.
Thanks for meeting me.
Break this glass in case of fire.
Let's find Tom.
You must have a driver's license before you can drive a car.
I almost wish I could be in your shoes.
What made you think Tom did that?
Please freeze the fish and meat.
I need a lot of them.
"Look, there's a rabbit!"
Tom said he wouldn't want to live in Boston.
That's a good thing to have.
They work at night.
It took all night to climb Mt Fuji.
Tom said that Mary was uncooperative.
He's the one who told me about that.
"If I had known her address, I would have written to her."
He loves taking trips.
Many people like to travel.
I want to eat something that I can only eat here.
"If Tom had asked Mary for advice first, he wouldn't have had this problem."
You're driving me nuts.
Tom doesn't go to the movies as often as he'd like to.
Tom doesn't know what kind of person Mary is.
Tom wrote that book.
He has no family to support.
Would you care for a piece of pie?
I was impressed with her work.
Tom is a truck driver.
I wish you didn't do that.
Tom met Mary outside.
He’s been asleep for ten hours now.
You have to move.
It was handcrafted.
"You're not very hungry, are you?"
The sun gives light and heat.
We're not family.
Read the note at the bottom of the page.
After lunch we have two more classes.
Tom was sitting alone in the dark waiting for Mary.
I knew it was a joke.
I think Tom needs your help.
Did you take the book back to the library?
"Run, Tom. Get out of here!"
Some things are best forgotten.
You can count on her.
She sent him a message.
This painting is attributed to Monet.
Tom is the best at what he does.
You may ask me any question you want.
Are you through with your homework?
Both spellings are correct.
"Close your eyes, and count to ten."
The chicken was wonderful.
You have to call Tom.
Will you accompany me?
"You live here, don't you?"

Where have you been all day?
Which language do you most often have conversations in?
I'm counting on you.
Tom is really smart and also kind of cute.
I do not have any money.
Tom rubbed his palms together.
You did not come to school yesterday.

It matters to me.
That made me very sad.
The situation won't change.

Does anyone know what this is?
It hurts here.

Tom told me it was none of my business.
I've decided to quit my job and take a trip around the world.

Have you ever had anything custom made?
Time goes by quickly when you're having fun.
Won't you stay for tea?
My house is very near the park.
We have no proof.
Please tell me your name.
I always do that.
I wish you didn't do that.
We're supposed to try to solve our problems by ourselves.
Why do people do things like that?
This English book is too difficult for me to read.
Our city is getting bigger and bigger.
Go and talk to Tom.
Hang on!

It'll make sense when you're older.
Today is Tom's birthday.
Tom is as tall as Mary.
Are you having a good time?
I suppose you already know that's my car.
Life is full of surprises.
I want to talk to him.
We've recently put a new roof on our house.
It did happen.
You're both insane.
Tom says I can't stay home alone.
I guess we could try doing that.
Tom forgot.
The dog seems sick.
Isn't that what they want?
I'm not interested in talking to her.
I have no more ideas.
My flight arrived at 2:30 p.m.
The story was so complicated that I couldn't follow it.
Do you know of any good restaurant near here?
What did she do to you?
Do you understand everything?
Don't enter the room without permission.
Tom always seems to be short of money.
I've never climbed Mt. Fuji.
I told her to sit down and drink a glass of water.
Your answer doesn't make sense.
I left a note under the door.
That's asking too much.
Tom has probably gone fishing again.
Tom was unmarried.
I was angry because he was late.
She is always curious about what I am doing.
I want to make you happy.

We'll start whenever you are ready.
It's 2:00 p.m.
Tom began singing.
She always says no.
It is hard for the couple to live together any longer.
She committed suicide by taking poison.
My plan was rejected.
"Tom asked Mary to stay, but she had to get back to work."
I need an envelope.
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
The estimate was a complete shock!
I'll be in my office all afternoon.
She is recognized to be an expert on linguistics.
The baby fell into the well.

Stop complaining.
Now do you see?
What a big truck!
I've never done it like that before.

These pictures are beautiful.
Don't ever mention his name again.
Littering in this facility is subject to a maximum fine of $500.
I think I'm right.
Tom can't go home until after 2:30.
Who asked you?
I'll take care of the rest.
Tom already owns more cars than he'll ever use.
I can't confirm that.
"If you buy a new car, what will you do with the old one?"
Tom chose not to respond.
I'll never make that mistake again.
I got it for free.
This car must have had tough usage.
He just texted me. I think he's drunk again.
Where is the library?
"In his opinion, the plan is far from perfect."
Tom lost his voice.
He gave me a bad cold.
I promise I'll be quiet.
She has dry hair.
You've lost too much blood.
Is it always cold like this?
That's all I have.
You can't talk to me like this.
Do you think Tom knows?
Tom gave flowers to Mary.
We'll wait.
This book belongs to the library.
They haven't paid me anything yet.
Close the window before going to bed.
Tom wore a dark sweater.
I wanted more.
I remember seeing her somewhere.
Where is the accent on the word 'Australia?'
He is what is called a self-made man.
Is that all you want?
You are in very serious trouble.
Tom and Mary want a big family.
See to it that this problem gets fixed by tomorrow.
"You aren't going to tell on me, are you?"
When did you return?
Please get the clothes in before it rains.

He put a cap on his head.
Her friend is a singer.
Could you please hurry?
"Since the accident, Tom has given up hope of becoming a professional dancer."
I don't hate you.
Why don't we talk about this now?
The debate over which consultant to use went on for hours.
They're talking about you.
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
Did Tom look busy?
Tom didn't want to talk about it.
Let's go see Tom.
Have you talked to Tom about this?
Can you see that small house?
Tom can't even finish a simple job without help.
Tom was never the same after that.
Tom hardly ever complains.
It is less muggy today than it was yesterday.
Ask me anything!
I didn't give them anything.
It's going to take about an hour.
I didn't want to scare you.
You can't really understand another person until you walk a mile in their shoes.

We're going ahead with this.
What do you need that for?
I am going in the same direction. Come with me. I will take you there.
Tom is certainly over thirty.
I'm looking forward to it.

Open the safe.
I'm only trying to help you.
That's uncalled for.
Were you expecting someone?
Tom listened to music in his room until late at night.
The children had the benefit of a good upbringing.
I want you here.
Did you hug anybody?
We're very worried about you.
I'd appreciate it if you could come.

Did I embarrass you?
Wait a sec.
My life would be completely empty without you.
Tom plugged in his computer.
I like Tom's plan better than Mary's plan.
Will you please tell us where Tom is?
I'd like to stay here.
You can borrow my car until you make enough money to buy your own car.
Nobody was helping us.

You've lied to me before. Why should I trust you now?
They were very excited.
The accident happened two hours ago.
You're part of this.
You'll be OK here.
You don't have to worry about me.

America is a country of immigrants.
We must prevent this type of incident from recurring.
That is the picture that he painted.

What's Tom's favorite food?
This curry is too hot to eat.
Please come again.

It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Japan has been sending athletes to the Olympics since 1912.
Did you already know that?
That girl is very attractive.
Tom was a big troublemaker in school.

How could you humiliate me like that?
We had a narrow escape.
Call them this evening.
Are they speaking French?
I'd like to speak with Tom in private for a moment.
Is the bar open yet?
Tom's mother was a devout Catholic.

Tom says hello.
Tom didn't want to sit next to me.
Tom is going out with Mary.
I hope you feel better tomorrow.
I don't feel much like talking.
He uses the same books as you use.
What're you doing with those?
Where is the newspaper?
"While in prison, Tom worked in the kitchen."
Take things as they are.
"Can you pay attention, please?"
Tom took one of the books off the shelf.
Keep working.
I can't remember anyone's name.
Take a bus.
Is there a golf course near here?
"A nice day, isn't it? Why not go out for a walk?"
It's within walking distance.
I can hardly see without my glasses.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
You don't waste time.
She complained to him about everything.
He gets a haircut once a month.
"Now that he has gone, we miss him very much."
"Tom is three years older than I am, but he's shorter than I am."
This is the diary which she kept.
I think we made it.
My pen is out of ink.
Do you have any cash?
Tom washes his hair three times a week.
Can I borrow those?

This book is hers.
May I take a look at it?
Don't take our word for it.
He has 12 sons.
He went to the hardware store to get a shovel.

We would die without air.
How old do you think she is?
The teacher called the students in alphabetical order.
Tom gave Mary a detailed explanation of how it worked.
Did Tom talk to you about Mary?
"Do you have this in black, too?"
My wife looked surprised.
I seem to have done something wrong.
I'll walk home.
They'll know what to do.
Look at that big hammer.
I want to thank you for helping me.
I'll show you the car I've just bought.
He pretended to be a stupid man.
We partied all night long.

Tom hasn't yet heard anything definite about whether he got into Harvard or not.
All you have to do is smile.

You have to ask Tom first.
You should have acted on her advice.
"Miracles do exist, but we just don't notice them in the flow of events."
We wear uniforms at our school.
Tom died of cancer.
"Written in technical terms, this book is very difficult to understand."
"Since it's very cold, we can skate."
Tom made no comment.
What's the subject of that play?
I can't stand those goody-goody types.
It is foggy.
Tom asked Mary to help him with his science project.
Let me ask you a simple question.
I met him by chance.
Friends are always willing to help each other.
Tallinn is the capital of Estonia.
Who knows the answers?
We'll survive.
Do you really think that Tom will be able to help Mary?
Tom couldn't get to sleep.
I don't know when he'll come.
She knows nothing about your family.
We found it here.
Tom suffers from dyslexia.
Please think it over and let me know your decision.
Are you sure about that?
Please tell us about your family.
Tom likes cats.
That girl loved climbing trees.
I would do that right now if I were you.
Make me happy.
We're not all like that.
It's no use.
I saw them.
It's all right.
We could go there now.
"In some countries, the punishment for treason can be life in prison."
History deals with the past.
Tom still has a slight limp.
Bad news travels fast.
I'm a little confused.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was creative.
Tom has only himself to blame.
"Since it's important, I'll attend to it."
I must've overlooked something.
We will leave in an hour.
Mother went shopping at the department store.
I have seldom seen such a beautiful sunset as this.
Usually I cycle or get the bus to work.
My mind was blank.
Mary is like a sister to me.
It was depressing.
I thought I'd be fine.
Please close the window.
I don't need reminding.
Tom picked up the glass of water and took a sip.
Why would I fire you?
Do you need help?
He wanted to flatter me.
Tom and I'll be OK.
It'll soon be Christmas.
You're both crazy.
Tom's plan worked brilliantly.
They have nothing against it.
Does Tom know this?
Did you mail the letter yesterday or today?
The news made my hair stand on end.
Tom doesn't have to go anywhere.
We know something about it.
Tell me who you are and where you come from.
One more person will be joining us later.
We were worried because we weren't getting any news.
Tom was unharmed.
What car did he take?
I wish I had a friend like you.
Can anyone tell me the time?
Give us a break.
Tom was in here the whole time.
The darkest hour is just before the dawn.
Tom is exuberant.
Tom left Mary in the room by herself.
Tom pulled the blinds down.
I knew he would accept.
We want to have a large family.
You and I are men.
Mary can't come. She has to take care of her daughter.
She is traveling around the world.
"She's stupid, but honest."
You should leave.
A pretty girl like you will definitely be noticed.
Tom told Mary that their relationship was over.
I don't like the idea much.
Tom managed to finish the work before 2:30.
I have something to talk over with you.
The children want to go to the pool.
Tom guessed how much Mary weighed.
We have more apples than we could eat in a day.
I arrived late last night.
Tom and Mary are moving next month.
Do you want to have sushi tonight?
I could kiss you.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
"You've put on weight, haven't you?"
How many years have you been married?
"In Canada, there are many areas where it is illegal to log trees."
The rain was beating hard against the windowpane.
"All men have some natural talent, but the question is whether they can use it or not."
She didn't show up at the party yesterday.
I know what it looks like.
I wish none of this had ever happened.
It would be better to try.
My clock needs to be fixed.
The man held on to his job stubbornly and would not retire.
Tom said he heard Mary threaten to kill John.
He was after the first prize.
Keep your eyes open.
Do you know how it feels to lose an old friend?
Tom has been busy all morning.
Be nice to her.
I spend money as soon as I get it.
Where is my beer?
Has Tom ever asked you to loan him money?
Just go back to the kitchen.
I play tennis an hour a day.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
The baby's awake.
I came yesterday.
Tom is watching you.
This smells like cheese.
He deserted his family and went abroad.
Please remain seated.
It serves you right.
"Even though I was wearing gloves, my fingers were cold."
I missed you very much yesterday.
I often go for a swim in the river.
I've done everything I was supposed to do.
Tom didn't give you much choice.
Tom went shopping with his girlfriend.
Tom set the table.
I couldn't sleep well last night.
There are sushi restaurants in almost every country in the world.
Is this man threatening you?
My daughter likes egg yolks.
Can you count to ten in Chinese?
Could you speak a little louder please?
We haven't even discussed it.
He armed himself with a pistol.
I had good reasons to do that.

Tom is pouring a glass of milk.
I have just been to the Midori Bank.
Take the road on the left.
I used to a lot.
There's no need to go to school today.
Tom suspected that Mary was lying to him.
They're coming here.
"We can't let that happen, can we?"
They're after me.
You look sharp.
Are all three of you bachelors?
Tom never arrived.
She wasn't helping her mother.
Tom is kind of strange.
You can't expect Tom to get well overnight.
She lives on vegetables and brown rice.
I think Tom will be interested.
Tom is pretty trustworthy.
Tom knows about that.
Why don't you like Tom?
"Quiet, please."
Tom called me today.
Tom has achieved his goals.
He lives off the grid.
I caught an awful cold.
They still haven't woken up.
I like canned fruits.
Tom was at home alone.
"English is hard, isn't it?"
"Oh, have a heart."
He congratulated me on my success.
Shall I prepare you a warm meal?
I like them.
I want to talk to you about last night.
This gift is for you.
I like singing in the rain.
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
"If the alarm rings, walk, don't run."
Tom won't let you go.
We divided the money between us.
Please take one.
Tom put an envelope on Mary's desk.
Why didn't you wake me?
Students discussed the problem of brain death for a long time.
Are you ready to start?
I heard our dog barking all night.
When did you finish writing the letter?
This used to belong to Tom.
He is a doctor.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
Tom has hiccups.
They could not prove their charges.
"Make way, please."
Down with the king!
Tom bookmarked his favorite website.
Tom's proposal is worth considering.
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
She loves to wear tight clothes.
Tom's best friend is Mary.
She is dieting.
I think he is planning something.
Tom has been looking for his dog all morning.
Do you know Tom's phone number?
The cat is hiding under the couch.
Do you miss me?
I don't tolerate incompetence.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
Could you gift wrap it?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Tom was pretty sure that Mary wouldn't catch a fish.
I had never done anything like that before.
How did you train your dog to come when you call him?
Opposites attract.
"I did say that, but I didn't mean it."
I'm not going to see you again.
"Do not use this product near a bathtub, sink, shower, swimming pool, or anywhere else where water or moisture are present."
You ought not to have spent so much money on your hobby.
That's really not funny.
We always help each other out.
Did you get stuck in traffic?
A little learning is a dangerous thing.
I was very busy this week.
They're with me.
It was dark and I couldn't see anything.
Mary wore a simple white dress.
She can't do without milk.
Many children had to look after themselves.
The ship made slow progress against the strong wind.
What do you think of the book?
I don't have any money.
Tom is around thirty years old.
Tom is not a liar.
Tom asked Mary many questions about life in Boston.
He bought a box of candy.
She kissed him on the cheek.
You shouldn't go out at night by yourself.
You'd better get going.
I asked Tom why he wasn't here yesterday.
We didn't get paid this week.
You're lucky Tom didn't hit you.
Tom was struck by lightning and died.
My father doesn't allow me to go to the movies alone.
Our school begins at eight-thirty.
See you tomorrow at the library.
I'm just kidding.
What are we doing out here?
You know better.
The city supplied the needy with blankets.
I don't believe that Tom is the murderer.
I can't resist a woman who knows what she wants.
We meet here once a month.
Each country has its own customs.
Butterflies are pretty.
I need to go back to Australia.
School starts at nine.
Tom was speaking to Mary.
I finished the work in less than an hour.
You're in great danger.
I presume that he has paid the money back.
"You think I did it, don't you?"
He climbed down from the tree.
Tom's dream is to live in a small town in the south of France.
It's better to walk back than to get lost.
Tom took care of that.
Tom signed the bill.
The cave was so dark that they had to feel their way.
Tom doesn't know how deep the pool is.
Exercise makes your body strong.
Quite a few people came to the party.
Your pants are unzipped.
There is no doubt whatever about it.
That hat matches the suit.
How is this possible?
I have three times as many books as him.
Why were you in Boston?
"That is not an orange, either."
This is the plate that Tom ate off of.
It rains a lot in Okinawa.
The question is whether Tom can be trusted.
We just had to deal with it.
Tom giggled girlishly.
I know Tom can't speak French very well.
Read books that are worthwhile.
I took the wrong bus.
Her mother is a most beautiful woman.
Most Americans like hamburgers.
You wouldn't have recognized Tom.
Two years have passed since we parted.
Mary looks good in that red dress.
Tom will never stop.
Tom carefully picked up the broken glass.
Stay out of it.
Have you made sure the door is locked?
Tom pleaded guilty and is now in prison.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
What's your favorite video game?
That will do.
I basically like your plan.
Both of my parents are not strict with me.
Mary isn't my sister.
I was able to answer the question correctly.
I think that Tom is still sleepy.
I won't let anyone push me around.
I was a high school student at that time.
I knew nobody would believe me.
I'm calling because my credit card has been stolen.
Tom doesn't remember where he put his keys.
I want you to wear your new dress.
He likes it when I do that.
Please explain this sentence to me.
I'm not able to speak so fast.
Tom isn't waiting anymore.
My mother has four brothers.
You don't have to go to school today.
It won't take long.
Tom majored in music education.
I sometimes dream of home.
I want to know that what I'm doing is right.
Tom is a weirdo.
He never opens his mouth without complaining about something.
She was asked to convince him to get his son or someone else to paint the house.
I've been waiting for over an hour.
Tom made dinner.
We're not sure where Tom is.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
I was wondering if I could buy you a drink.
Tom isn't as intelligent as Mary.
I like tennis.
Why are you so arrogant?
Tom is easily provoked.
I'd like to buy this computer.
He was seen crossing the road.
I'd advise against it.
We met last week.
This sort of thing happens.
"Don't worry. He may look intimidating at first glance, but he's actually a very friendly person."
I'd like my coffee weak.
Can you take this stuff with you?
Is Sunday the first day of the week?
He can speak five languages.
You don't have to answer this question.
Apples are the best fruit.
I'm running behind schedule.
We didn't find a weapon.
She went to the train station to see him off.
Tom's car is gone.
"If I were to tell you the truth, you would be surprised."
Have you heard anything from Tom?
You are a workaholic.
"He has no wife, no children and no friends."
His plan is to build a bridge over that river.
Their goods are of the highest quality.
Has Tom ever asked you to loan him money?
"I don't want to get married, but I want to have kids."
"Is she young? ""Yes, she is."""
They all stood up at the same time.
We can pay.
Where are your grandchildren?
He was aware of the danger.
Is that your final decision?
It scares me.
Can you complete the job in two days?
Please tell us something about yourself.
I would like to help you.
He was sent abroad as a correspondent.
I love Tom and at the same time I hate him.
I got up early to catch the first train.
It's raining here.
This one is ours.
It was a good try.
The rest of us all had the smoked salmon.
We've been trying to keep it a secret.
I'm not going to miss Tom.
It's your decision.
Tell Tom that I'm not hungry.
We're not finished with negotiations.
Tom arrived at just the right moment.
Tom and Mary fell in love while they were on a scientific expedition.
You are not going to make it in time for school.
I bit my tongue.
He was made captain of the team.
Let's start without Tom.
Do you have any complaints?
"He is not really a friend, just an acquaintance."
His low salary prevents him from buying the house.
Tom didn't want to let the opportunity pass him by.
You have a very strange way of thinking.
She is not young.
Tom applauded.
Why don't you come on in?
I'm not so sure.
You know how it is.
I was the one who taught Tom how to read.
I hope that Tom will never do that again.
I'm dropping out of school.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
I am baking bread.
Please relax.
I couldn't have done this without him.
Tom's out cold.
He betrayed my confidence.
I won't return.
We changed everything.
It's the logical thing to do.
Kissing is fun.
I want a room with a shower.
I suppose so.
Tom did nothing.
The towels are dirty.
Please step aside.
I'm going to tell you everything.
She is in the kitchen because she's making dinner.
Your new hair style makes you look older.
Did I ask your opinion?
Your nose is bleeding.
Tom went to see Mary in Boston.
Why are we stopping?
Ask at the police box over there.
Tom died before the rescuers arrived.
No one can help you.
She doesn't speak English as fluently as you.
He went to America last week.
The earth is round.
Tom likes to wear dark colors.
You're untalented.
Right now I'm at the airport.
Can you see without your glasses?
Make it smaller.
My vet told me to feed my dog in the evening.
Do you want to know why I'm here?
Two pages of the book stuck together.
How much did you have to drink?
Tom wears a different tie every day.
He acquired American citizenship.
Let me check my schedule.
Everybody likes polite people.
I caught five fish yesterday.
When are you off?
Tom's French is perfect.
Tom is my brother.
He cleared the roof of snow.
I don't like his way of talking.
Tom knows something's up.
My brother goes to college in Tokyo.
It is you who is to blame.
Don't be ridiculous!
Living in the town is quite different from living in the country.
How long did you work for Tom?
That company produces microchips.
I'd love to visit Boston.
The opening ceremony took place on schedule.
Tom tries to write a new blog entry every day.
I have another good idea.
I don't like the substitute teacher.
He knows the truth.
You've been a great help.
She bought some paper that she could use for writing letters.
It isn't easy to understand his ideas.
Tom is a very patient man.
I don't smell anything.
I like living here.
Tom didn't want to pay that much.
There's a church behind my house.
Your lives may be in danger.
The toilet is upstairs.
He doesn't care much for baseball.
I didn't know the woman at all.
She has five older brothers.
How about a walk?
Tom refused to continue to ignore the way Mary was behaving at school.
Tom can't play the guitar.
Not even one taxi stopped.
It just doesn't work that way.
"You're not in a hurry, are you?"
"She said she was twenty years old, which was not true."
Tom feels a bit under the weather today.
I do not know when she will come back.
It'll be really lonely without you.
I prefer cats to dogs.
Tom hurried away.
The man she's going to marry is an astronaut.
Don't take it seriously.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
The accident is still vivid in his memory.
No one can help us.
I want a chair.
"To make matters worse, it began snowing."
Am I in your way?
Tom shot a bear.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
Baby animals are cute.
Let me go first.
We hit it off.
This fountain pen is as good as any I have ever used.
Come at once.
I don't know anything about her family.
Tom is a very creative person.
Tom doesn't know what to buy Mary for her birthday.
I hardly ever wear my red sweater.
Tom didn't have enough money to pay his rent.
Tom was the only one who knew the answer.
There was green slime oozing out of the pipe.
She caught a cold last night.
I'd rather not do domestic work.
We intend to change that.
"Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?"
She lived a quiet life in the country.
"A good book is the best of friends, the same today and forever."
Almost no one believed him.
Did you see grandpa's wheelchair?
Tom had to sell his house.
I added his name to the list.
Tom and Mary picked up a hitchhiker.
It's your decision.
Don't fail to call me as soon as you arrive there.
Tom is untrustworthy.
There was a drop in temperature after the rain.
Do you think it'll be that easy?
Tom loved running.
What do you think about the book?
The only pear left on the tree is rotten.
Write it down before you forget it.
Tom can change.
Stop filming.
I was on the train for twelve hours.
Is there anyone who speaks English?
He likes taking care of the garden.
People who are afraid of making mistakes will make no progress in English conversation.
Is that the best Tom can do?
Tides are caused by the moon's gravity.
I can't share that information with you.
The plan will be brought into effect tomorrow.
Tom showed her the letter from Santa Claus.
The train was so packed that I had to stand up during the whole trip.
Tom is an arrogant idiot.
He was imprisoned.
Tom is unemployed.
Is this love?
Tom never listens to me.
I talked with her for an hour.
What have you given me?
Where is your money?
Tom broke into Mary's car and stole what was hidden under the driver's seat.
Tom wondered what Mary was thinking about.
The table was covered with dust.
She has no sense of beauty.
I spoke as quietly as I could.
He is smart enough to answer all the questions.
Did you hear the news on the radio this morning?
Is your dog mean?
This book is mine. Where is yours?
Tom grinned.
Corn is an important crop in the United States.
I don't need them anymore.
I'm trying to talk to you.
Are you absolutely certain about this?
You've missed the boat.
Don't play with matches.
It is rude to point at people.
Not everybody can be an artist.
You have to sit down.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
We go fishing together once in a while.
Tom shouldn't make fun of Mary.
I can talk to him for hours.
We never talk.
Tom came to all three of my weddings.
Set it down there.
Can we have a moment alone?
I know what we can do.
It never snows here.
When did you hear the news?
Are you related to Tom?
I miss my parents.
Are you a doctor?
"No, I don't want to."
I think the train will come soon.
I'm certain that Tom will pass the exam.
I don't particularly want to see the game.
It was well worth the cost.
Why would you do something like that?
I recognized Tom at once by his voice.
He doesn't listen.
Choose one person.
Tom urged Mary to study harder.
You'd better go home.
I don't want you to quit correcting my mistakes.
A shiver ran down my spine.
I said get out.
Tom just took a chance and called Mary to ask her out.
I just need to ask Tom some questions.
I didn't stay there very long.
"Who helped you? ""Tom did."""
You'd better not go out today.
Were there many guests at the dinner?
Is Tom lying?
Tom had to go there.
Which one do you like best?
It's a long story.
I can't stand kids.
My daugther wants a kitten.
I want to see them again.
How many people are in your crew?
The man passed by without so much as glancing at her.
That can cause big problems.
China is a large country.
How many boys are there in this class?
Tom has been in Australia for three years.
Tom doesn't appear to be nervous.
There's no hope.
The rain made it impossible for us to go on the picnic.
I think Tom will like this.
I saw a fly on the ceiling.
Who lives here?
Don't be late to school again.
They all appeared satisfied with your answers.
"Hurry up, child!"
How did you guys first meet each other?
What are you selling?
Do you want anything?
Tom and his friends often play cards until after midnight.
Let's split.
I'm just curious.
Why don't you understand?
I forgot to put it on the list.
I hope it's not too late.
Tom had to have his stomach pumped because he had accidentally eaten some rat poison.
Do you often hug your children?
I told you I don't know how to do that.
We don't have long.
Do you like cooking?
No one knows the future.
You had better get up early.
He's been sick in bed for four days.
She finished her coffee and asked for another.
What are you into these days?
I wish I could travel around the world.
Every member of the cabinet was present.
I want us to be friends again.
Don't you miss your father?
It started to rain.
Where are you?
Spring follows winter.
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
Tom declined the invitation to Mary's party.
Thank you for saving my life.
Don't you want Tom to do that for you?
Tom closed his eyes as the nurse inserted the needle into his arm.
Tom is fair.
Tom raises rabbits for meat.
Tom bought a camera for Mary.
It's my job to help people like you.
He is a gentleman. He cannot have said such a thing.
Please wait for me.
A bad workman always blames his tools.
Where on earth did you meet him?
"I have written many plays, but never a poem."
Is that it?
We don't like it.
Tom is moving in.
I want to learn English.
Is that the picture you took of Tom yesterday?
Tom looks awake.
"Now, what was your name again?"
"By the way, did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?"
Do you have anything to eat?
You've just got to try harder.
This book will do.
Put the book back where it was.
You still owe me one.
Here's the money I owe you.
Can you eat raw oysters?
I don't want it.
Tom hopes Mary doesn't end up in jail.
That's his specialty.
I had the feeling that something wasn't right.
I can't let you sacrifice yourself.
"It doesn't matter whether I'm sleeping or awake, I'm always thinking about you."
Could you help us translate this text?
I'd like you to see this.
Tom was sick of his job.
How's that going to help?
I was laughed at by him.
I like to dream.
I don't remember it.
He read the book yesterday.
It's not hard to find.
That isn't likely to be a problem.
I don't care what you say.
You've bought more stamps than needed.
"You're not going to wear that, are you?"
She gave me this compact disc.
Can we afford it?
"What he said about girls holds true of boys, too."
Don't trust anybody.
"Tom has a couple of tattoos, doesn't he?"
Can you suggest a better idea?
"Apparently, Tom is still alive."
Anything could happen in a place like this.
I need something smaller.
Don't look for us.
I thought you'd already been compensated for that.
Please address your mail clearly and correctly.
The fire reduced the house to ashes.
"The serial killer was cold and distant during his trial, and appeared unaffected by the fact that he had murdered so many people."
Do you really want me to go there right now?
We tried.
Tom is good at arithmetic.
That's a delicate problem.
We'll never reach London before dark.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
"The last time you saw her, she was just a tiny baby."
I'm not going to tell you the reason.
I fell asleep.
What's Tom going to do for Mary?
This is not going to end well.
I'm very tired now.
Tom is a very perceptive man.
I just saw Tom kissing Mary.
I'm not going to say no.
I think he ate about 10 oysters.
They were so different.
I think Tom has been punished enough.
My wife's constant nagging really gets on my nerves.
How many cups of tea do you drink a day?
Tom and Mary can't afford to buy a house.
That's the last straw.
He is selling it just as it is.
You can't imagine how humiliating this is.
They are facing financial problems.
"Now that you have made your decision, you must act."
The morning sun is too bright to look at.
How did you celebrate New Year's Eve?
I let Tom know that I was dissatisfied with his performance.
He wouldn't allow me to drive his car.
The world is running out of oil.
Cut the bell peppers into two-inch strips.
Tom will carry those suitcases for you.
I want to see how Tom lives.
I wish Tom had never gotten out of prison.
Does Tom still go to school?
"It's not his idea, it's mine."
I really enjoyed your company.
Telephone me if it rains.
"On Mondays, he's always at home."
"When Tom told Mary to feel right at home, he was secretly hoping that she'd go and wash up the dishes in the kitchen."
Will you go with us?
I found the picture you were looking for.
Do you need money?
Did you ever call Tom?
Did you know my father?
Police are trained to use weapons.
Have you ever stepped on a tomato?
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
The diamond appears genuine.
"If he could speak English, I would employ him right away."
What does Tom have on?
Tom ordered a cup of coffee.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to go.
Do you happen to know the date of the exam?
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
Tom was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.
Do as he tells you.
I can't see you anymore.
Did they understand?
I wish I had the courage to speak about my feelings.
Tom is the one.
She can skate.
Tom stirred his tea.
She deliberately ignored me on the street.
"I said nothing, which made her angry."
That statistic is completely made up.
Lack of flexibility is an obstacle to progress.
He contributed to the good of the community.
Don't bother me with such trifles.
The book is small.
I thought I'd go with Tom.
Tom never eats spinach.
I can imagine how you felt.
"Once upon a time, there was an old man in this village."
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
They stayed at the hotel for a week.
I'm not even sure whether Tom will come or not.
We're in mourning.
Don't feel embarrassed. These things happen.
What he is saying does not make sense.
I am a big fan of the arts.
"After the game, he went straight home to feed his dog."
She's still under age.
I've been waiting for you since two o'clock.
I played with Tom and Mary today.
I wasn't flirting.
North is the opposite direction from south.
I don't know what to answer.
I want you here tomorrow by 2:30.
Are you from Kyoto?
I think you'll regret it if you don't at least try it.
"The other day, I met him in Kyoto."
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
Half of the apples are rotten.
I advised her to come by 9:00.
I remember having seen him somewhere before.
"Excuse me, but could you get me a glass of water?"
He likes to work in the garden.
The pleasure was mine.
I don't really like the stores there.
Thank you for coming early.
I'll let you know when it's done.
The parking lot in front of the bank was completely full.
Is this permissible?
I'm on campus at the moment.
Please relax.
I have neither time nor money.
Summer is over.
Why did you buy flowers?
"Tom will eventually give in, I think."
I wouldn't want you to think I was mean.
I think Tom is a good leader.
Tom felt hated.
You learn more from trying to repair a TV than from watching one.
He became rich through hard work.
Tom said that he wanted to see the manager.
I used to play with my sister in the park.
Tom put some rice in a bowl.
Tom knew what Mary wanted to buy.
Say hello to Tom for me.
Give that to me.
My mother tasted the milk.
Tom got the job on the strength of your recommendation.
They were forced to kill and eat several of their horses.
Tom can answer.
I wonder if what I wrote was correct.
Why is Tom absent?
Many people lost their homes after the earthquake.
Do you have an English dictionary?
I don't want to be friends with Tom.
Where do you want this?
Do you drink wine?
"Some juice, please."
Can you draw me a map of your street?
Her faith in God is unshaken.
Would you like another serving?
"When Tom was a kid, he used to pretend he was playing the drums by tapping his fingers on the kitchen table, to the great irritation of his father."
How are you guys doing?
He is teaching Arabic.
I'll lend you this book.
I'll help any way I can.
Take as many as you want.
Vote for me!
He is outgoing.
The other one doesn't work.
He is not conscious of his own faults.
Did you take him back to your apartment?
Do you know your size?
What should I tell the kids now?
We cannot deal with such a difficult problem.
Tom says that he doesn't feel like jogging.
You haven't paid me yet.
She gave me a watch for a birthday present.
I was born on the 31st of May in 1940.
Tom thought that Mary was lying.
Tom looks lonely.
Tom has never played poker with us.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Tom doesn't know what Mary wants to do.
Tom and Mary held hands as they watched the fog roll in.
He tried many different methods.
I'll arrive on October 20th.
There have been a lot of airplane accidents recently.
What are your strong points?
Will you help us?
Tom has worked as a carpenter since 2013.
Go ahead!
I'd like you to attend the meeting tomorrow.
Hurry up! The concert is starting.
Do you think it'll be that easy?
We season with salt.
I may be able to help you.
Mail service in that country is not quick.
How long have you guys known each other?
I am more worried about you than the future of Japan.
Tom wants to take a day off.
Do you really want to fight?
Tom was sitting alone in his room.
A lot still remains to be done.
Everything was fine until Tom started drinking.
Today is a national holiday.
Tom does like you. I'm sure of it.
I was eating lunch when the phone rang.
The following was inspired in part by a true story.
Everyone was hungry.
Can you call me a taxi?
Don't blame Tom.
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
Does the room have a bath?
Tom wondered why Mary didn't like him.
"I'm sorry, but I can't hear you well."
I've paid you already.
I have a stuffed-up nose.
Tom played a Spanish folk tune on his English horn at a Chinese restaurant in France.
Someone's singing.
Tom is happy to see Mary.
Tom knows that Mary loves John.
It's very easy to miss this kind of mistake.
Did you eat your spinach?
Tom paid the cashier.
Tom isn't rich.
Why do you keep provoking them?
Do you know how to do this?
My mother made me practice the piano every day when I was a kid.
It's Tom's voice.
Tom appeared busy.
You must think I'm really strange.
I have to go to bed.
It's very kind of you to help me with my homework.
Tom says he doesn't think he could do that without our help.
"Not everyone can come to our party. ""Who's not coming?"""
"Hey, what's this?"
Reading is one of life's great pleasures.
"You are a schoolteacher, aren't you?"
She helped him tie his tie.
I'm surprised that he accepted the offer.
Please tell me you're joking.
I know you want to keep it a secret.
We'll follow Tom.
Tom and Mary were looking at each other.

This shower is broken.
Tom knows some French.
She's two years older than him.
When are you going to see Tom again?

We never asked you to do that.
I was caught in a traffic jam.
Tom was remarkably shy.
No one left.
Put the book on the bottom shelf.

Do you have a driver's license?
Are you saying you don't want to go?
What color is your car?
Please turn around and look at me.
Do you have hard evidence?

I just saw a huge owl.
This is a terrible mistake.
I ran into an old friend.
I just asked myself that same question.
Tom put the map on the table.
Tom isn't going to listen to us.
We got married.

Tom seldom breaks his promise.
Tom doesn't need to know who gave this to us.
How do you like your new car?
That's what I've been saying all along.
That's cheating.
The train is ten minutes late.
You can't have any of this cake.
You must make the decision on your own.

Lead is easily bent.
I will sue you.
Did you enjoy the movie?
Why don't you listen?

He doesn't mean to be mean. It's just his nature.
I wish I were rich.

I'm a childhood friend of Tom's.
It was raining last night.
Her nose is bleeding.
The road curves gently towards the west.
"For some reason, it's not working."
I gave him a few books.
"In some ways, Boston is nicer than Chicago."
We have to do without sugar.
It is said that she is a good cook.
Please tell me it's a joke.

Turn it off.
How long do I have to stay in the hospital?
His men began their attack on Mexico City.

This room is used by teachers.
Everything that I saw was completely different from what I had expected.

Tom realized that Mary might be busy.
Do you think Tom has been brainwashed?
What Tom said doesn't make sense.
He set fire to his own house.
Vote for Tom.
Tom read anything he could lay his hands on.
Does it work?
It is not a matter to laugh about.
"Everywhere he went, he taught love, patience, and most of all, non-violence."
She helped him tie his tie.
"Would you like something to drink? ""A coffee, please."""
Can I go surfing?

I wasn't listening to the radio.

Why didn't you tell me that Tom had a daughter?
Are you forgetful?
This room is very stuffy.

This book isn't too bad.
Is eating liver bad for you?
It's work.
Tom listened to what Mary was saying.
The other team has some really good players.
I enjoyed your company.

"That's my umbrella, not Tom's."
Do you want to join us for some drinks?

I think you know why I summoned you.
I explained the rules to her.
Where did you buy your schoolbag?

Why don't you get one?
Let me speak to Tom first.
You're contributing.

What do you think of all this?
Could we talk about last night?
We can worry about the other problems later.
Tom and I have some classes together.
Tom is in London on business now.
"If you act like a child, you'll be treated like a child."
"Even if I had wished to stop, I couldn't."
Tom doesn't like grapes.
He took a day off.
We're really drunk.
I like your coffee.
I don't remember having had any toys when I was young.
I got here as fast as I could.
Where does your grandpa live?
Have you been waited on?
Tom is going to pick me up after school.
I am disgusted with him.
Are you mad?
Could you please tell me your height and weight?
Tom lives here alone.
Tom and Mary are holding hands.
I don't want an apology. I want an explanation.
Mary hiked her skirt up to mid-thigh and dipped her toes in the water.
"Tom looked around the room, but he didn't see Mary."
I haven't lied to you.
Will you lend me your bicycle for an hour?
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
They'll look after me.
I can't look at this anymore.
"Tom doesn't want to do that, does he?"
I did it the old fashioned way.
I've written three letters.
You have very sexy legs.
Life isn't always simple.
I'm not your doll.
Tom was delighted.
We watch TV every day.
Who do you think the murderer is?
I made a list.
Do you usually have tea for breakfast?
Watch yourselves.
I'm a lot taller than Tom is.
My youngest sister sings very well.
Our team won 3 to 1.
Tom regrets his mistake.
Do you study chemistry?
"All of a sudden, the fire alarm went off."
Did you eat all your vegetables?
I owe what I am today to my parents.
"I study French, too."
I'm really bored right now.
That was a funny movie.
"I told her not to let go of the rope, but she did."
He asked after you.
I've never seen that kind of tree before.
I was beginning to worry.
Is today Monday?
The citizens of this small community don't condone public displays of affection.
What platform does the downtown train leave from?
We shook hands.
She is much younger than Tom.
I don't speak to Tom.
Is everybody all right?
Let's get off the bus.
Tom believes that the government wants to hide the truth about aliens.
I pay someone to do that for me.
How many boys are there in this class?
I wish things were different.
She isn't lonely anymore.
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
I am happy that you are my friend.
Tom will never notice the difference.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
He seems to be wary of us.
Do you know much about music?
Where did you two meet?
I didn't receive even one letter from her.
Tom doesn't know me.
Be careful not to fall overboard.
Tom's partner thought that they should also sell gourmet popcorn seasonings.
Tom put the book on the table.
Tom thought Mary was in the room.
The man must be insane.
Tom isn't skinny.

What's your new book about?
He was awarded a special prize.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
I want to know what that is.
We used to go camping when I was a kid.
Tom and Mary looked at each other with concerned expressions on their faces.
I was angry at myself.
"Rules are meant to be kept, not broken."
"Starting next week, we'll be using a new textbook."
Tom has plenty of money in the bank.
We tried to convince Tom not to do it.
What are the dimensions of the room?
He said his father was an architect and that he wanted to be one too.
Recently I've been feeling a bit down.
I don't remember who gave me this.
Let's put the past behind us.
You always take the lion's share!
I want to buy some ski boots.
"I not only gave him some advice, I also gave him a bicycle."
I wonder where I put my glasses.
She is opening the window.
The policeman shone his flashlight into the house.
It'll be spring soon.
"Please keep quiet, so you don't wake the baby up."
Tom tried to keep calm.
Tom was unharmed.
I already miss Tom.
He must have left the water running.
Could you bring me a blanket?
The library is on the second floor.
She fell down and broke her left leg.
Tom grew up in the ghetto.
That's how he invented the machine.
This time I'm very optimistic.
Tom is only partially right.
The ceremony was impressive.
Tom gets bored easily.
You guys need new shoes.
Let bygones be bygones.
He's doing a handstand.
I know how important this is to you.
Do you like it here?
We're very disappointed.
This rule has no exceptions.
This is the worst movie I have ever seen.
Tom put some clothes on.
She had a bad tooth taken out.
Mathematics is my favorite subject.
He was wearing glasses.
My parents don't know where I am.
The party's over.
Why do we need it?
You're wasteful.
This is a lion.
I think I left the water running.
It isn't a dream.
Did you sew this by hand?
It was almost too easy.
I have to return this book to the library today.

Six months later we were married.
How much will it cost?
My brother is a good skater.
We'll start tomorrow morning.
Keep Tom guessing.
It's useless to argue.
Tom tried to get Mary to do his chores.
When was the last time you had lunch out?
No one knows his real name.
She tried to prevent the rumor from spreading.
No one thinks Tom is worthy of praise.
These are the originals.
I swear I'll tell you everything someday.
I was just about to leave.
What were you doing down there?
I'm sorry if my words hurt you.
We got to the station at six.
Tom broke up with his girlfriend.
We'll work tomorrow.
Tom checked his notes.
How's your father?
Tom began to look into the problem as soon as Mary brought it to his attention.
I nearly starved.
This is not about money.
My sister has traced our family tree back to the 16th century.
She liked him right off.
Where were you on the night of October 20th?
Don't worry about it.
I'd like to know why you did what you did.
This beach is a paradise for surfers.
I'm going to sit on the bench over there next to the street lamp.
How long do you plan to stay?
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
Where is the nearest station?
It's been over a year since the accident.
I want this matter taken care of immediately.
That's not what I'm looking for.
I haven't seen Tom in ages.
Do you think they suspect me?
The king went hunting this morning.
Is that why you've stayed?
"Open the door, please."
You have to fill out this form.
Tom was promoted to foreman.
They don't know each other very well.
The surface of the object is fairly rough.
I'm happy doing what I do.
Come on in and make yourself at home.
I haven't seen you for ages.
I have to say I envy you.
"Sorry, I couldn't catch what you said."
We live near the large library.
What other choice did I have?
What's your favorite food?
He's homeward bound.
Do you remember what you said to me?
He is the least likely to come.
You're almost as old as I am.
Tom took off his glasses.
Your bicycle is much newer than mine.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
I don't think Tom is able to do that anymore.
Everyone is special.
A cab is waiting.
Will this medicine really do me any good?
Why don't you take off your coat?
"Well, have you decided?"
I'm not sick.
Tom and Mary must really like each other.
Please write about your real experience.
Tom and Mary are both college students.
There must be a way to arrive at a diplomatic solution.
Leave my camera alone.
Tom hugged Mary.
Do you want to know what happened to Tom?
Tom always remembers to say thank you.
Drive carefully.

Tom predicted it.
Bring along your friend.
I'm much heavier than you.
I don't like to wear shoes without socks.
Some of the money was stolen.
Tom has escaped.
This afternoon I feel very tired.
It's not a joke.
I don't understand what's bothering you.
Don't bother me with such trifles.
I'd like to show this picture of Tom to you.
My father died five years ago.
Dreaming costs nothing.
How did you first meet Tom?
Promise me you'll do that.
I can hide anywhere.
I'm a nurse.
Tom's afraid.
She wanted to be a teacher.
I didn't even know that.
I found it on the street.
How about tomorrow?
You never say what you really think.
He is no longer welcome here.
I look like my father.
How did you first meet Tom?
Tom usually only eats oatmeal for breakfast.
Tom said he'd kill me if he ever saw me again.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
I was feeling blue all day.
My hobby is reading novels.
The new bridge is under construction.
You keep out of this.
You don't look sick to me.
Who does this dog belong to?
Blue looks good on you.
Did you put Tom up to it?
My father neither smokes nor drinks.
I'm not sleepy.
The decision has been made.
This guy is a loser.
Tom was unreliable.
Tom was one of us.
"After that incident, he never drank again."
Tom couldn't open the door.
Tom is the only adult in the room.

How do you usually decide what to eat?
She's in a fairly bad mood now.
That's sweet of you.
Do you eat seaweed in your country?
Does it work?
Mary doesn't usually wear makeup.
Tom spoke highly of you.
Don't make Tom do that.
I need you to drive me to the station.
I like you.
I'm sorry I was rude before.
This book is about China.
I had fun at school today.
He has more money than he can use.
Two nurses attended to the patient.
"Pass me the salt, will you?"
We have agreed to continue the negotiations.
I can't remember the melody to that song.
Do you expect me to believe that?
I might be able to help you tomorrow.
I'll do what needs to be done.
I'd do anything for Tom.
You must work hard in order not to fail.
Tom climbed down from the tree.
"In March, many flowers come out."
The teacher asked us to clean our classroom every day.
I'm afraid she will turn down my request.
Japanese is my mother tongue.
Tom used to play poker with us.
How's Tom's cold?
I'll see you on Monday in Boston.
I apologize for Tom's behavior.
Will you please lend me a stapler?
You should never cut corners on safety.
He is from France.
Have you ever been betrayed by a good friend?
I have only two classes this year.
Tom's got a tremendous amount of work to do.
Tom asked Mary to call him later.
That's an interesting topic.
I should have tried out this electric shaver before buying it.
There's no point in denying it anymore.
You could've saved me a lot of trouble if you'd told me about that earlier.
Do you like facial hair on men?
It could've been worse.
"Yesterday, I bought a red car."
I know what's going on.
When is the next bus to Park Street?
"I know it's kind of late, but would you mind if I came over now? I have something I need to discuss with you."
He is always on the go.
A limo has just pulled up outside.
Life goes by pretty fast.
Tom grew anxious.
I didn't know that Tom was that old.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
Tom isn't interested in art at all.
We need to talk.
Are you Japanese?
She waved goodbye to me.
This document is classified.
Are you seriously thinking about divorce?
It tasted sweet.
He was silly enough to believe her.
I expect Tom will be late.
He cleaned his room on Sunday.
That was not the only problem.
We've got a lot to talk about.
Tom was unable to remember what he had eaten for breakfast.
He is a jealous man.
I'll take the next bus.
Tom continued to stare out the window.
"As you know, I've lost my job, so I'm having trouble making ends meet."
My father's birthday falls on Sunday this year.
Rural life appeals to me very much.
Tom poured a bucket of ice-cold water on himself.
It is necessary for you to work hard.
Tom got back in his car and drove away.
He might have lost his way.
Tom and Mary live in a restored medieval castle.
Tom sent Mary a Christmas card.

Do you know what Tom is doing now?
Do you want another one of these?
Am I that transparent?
"In a few years, we'll all be doing that."
Do you know what day it is today?
I just learned to play poker.
Let Tom come aboard.
He went to the bank and changed his money.
I can't wait for spring to come so we can sit under the cherry trees.
I broke Tom's nose.
"If there's anything you want to do, you should do it if it makes you happy."
Who're you looking for?
I plan to go to Boston next Monday to see Tom.
You can't carry on like this.
He ran his fingers through her hair.
This gift is for you.
"Seeing that it is raining, you had better stay home."
I followed the bus.
Tom and I went there on our honeymoon.
He's taking a shower.
I have a question for you.
I didn't hear what you said.
We disputed for hours about what to write.
Where's your bag?
Whose food is this?
All your problems have been solved.
Tom appears to be sleeping.
Yesterday was hot.
The police are responsible for the maintenance of law and order.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom seems to be in a fairly bad mood now.
I can't stand that noise any longer.
I'm beginning to doubt it.
We just got back.
Do you have a Twitter account?
Tom isn't very religious.
Adaptation is the key to survival.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this now.
What'll you do when Tom gets here?
My brother went to Italy.
I'm very surprised to see you here.
I don't know yet.
Tom and Mary are proud of their son.
Someone is in the kitchen with Tom.
Tom disappeared three months ago.
Take this book back to him.
"Tom has money, but I don't."
Has Tom been charged?
Tom didn't believe me.
Tom opened the window to get some fresh air.
You're paying.
Put the box on the table in the kitchen.
I know what's in the box.
Tom took a sip of his margarita and smiled.
Who does this suitcase belong to?
I really like this song.
I'd appreciate any help you can give me.
We were all shocked.
Tom isn't jealous.
I noticed I was being observed.
Could you put this coat somewhere?
Let me see the pictures.
People are really stupid sometimes.
I hope the weather will hold for another day.
Tom hasn't made much progress.
You're wearing your T-shirt inside out.
I'll do what Tom says.
Do you know that hotel?
You did that on purpose.
When can I move in?
Why is my life so boring?
I want you to help us find out who killed Tom.
What's that called?
Do you know where Tom is going?
You're going to like Tom.
I think you should tell Tom that you love him.
I think it wouldn't be too hard to come up with a better system.

What's that about?
The cheesecake tasted too sweet.
Our company has many clients from abroad.
"Can I have two hamburgers and a coke, please?"
This medicine must not be placed within the reach of children.
I barely have enough money for groceries.
I felt the engine running.
Tom was watching what was happening very carefully.
Are you telling me you don't know where Tom lives?
I tried for almost an hour.
Tom said goodbye to me.
We were all worried.
I'm trying to figure out a solution.
Tom was elected mayor in 2013.

Do you really need that?
You have to listen to me.
I gave her some candy.
You've got better things to do with your time.
Tom wanted to keep John and Mary apart.
I want you to go see a doctor.
Tom never told anybody about what happened.
Did you say something?
Who wants tea?
You should treat people with more respect.
I had a great night.
They're cousins.
Tom now has a good reason to be happy.
Do you want me to go up there?
You won't be shot.
How can I explain this?
Tom can explain.
We need to find an antidote.
How do you come to that conclusion?
Any further discussion is pointless.
Tom had to pay a few more dollars.
Did you enjoy it?
Can you make yourselves understood in English?
I'd like to be alone now.
I'd like to know Tom's whereabouts.
Thank you for asking.
She looked worried about her school report.
"Her sister I like very much, but her brother I do not like."
You had better go to the dentist's.
She told me the wrong address on purpose.
You can't park around here.
How did you get the job?
He went out without saying goodbye to me.
What you said really got me thinking.
You are expected to pass the exam.

French is one of the languages I've always wanted to learn.
That never changes.

Tom is very talented.
That's right.
Four families were killed in the fire.
How curious!

It'll snow today.
He is rich and I am poor.
You don't need to go at once.

There are only two days left.
Usually I go to bed after midnight.

He changed his mind.
Mary likes you.
She will be the first Japanese woman astronaut.
She had no idea what I said.
Everybody panicked.
They are not interested in saving money.
That's what they pay me for.
Tom said he didn't find it funny.
He is having lunch.
That's all I saw.

Why's everything so dark?
Tom was stabbed to death by someone on the subway.
The teacher told us that we couldn't eat in the classroom.
We need to do something about this.
Has your dog ever bitten you?

He hates carrots.
Nobody deserves to die like that.

My trip to Australia is officially booked.
Tom kissed Mary goodbye at the airport gate.
The trip out was more pleasant than the return.
The vase that he broke is my aunt's.
Is it that hard?

You're really a nice person.
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
I still think it's unlikely that we'll find any evidence to prove Tom's guilt.

I don't think Tom has any brothers or sisters.
Tom did a very stupid thing.

The break is over.
Tell me who you saw.

That's not what I'm going to do.
I have no time to help you with the work.
Where is the closest train station?

What do you want from me?
I'm here for you.
How can I get to heaven?
"Once a thief, always a thief."
What'll you give Tom?
I just can't understand you sometimes.
There's no call to get angry over this matter.
He usually looks through the newspapers before breakfast.
Tom is definitely not stupid. He's just lazy.
Do you want to be here?
It's obvious that you're wrong.
Perhaps he knows this story.
He is a teacher rather than a writer.
"Envious people die, but envy never does."

Make an appointment with him.
The second lesson is very simple.

The mountain is covered with snow.

I will protect you from danger.
Is Tom doing better?
What is the language spoken in Brazil?
I know exactly where it is.

"You're students, aren't you?"
How did Tom find out?
Tom was on television last night.
I want you to see this.

How long have you been learning French?
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
Consider it a gift.
We keep three dogs and a cat.
You are not welcome in my home anymore.

Are you ever going to tell me what happened that night?

Is Tom busy?
He said that you had better go.
Tom looked through the file.
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
Tom isn't present.
Tom knocked on the door and Mary answered it.
Why didn't you just ask?
I was skeptical.
I've got some bad news.
Look at that building.
"In 2009, coyotes killed 2,500 sheep and 12,000 lambs in the state of Montana."
Tom doesn't want to do this.
You don't have to go to the party unless you want to.

I knew I'd find you here.
Don't put it that way.

I think that's too expensive.
I don't know a lot of jokes.
Tom spends a lot of money traveling.
What's your favorite soccer team?
We're reliable.

Tom knows Mary better than anyone else.
I just saw an opossum.

Tell me again who will be helping us.
This is where Tom used to sit.
She put on her hat.
Let's finish the job.

It happened completely by accident.
Tom is good at skiing.
They keep forgetting to pay the bills.
I don't care what it costs.
He's active and fit.
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?
Sign here.
We talked until two in the morning.
Tom didn't feel like waiting.
Tom doesn't want you to know the truth.
"He has money, but he's not happy."
Wolves won't usually attack people.
Why are you wearing those clothes?
You don't seem convinced.
There's no one with Tom.
Have a nice weekend.
You look like your father looked thirty years ago.
I'll miss that.
There are many possible answers to that question.
I'm not lonely anymore.
Tom fell down on the floor.
You are absolutely correct.
Everybody at school knows your name.
I'm a teacher.
I'd be willing to do that.
"Tom, do you want to go with me?"
You can't see Tom today.
It was in London that I last saw her.
The most important thing to do now is for us to remain calm.
Tom realized that Mary was right.
Aren't you going to eat with us?
The experiment confirmed his theory.
"Come on, admit it."
Tom freaked out.
Let's end this fast.
I wonder why he is late.
I guess I was too busy to notice that Tom was having problems.
This is about all I can put up with.
I guess I just got lucky this time.
"Before deciding, I would like to consult with my family."
I'm sorry to have caused you so much trouble.
Tom knows that he'll be punished.
Tom may not go to Australia until next spring.
"Tom opened the door, expecting to see Mary."
I have to speak to Tom immediately.
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
"Blind people read by touching, using a system of raised dots called Braille."
One thing I've always wanted to do is run my own restaurant.
Tom drank some poison by mistake.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
She is away in Kyushu.
The man was a total stranger.
This watch is a real bargain.
He won the race again.
I know that you're a teacher.
He enjoys playing tennis.
This diagram will illustrate what I mean.
What's Tom wearing?
What did he look up?
"Tom sat alone at the kitchen table, drinking a cup of coffee."
Tom has to be home by 2:30.
Nobody kissed Tom.
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
When is a good time for you?
Did you remember to do what I asked you to do?
The ship slowly started to move.
Tom had no idea how rich Mary was.
Guide dogs help blind people.
I will confirm my plane reservation.
Is that love?
Tom and Mary talked all afternoon.
I'm a city dweller.
The problem is that we don't have a lot of money.
Sit at the table.
Did anybody see you?
Are we going far?
I wish I had a room of my own.
I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope.
Tom and Mary often sing together.
I just found it.
We have a visitor right now. Would you mind waiting for a while?
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
Tom began hesitantly.
Tom rolled up his pant legs so people could see his bright red socks.
I know who the killer is.
"Thank you for this, Tom."
Forget about that right now.
He sent me a letter asking if the book had reached me.
You have to tell me the truth.
People like Tom lie all the time.
Aren't you supposed to be at work right now?
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Who did you get this from?
All the stores were closed.
I'll sleep when I'm dead.
Tom was getting impatient.
"They, too, were out of money."
I'll try to say it in French.
All of my brothers have jobs.
You're in the right place.
The bridge is under construction.
Tom is annoyed.
Tom said that he'd never planned on staying that long.
Someone is knocking on the door.
He took the trouble to assist the poor man.
Tom seldom wins arguments.
Could you please tell Tom that I need his help?
Both sisters are blondes.
I feel like eating out tonight.
I can't give it to Tom.
I don't know what Tom will think.
Shall I check the oil?
I don't trust you anymore.
I turned on the radio to listen to the news.
Are you a criminal?
How long will the storm last?
I have told you everything I know about Germany.
It is not until we lose our health that we appreciate its value.
Are you coming to the store with me?
You're modest.
Tom seems fussy.
I don't think Tom was involved in the scandal.
This machine is worthless.
Tom says he's on his way back home.
He accomplished his mission.
Tom brought his son to work.
Can I ask you something very personal?
I've already been working here for several hours.
Bunk beds are a way to save space.
Tom and Mary named their daughter Alice.
I like both.
I should've become a teacher.
"If anyone can do that, it's Tom."
I don't remember her name.
I just need some rest.
Are you suggesting it's a design flaw?
You should always keep your room clean.
Can you please tell me what time the train leaves?
He can't cook very well.
Gusty winds are making travel hazardous for high profile vehicles.
Do you want to do it with me?
I didn't know Tom very well.
She waited for hours and hours.
Who's on duty today?
Why are you asking me?
Are those the people you saw yesterday?
We can see Mt. Fuji over there.
Tom accepted Mary's gift.
I'm playing with my cat.
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.
I don't know any French songs.
"Tom came into the living room, not wearing any pants."
I bought this shirt yesterday.
"Tom is your son, not mine."
Are you free now?
Tom is a good dancer.
These are beautiful flowers.
Most Japanese eat rice at least once a day.
We know where it is.
"Since I was cold, I put on my coat."
His salary is double what it was seven years ago.
Tom sells cars.
She tried to persuade him not to decline the offer.
Tom poured himself some milk.
I often eat breakfast here.
"I'm putting myself through school, so I can't have things that are that expensive."
We have to get back before Tom does.
"Tom, get us out of here!"
Tom has gone to Boston on business.
How many shots did you hear?
Don't rip me off!
Somebody opened the door.
How can I start the engine?
Do you feel guilty?
We've got to tell Tom.
I don't know what to do right now.
"At first, I didn't know what to do."
I would highly recommend it.
Please don't lie to me.
This is by far the better of the two.
Do you follow?
Do you know where Tom is?
How hot is it?
How do you pronounce that?
Her fiancé gave her a very big ring.
Are you saying you don't like it?
I look forward to the summer vacation.
This is one of my favorite quotes.
Do you know Tom's blood type?
This is quite difficult for Tom.
He made his way to the minister.
You must have been surprised to meet me in such a place the other day.
There is a rumor about that he is going to resign.
I'm not going out.
We're now about a hundred miles away from Boston.
I don't hate him.
How are you going?
He has a large staff working for him.
Do you drink coffee every day?
You've known Tom a lot longer than I have.
Tom is schizophrenic.
I almost won.
I asked myself that same question.
We saw everything.
That's my dog.
We feel for your loss.
You're not a child anymore.
Tom forgives you.
I'm not taking any chances.
Tom won't go alone.
Tom is my boy.
She always stood by me.
Tom lost his house key.
The storm let up.
Check that.
Keep your door locked and don't let anyone in.
This is the house that he lives in.
Was it really worth it?
Tom earned some money by mowing lawns.
This is the best method to solve that problem.
Tom has been playing games with Mary all afternoon.
She has a bike.
They have twin daughters.
"The police spent hours searching Tom's place, but they couldn't find the murder weapon."
What's it about?
Tom smiled admiringly.
What country are you from?
I wish people wouldn't do that.
Tom wiped his glasses.
I have no intention of ever coming back here again.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
There must be a misunderstanding.
I think you've been lied to.
The Greens are against everything.
Why are you always the one deciding everything for us?
Nobody can do it as well as Tom can.
Do Tom and Mary get along?
Will you drive me home?
Were you able to solve the problem?
I go to bed at eleven.
I don't need your protection.
I stayed in Japan only a few months.
They are my sisters.
A bead of sweat started forming on his brow.
Have you ever been arrested?
"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
I can do it without you.
Did you know Tom used to be a French teacher?
Tom felt dizzy from the heat.
That's why Tom got up early.
Where is Tom going to go?
Tom has requested our help.
Very few people know it.
You can't outrun that bear.
Parents teach their children that it's wrong to lie.
Tom said good night to Mary and left.
Tom thinks that his life is boring.
Don't force me do that again.
I asked Tom to open the door.
When did you buy this car?
She looked up at the ceiling.
His house is three times larger than mine.
Keep your voice down.
Tom and the others left early.
It seemed too good to be true.
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.
She is always busy.
I wanted to sell it.
She earns half as much money as her husband.
Tom was asleep.
Your selfishness will lose you your friends.
Do you often travel abroad?
My room is number fourteen on the third floor.
That's not very good.
I need you to drive me to the station.
I like sports.
Tom had a heart attack while shoveling snow.
Nice to see you.
I can sing.
Tom had a beer.
Answer the phone.
She has a picture.
There were enough seats for all of us.
"This is a meeting room, not a waiting room."
Traveling was much more difficult in those days.
Will you stay at home tonight?
The streets are dangerous at night.
I sometimes visit my friends' homes.
They'll be OK.
The door will not open.
Is this your bicycle?
All my friends turned their back on me.
She is smarter than he is.
Tom was the star of the show.
They love me.
I washed my T-shirt.
His briefcase was filled with water.

Look at the blackboard.
It depends on the size of the chair.

These cars are big.
What're you looking for?
Canada is to the north of the United States.
He is cranky.
Do you have a phone?
Keep doing what you're doing.
Tom handed his son a lollipop.
It's hard to get people to change.
I want to arrive at Kennedy Airport early in the afternoon.
I would go to the library if I had a car to get there.
"One lump of sugar, please."
It was said that that lady was an actress.
He is very stingy with his money.
I told you Tom was busy.
"I have an income of 50,000 yen a month."
How do they look?
"I don't know why, but I'm sure that Tom has his reasons for not hiring Mary."
Hardly anybody's happy today.
It'll take two hours to get there by bus.
Tom says he's not going.
"If I don't do it now, I never will."
It's moist and warm.
How long do I have?
They're washing their hands.
It's only a temporary solution.
You don't know what Tom is like.
They sell meat at this store.
She slapped his face.
Tom is a pilot.
I want to eat something sweet.
The pencil I lost yesterday was an old one.
He made mistake after mistake.
Aren't you just a little bit curious?
I'll be fine.
Keep looking.
The medicine had a wonderful effect on him.
Consider it done.
Tom and Mary haven't heard from John in a long time.
That's not good.
Put down your pencil and listen to me.
You would do well to tell it to him in advance.
We'll soon know the truth.
I will pick you up after work.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
I think that's where Tom is now.
We also went to the temple.
"She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are."
Everybody's tired.
Tom moved over so that Mary could sit next to him.
The problem is that my son doesn't want to go to school.
"We have a lot of things do to. ""Such as?"""
Let's take a taxi.
I study Chinese and Spanish.
You have to be prepared for anything.
"In the year 2012, there will be flying cars everywhere."

Tom did it for money.
I heard that you helped Tom find a job.
My sister goes to the Carpathians every year.
You will be able to sing better next time.
I'm tired of waiting in line.
I acted as interpreter at the meeting.
Mary and some other women were here for a few hours.
Tom will become a good soccer player some day.
She gets lost really easily. She's got no sense of direction.
"If you are not satisfied with your share, I'll make it a bit more attractive."
I wonder how Tom does that.
What was your mother doing when you got home?
It's a riveting story.
Tom is enraged.
I am out of work.
What's the name of the ship you served on?
Two students are absent today.
It's not safe to text while you drive.
Tom carefully cut the fabric with a pair of scissors.
What happened was out of my control.
I'd like to be a teacher.
What do you think she is going to do?
Tom did it for the sake of his country.
I have a lot of old books. A couple of them are quite valuable.
I am looking for an assistant.
The three of them all just looked at Tom.
Tom looked hurt.
I'd like you to meet my sister.
"Give me the salt, please."
One of us is wrong.
What is a UFO?
They burst into tears.
Tom and Mary were too tired to fight.
Did he get married when he was in Germany?
I'm sure he'll pass the upcoming exam.
"If you don't leave, I'm calling the cops."
The way you're doing it is wrong.
The mailman left a letter for her.
May I have a bus schedule?
What month is this?
Tom has been gone for a few days.
I have a friend living in Boston.
I have the feeling that my French isn't improving much.
We're going hunting.
Tom drank a lot of vodka on his trip to Russia.
Tom put a Band-Aid over his small tattoo of a spider so he would be allowed into a Japanese hot spring.
We've got to start doing that.
It is cloudy today.
It's about time.
Are you mad?
This isn't worth it.
The paint on the door is not dry yet.
Tom and I get along fine.
I am digging a well.
"If you have finished reading the book, return it to the library."
Tom doesn't like Mary.
Tom slammed the door in my face.
I'll show that to Tom.
Put this Japanese into English.
Everybody cries sometimes.
Tom said that he wished he hadn't told Mary to try to convince John to do that.
I think Tom misses you.
She looked at me with tears running down her cheeks.
He excels in many sports.
Do you think you'd have time to help me learn French?
Don't blame the messenger.
I'm really worried that my parents aren't going to like Tom.
Tom came here.
It cannot be helped.
Did he say something?
You're going to be in trouble and it's my fault.
Don't waste your time on trifles.
I'll do whatever you ask.
He was sitting and reading a book.
"Could you call me tonight, please?"
You're in luck.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom has already left for work.
You're not allowed to park there.
"This isn't for you, Tom."
Am I on the right road?
I always wondered what that noise was.
I guess that you can't do it.
Tom is milking the cow.
I like reading Tom's blog.
Tom must consider carefully whether he really wants a divorce or not.
I heard you scream.
"Sooner or later, he will master French."
We are going to have a storm.
We couldn't row against the strong current.
Could you reduce the price a little?
Let me fix the switch.
What's up there?
Put it on.
I fear nothing.
Tom knows how to fly a helicopter.
I used to think it didn't really matter what I fed my dog.
He lost his way in the woods.
A person is known by the company he keeps.
We've got to catch the lion alive.
Can you pay me in advance?
Are you envious?
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
We learn a good deal at school.
She almost froze to death in the snow.
Are you the new teacher?
What do you have on for tomorrow night?
You can't deny that.
I almost dropped my sandwich.
It's not from me.
I want to know what you think.
Shut up and watch the movie.
Tom knew that I was sad.
Why don't you stop?
There's no smoke without fire.
Do you want me to make coffee?
Not everybody is the same.
"Since the light in his room is on, he must have come home."
Tom doesn't shave.
That is her house.
I've done the right thing.
I'll go home and get it.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom was ruined.
What is the matter with you?
Tom screamed for help.
The new bank is on Baker Street.
I don't like stubborn people.
I've never seen such a scatterbrain.
"We have everything we need: money, time, and brains."
"I want to be your ally, not your enemy."
Don't leave them alone.
What is the best way to learn English?
This was no accident.
My watch may be one or two minutes fast.
Please tell me how I can get in touch with him.
Tom filled the box with food.
It's a very difficult tongue-twister.
Tom asked if there were any questions.
Tom should come.
I'm not sure that I can swim that far.
The room is at the end of the hall.
When does the movie start?
You should know it.
The blue roses are very beautiful.
You're not safe here.
I study Chinese in Beijing.
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
Tom is the boy on the right.
Tom is very unfriendly.
It's only a small house but it meets my needs perfectly.
I don't think you'd like that.
He spoke for ten minutes without a pause.
Are you certain about this?
He's good at cards.
Do you really believe that Tom is reliable?
Can I turn off the TV?
I don't have the authority to give you the green light.
You're still young.
Have you been to London?
"Who helped you? ""Tom did."""
Tom is better off than he used to be.
I should've reacted differently.
I don't have to work on Monday.
I am proud to work with you.
I tore up the contract.
What places does that tour visit?
I drink wine every day.
Tom says that he doesn't feel like drinking beer tonight.
We will move into our new house next month if it is completed by then.
We're just doing our job.
There was blood everywhere.
Tom has been trying to get in touch with you.
I thought about you the other day.
"A little louder, please."
Thank you for listening.
It goes without saying that smoking is bad for the health.
"At last, we were home!"
I hope you can forgive me.
"If the shop is closed today, I'll try again tomorrow."
"If you don't want to stay alone, I can keep you company."
I do not like mathematics very much.
Tom doesn't know whether it's true or not.
Tom declined Mary's offer.
It's really windy today.
We can see the island in the distance.
Tom's family is rich.
This telescope must be used carefully.
Wait in the waiting room.
I'd like to be with Tom.
I don't want to get up.
I want to congratulate you on your graduation.
You may go anywhere you like.
It's all over.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
Are you a student here?
There is an apple under the desk.
The cat ate the mouse.
Tom has a hangover.
How did you get down here?
They're having extreme money problems.
Tom has many cats.
"His car isn't here, so he must have gone."
It's so hot outside that I want to spend all day in my air conditioned house.
You have to leave Boston.
I don't want you to quit because of me.
I came with Tom.
Do you want me to call an ambulance?
Are we sure about this?
Didn't your parents give you anything?
Tom isn't good at sports.
"In case of an emergency, dial 110."
Tom showed up at about 2:30.
Tom wanted a new car.
We came here to enjoy ourselves.
Tom knows how you feel.
Tom is from a rich Boston family.
"At first, I was disappointed."
I can't be fired. I'm the boss's son.
The cat woke up.
He made believe he was a doctor.
Could you please wait a minute?
Are you on your way home?
Tom and Mary now live in Boston.
I've worn out my shoes.
Seals eat fish.
I'm next.
They're impressed.
Why do you want one of those?
That belongs to me.
Tom may know where Mary is.
"What's happened, has happened. It's history."
There's a nice Thai restaurant near here.
She went to the park with him.
Why are you getting upset?
Would you be interested in coming with us?
Raise your hand if you have a question.
Do any of your friends play guitar?
I lost a lot of blood.
It's kind of you to drive me home.
Tom shot at Mary with a crossbow.
What have you been doing all week?
What language do you use when you talk with your parents?
It is five minutes to nine.
He is not to be trifled with.
Tom has been hiding in the basement.
He was first elected to the Senate in 1984.
He did what I wanted right away.
I bet you're hungry.
I am beginning to remember it.
Tom had expected something quite different.
"There is little, if any, hope of his being alive."
We have a good life together.
She takes after her father.
I started a new blog. I'll do my best to keep it going.
The monkey got away.
I promise I'll try.
Look closely.
I need to ask you some questions.
"Come on, touch it."
It's time to resolve this question once and for all.
I'm not what I used to be.
No one could've predicted this.
Does Tom know about Mary?
The neighbors' son won the spelling bee at school.
This is unacceptable to me.
We were clueless.
Tom has read a lot of French books.
Tom is doing that.
I'll leave it up to your imagination.
This sentence can be interpreted in two ways.
What part of Australia are you from?
Tom cried his eyes out.
Live and learn.
I think Tom is impolite.
Strange things tend to happen here.
I wish you wouldn't go.
Let's discuss your idea.
The plane arrived on time.
Lightning can be dangerous.
"I've heard of him, but I don't know him personally."
"Tom, will you stop that?"
He has two Picassos.
Is that not enough?
He lost everything.
Tom is back to square one.
Could you please overlook it this time?
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
She may be a nurse. I am not sure.
They never tell a lie.
Tom looked very good.
It was kind of you to help me.
Tom suggested that they convert the old church into a concert hall.
Tom mentioned that it was about time to leave.
Tom and Mary were smiling at each other.
She was injured in the car accident.
It was never my intention to hurt you.
I weigh 130 pounds.
Why are you so hard-headed?
I'd like to come to see the doctor as soon as possible.
I am sure everything will turn out all right in the end.
I've studied Japanese for five years.
The trouble is that I don't have much money now.
It's not an issue.
Tom said he thought that the statue weighed about 300 pounds.
Give me some time to figure out what went wrong.
Tom uploaded a video on YouTube.
He spends his evenings in front of his laptop.
It's harder than you think.
"Finally, on January eighth, the British attacked."
Not all children like apples.
I need to rest a moment.
He'll win for sure.
Tom worked all day and was completely worn out.
Do they have a computer?
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
"Even though he has turned twenty, he's still too timid to chat with girls."
Tom gave Mary the wrong book deliberately.
Tom walked to the store to buy some milk.
She has been studying French for a few years.
Tom is imitating the teacher.
Tom has a lot of money now.
Tom found it difficult to solve the problem.
I forgot our anniversary.
We don't get out much.
It's in the fridge.
I got a letter from her.
This is not how I wanted this to end.
I make 100 euros per day.
This is the church where we got married.
"You want to see a French movie, right?"
He was born in Switzerland.
I don't have any rooms for rent.
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
Tom is busy now.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
When did you marry your wife?
No one was punished for the fiasco.
It's not like that.
Tom seems interested in nothing else.
Have you asked the others?
I told Tom not to worry.
Stop teasing your sister!
Tom loves to climb mountains.
They all looked up.
"If you don't want to do it, you don't have to."
I want Tom out of here.
Tom would treat you with respect.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.
I don't have time to relax.
Tom put all his eggs in one basket.
Tom realized that he had fallen in love with Mary.
Don't give in to peer pressure.
I made the first move.
I thought you'd never visit us again.
It is difficult to talk to him.
She shivered at the sight.
Tom is hard to deal with.
I wondered why Tom was absent from school.
How many people are you expecting?
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
I almost stepped on a skunk last night.
Everyone hates me.
I thought Tom wanted to marry you.
Mexico has half as many people as Japan.
I want to tell you one thing more.
Tom is responding well to the treatment.
Did Tom say what the meeting would be about?
You're no younger than I am.
Let a porter carry your baggage.
What are you trying to hide?
I called you this afternoon.
Tom and Mary rented a room in one of Boston's most luxurious hotels.
Tom won't stop you.
Are you on the committee?
They enjoy one another's company.
The town fell into ruin.
Tom stroked his beard.
You should come with us.
Do you still play hockey?
There are more important things in life.
I got a new camera.
Please don't make so much noise.
"When angry, count to ten before you speak."
Tom failed to pass the final exam.
Tom is not as old as you.
I'm in my apartment.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
My mother often suffers from headaches.
I know you know this.
Tom usually eats his lunch alone.
Is that a no?
They thought it would be too expensive to build a factory here.
Give this book to whoever wants it.
Tom had to get up at 6:30 every day.
Businessmen could not pay back money they owed the banks.
There's a good restaurant not too far from here.
This hotel belongs to my brother-in-law.
Give my regards to Tom.
That's the most important reason.
"One of the twins is alive, but the other is dead."
Many Americans welcomed the plan.
He's a weak-willed man.
I have been loved.
Mary wore a silk blouse.
The cars crashed into each other.
The experiment has to begin.
They have to fix the water pipe. It's clogged.
Just call me Tom.
I believe you have information that can help us.
When did you come to Japan?
I like playing tennis and golf.
They burned.
My lips are sealed.
The maid will clean the guest room.
It takes three hours to get to Boston from here.

I already tried that.
How many times will you have to go to the dentist?
You need this.

Start here.
What's your opinion on that?

We found only a small number of customers in the store.
There is one thing I want to ask.
Tom is spreading butter on the bread.
You can use this car.

Are we prepared?
What makes you think that Tom's interested in helping us?
We went to the same church.
I'll arrive on October twentieth.

I ran in order to be on time.
Do you want a bite?

You'll go to school tomorrow.
Mary was impressed by the big organ in the church.
I'll never leave you.
Did Tom tell you?
"Since there are rice paddies near my house, I often hear frogs croaking all night long this time of year."
Here. Take this with you. It might come in handy.
We're going home by car.
You should take a vacation.

Please write down everything I say.
Tom respects you.
I always thought Tom was a complete idiot.
This is the worst day of my life.
I'm scared.
Bad people aren't born bad.
It is pitch dark.
I liked Tom better before he got married.
I was humiliated.
Do you like cats?
You cannot take back what you have said.
He put his thoughts on paper.
Tom said goodnight to Mary.
Try harder.

Come and help us.
Please stop laughing.

I only met Tom twice.
The painting is all but finished.
Tom kissed Mary while John and Alice were looking the other way.
The lid is closed.
They say he's sick.
We're not going to stop here.

Tom is knocking.
I'm not going to be able to do that.
I can't stand this hot weather.
I traveled by myself.

Tom felt both betrayed and humiliated.
I'd like to find a French-speaking doctor.
Tom is the father of three children.
That intrigued everybody.
We go fishing together once in a while.
Stop it. You're being ridiculous.
Tom and Mary got married and settled in Australia.
Life is a dream.
I'm very proud of it.
"I heard that, but I didn't know it was true."
Please don't go.
Tom pushed the clutch pedal down with his left foot.
Get out of my bed.
"Tom pulled out his keys, but then noticed that the door had already been unlocked."
Tom likes living in Boston.
There is a monster under my bed.
Take mine.
Please follow the school rules.
Tom isn't there.
The buying and selling of peoples' personal information is becoming a big issue.
Tom came on his own.
I don't have enough money.
The police detective didn't believe Tom's story.
His temperature is normal.
He called up his uncle as soon as he got to Matsuyama.
Do you love him too?
Tom lost most of his belongings in the fire.
Her health has been declining these past months.
I can't eat meat.
I don't care what people say.
This blue sweater is very pretty.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
The bridge was washed away by the flood.
Stop fooling around!
Please take off your hat.
I'm trying to cheer you up.
I make it a rule to take a walk around the nearby pond in the evening.
You owe me an explanation.
I don't know whether Tom will come or not.
Chairs and tables were damaged.
He grew a beard while he was on holiday.
She knows what you did.
That was an awful day.
You're aggressive.
My sister often takes care of the baby.
My apartment is a mess.
Don't accept drinks from strangers.
I can hardly understand you.
He said that I must go there.
Bring an umbrella because it is expected to rain this afternoon.
May I use your telephone?
We drove through unfamiliar territory.
What did you bring?
I can understand this problem to some extent.
Did Tom die in that accident?
Tom was home alone.
What's it we're waiting for?
Tom asked if what Mary said was true.
The king oppressed his people.
Mathematics is her weak point.
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
Tom looked at me like I was crazy.
I poured myself a cup of coffee.
He believes that there is a spy among us.
It's not going to be that easy.
I have been on a diet for two weeks.
It looks like you've got a green thumb.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
He was first elected to Congress in 1948.
They set fire to houses and farm buildings.
What keeps you up so late?
He tried to put the fragments of a broken vase together.
This is the biggest fish that I have ever caught.
A convict has escaped from prison.
They don't understand me when I speak French.
How are you not seeing that?
It is very hot at night.
He's a quite humble man in spite of all he's achieved.
My French teacher isn't a Canadian.
Don't look so sad.
Getting into a hot spring at Norikura is great.
Tom made this mistake intentionally.
My elbow still hurts.
You shouldn't associate with men like that.
"Tom sat in his rocking chair, reading a novel."
The boy who is playing guitar is my brother.
"You have a thing for Mary, don't you?"
We've got everything under control.
He went on reading the book as if nothing had happened.
Fix this.
Deal with it!
Maybe you should turn off the television and do something else.
That isn't enough.
Tell me where you plan to go for your summer vacation.
I am interested in swimming.
We are hungry.
She will be back before long.
There is little food in the refrigerator.
Tom was devastated.
Why are you learning a foreign language?
I know you're not planning on staying here for a long time.
It looks like we both had the same idea.
One of them even spoke to us.
I'll give you my car.
I'm afraid you're right.
Did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters?
She said she was happy.
I go to church.
Let go of my arm!
Tom says it's an emergency.
There is no sense in your worrying about your health so much.
It looks like today is not my lucky day.
Tom has been waiting for more than three hours.
Did you see the solar eclipse yesterday?
I'm waiting for a phone call.
My uncle is rich.
Mary wrote her number on a piece of paper and handed it to Tom.
It's hidden under the bed.
Her behavior isn't normal for a young girl.
Tom left everything to his three grandsons.
I'll be thinking of you today.
I don't want to make you angry.
I've decided to go by train.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
We must get together for a drink some time.
He's accustomed to traveling.
Do you think you could teach me to play the bagpipes?
Did anyone tell Tom?
Tom was addicted.
They don't have to know.
Are you feeling under the weather?
I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home.
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
He opposed the plan.
When can I visit you?
Tom helped Mary with her homework.
I don't think this city is as safe as it used to be.
They are both very excited.
We have been up all night.
It's well past Tom's bedtime.
Don't hurt him.
We don't want to scare the children away.
What's going on with Tom?
Do you have any family in Germany?
I don't have to do that.
It turned out to be a lovely day.
Tom is hyperactive.
The door creaked.
I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find out who hacked into our system.
I think it's time for me to stop allowing her to always have her own way.
That woman has two bags.
I will help you.
They're waiting for you.
I will wait here until he comes back.
Tom dreamed of being a hero.
We can't let anybody else die.
We should know the result by Thursday.
I want to do something with my life.
I want to drink something cold.
Tom promised not to tell Mary anything.
He abandoned his family.
Tom looks like he got dressed in the dark this morning.
I have just had one of the worst days of my life.
Tom never came.
Let's sit outside.
Why did you lend money to someone like him?
I was really pleased.
Do you drink coffee?
What're you doing there?
Tom isn't capable of doing it.
I knew what had happened.
I'm not giving up.
I'd like to go but I just don't have the time.
They concluded that he had told a lie.
I come from Boston.
Tom decided to ask for Mary's help.
When have you ever done anything for me?
Tom thinks I'm crazy.
Tom is inspired.
I don't have any other option.
Tom can keep a secret.
It was nice meeting you here.
I have black eyes.
Did she write in her diary yesterday?
I have nothing to hide.
He extended his right arm.
My opinion is entirely different from yours.
Do you have a pencil?
She looked well when I last saw her.
It looks like I messed up.
I think it's time for me to leave for school.
Pick me up at 2:30.
We study many subjects in high school.
Who's the little guy?
Tom doesn't have to do that now.
France and Britain were at war once again.
It's thirty degrees below zero.
Is this umbrella yours?
It's half past eight.
You should look after the children from time to time.
He solved the problem by himself.
Tom and Mary stayed behind.
They abandoned the hill to enemy forces.
We'll show Tom.
It was hilarious.
Put the car into the garage.
Don't make a scene.
I am not particularly fond of Shaw's plays.
Can you draw me a map of your street?
This makes us stronger.
I'm not sure Tom is going to survive.
Does he have many books?
Will the coffee stain ruin the carpet?
"I can hear you, but I can't see you."
I don't think I want that.
Keep in mind that you must die.
We met last night.
"Tom sat in an armchair, reading a book."
Germany is one of the largest cheese producers in the world.
He severely criticized the mayor.
Tom was hurt pretty bad.
I think they know you.
She has no one to talk to.
I have a nasty feeling something's gone wrong.
Could you help us after school?
What's your philosophy?
I'll write to Tom again.
How did you know my name?
Are you surprised that I came?
I have already eaten lunch.
She is used to staying up late.
German is not an easy language.
That's what we think.
"I lost my way and, what was worse, it began to rain."
He wore old shoes.
Nobody's perfect.
I tried to help him.
"A man shouted something, waving his hand."
We were all running short of money then.
Tom knows how to ride a horse.
"Luckily, it worked."
There seems to be only one way out of here.
Give Tom what he wants.
"This time, you've crossed the line!"
The sisters hate each other.
I can't remember what Tom looks like.
You must apologize to Tom.
Tom was almost run over by a dump truck.
Have you heard anything from Tom?
I have one.
I'm on cloud nine.
I think everybody's here.
"When he retired, his son took over his business."
My son will take over the job.
He is young and immature.
Make this sentence a little shorter.
Something very strange happened in Salvador city.
Tom's reaction was the opposite of what Mary had expected.
I enjoyed talking with you.
You should take your umbrella with you in case it rains.
Tom's parents often fight.
We all need to learn to deal with this situation.
Don't tell Tom anything.
Do you see people in the park?
Tom scolded Mary for not calling to say she'd be late.
Be careful. Don't throw away those papers.
Tom has to come to Boston.
Tom stuck around.
He cannot answer their questions.
Aren't you even curious?
I was about to leave my house when she called.
I don't remember inviting you here.
The American boy spoke broken Japanese.
We study French at school.
Putting ideas into practice is difficult.
You'd like it.
Where's your school?
"Since their conversation was in French, I couldn't understand a word."
Tom is drenched.
Life is like a journey.
When was the last time I visited you?
We can't go on like this.
It's my only hope.
He stood behind me.
Tom seems like a very capable man.
Can you play the violin?
Tom drove Mary all over the place.
Tom is starving.
"Since the sun had set, we all headed home."
People are playing near the beach.
Stars can be seen at night.
Tom had difficulty learning French.
I am an English teacher.
I am afraid your plan will not work.
I forget your phone number.
This is the house where I used to live when I was young.
I usually do my shopping at this supermarket.
He looks confused.
Let me go in place of him.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Tom is also an artist.
We elected Tom captain of the team.
Let's play ball.
Tom almost pushed the wrong button.
Don't throw away your chance.
He is now almost as tall as his father is.
Would you like to watch a movie?
I'm thankful to be alive.
I don't like high-heeled shoes.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
I'm not a lawyer.
Tom was Mary's best friend.
It's your only chance.
Tom never was lazy.
It's only me.
My car's in the shop.
This gesture is familiar to young people.
I have almost three thousand dollars in my safe.
Tom has good reflexes.
It's not deep enough.
Think about it.
I'm sure Tom loves you.
I want to make a complaint to the management.
I'll help you as much as I can.
Tom just went inside.
There is a page missing.
Tom caught up with Mary and John.
I'd rather not meet him.
Tom seldom wears a hat.
I canceled my hotel reservation.
This is what I like about you.
Promise me you won't tell Tom.
I saw a bum at the train station.
It's part of my job.
He's getting old.
This dish was recommended by the waiter.
I miss Tom.
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
He scratched his head out of habit.
Tom won't come to today's meeting.
They closed down the ferry service since it was no longer economical.
Answer Tom.
When will we arrive?
It's on me.
Tom couldn't convince Mary.
This airport is easily accessible by bus.
Did Tom yell at you?
You've known Tom longer than any of us.
Who let you in here?
Count the apples in the basket.
Tom looks worried.
Do I look OK?
I was saving this piece of cake for you.
Get away from here.
We need an ambulance.
I'm not here to help you. I'm here to stop you.
Just try it out.
One acquires bad habits very easily.
Tell us how we may help you.
Tom tried to prove Mary's guilt.
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago.
"When I heard that, I put two and two together."
You've got to help me.
She went to Italy to study literature.
This video is boring.
Tom asked Mary how she was doing.
My dream is to become a famous singer.
I can't make it any clearer than that.
The goods arrived undamaged.
I'm tired of working a nine-to-five job.
The civil war in Greece ended.
I didn't do anything illegal.
I won't be a party to this.
Have you got any plans?
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
I didn't expect her to ask me that question.
The car exploded a few moments after the collision.
I hate driving.
You're not ready for this.
Do you have any tattoos?
How much time do you spend on Facebook?
The lady remained silent.
Tom was convicted and sentenced to death.
We finally did it.
I work in a post office during the summer holidays.
Mary showed Tom her wedding ring.
Am I still welcome here?
He made up his mind quickly.
Nobody had any idea what I wanted.
Tom thought he could reach the airport on time if he drove a little over the speed limit.
I don't know what the answer is.
You've got a nerve to say such a thing!
Tom moved to Boston three years ago.
"Could you clear the table, please?"
You should wear your hair down more often. It looks great that way.
This room looks like a pigsty.
I'll give you Dr. Shiegal's telephone number.
You're a very gifted artist.
People here are happy.
Go to your room!
You need to be more careful.
Do you enjoy studying French?
Tom drew a happy face on the cover of his notebook.
"To make a long story short, we married."
Don't stay in the sun too long.
Do you wear glasses?
Sometimes we get lost.
I am just dreaming.
There's a fine line between genius and insanity.
We have nothing against it.
Children need to play.
He is my friend. Do you guys know him?
"If anything happens, let me know."
My parents call me up every day.
"Last winter, I went to Canada to ski."
Tom says he has something to show us.
We miss Tom.
The children were swimming naked.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Are you seeing anybody?
The cost of living is very high in Tokyo.
Your cat is overweight.
You have to answer the question.
Tom is obviously worried.
We can't predict what'll happen.
I'll pick Tom up in an hour.
Why did you only stop the foreigners?
We'll catch Tom.
Do you know who wrote this book?
Tom has three older brothers.
Measure each angle of the triangle.
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
You don't look all that happy.
He is anxious to see you.
Aren't you curious?
I don't think you understand.
Tom is attentive.
I doubt Tom would be that foolish.
You can hire a bicycle by the hour at this shop.
Are you on Facebook?
I could order you to do that.
"You feel lonesome, don't you?"
My computer has frozen.
This doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Shakespeare was a contemporary of Marlowe.
Tom doesn't mind lending Mary money.
Tom lost interest in his job.
I don't like being the one who always has to take out the garbage.
I have practiced piano every day for fifteen years.
It occurred to me that I should not keep it secret.
They don't understand me when I speak French.
"When we landed, we saw our friend on the pier."
Enjoy life while you may.
Our cities create serious pollution problems.
You don't deserve to live.
I wonder if Tom ever cries.
I hope you are not catching a cold.
I've heard that you can kill werewolves by shooting them with silver bullets.
You're unfair.
Did you say thank you?
He didn't want to sell the book.
There's a place I'd like to show you.
Finding time to write a book is not easy.
Tom and I haven't seen each other since college.
Did you just hit Tom?
That's a copy.
It was very hard.
The roof of the house is red.
I do it because I want to.
This is the most fun I've had in my life.
I don't like dogs.
This window won't open. See if you can get it to move.
I can't lie to Tom again.
Tom isn't naive.
It's more common than you think.
I often play soccer after school.
"I wanted to buy the book, but I found I had no more than 200 yen with me."
You haven't changed at all.
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
Tom lost his job.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Tom smelled something.
I've learned a good deal from you.
Nobody knows this.
I assure you we're doing everything we can to find Tom.
Tom is great.
"When you know, let me know."
I have an exam tomorrow.
Don't hide under the bed.
There's something else I want to discuss with you.
Tom threw the ball to Mary.
Having a college degree doesn't guarantee you'll get a job.
He lost his way in the woods.
Tom is always so unpredictable.
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go outside and play.
Where will you stay in Boston?
Is Tom going to be arrested?
I have a serious skin problem.
We lost our way in the woods.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
Your reputation precedes you.
"Clean your room, please."
The bakery is on Pino Street.
My favorite color is blue.
Be careful what you say.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
It's what I would do.
He was absent because of the storm.
We lived from hand to mouth in those days.
What happens if I say no?
What would happen?
Tom was named after his father.
We're not partners.
Looks delicious. Think I'll try some.
You owe me three dollars.
The company is in the red.
Let's get some pictures.
He sent an immediate reply to my telegram.
You're always so worried about what other people think.
He drank a lot yesterday.
I can explain everything.
I want to ask you some questions.
Tom was indignant.
You won't remember a thing.
Don't leave your belongings unattended.
He advanced me a week's wages.
It is Saturday.
I can't even cook an omelet.
I haven't the faintest idea.
We are to meet at the station at nine.
Tom is likable.
I want you to arrange a meeting.
I'm able to swim.
"After the storm, it was calm."
You must record his speech.
Get Tom's advice.
My wife's part-time job brings in a little extra money.
What do you want such an old car for?
Do I really remind you of Tom?
I have been studying English for four years.
Mary is Tom's older sister.
Whatever goes up must come down.
Everybody has weaknesses.
Tom said he didn't know you.
He finished reading the book.
Do you wish to go?
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
"She bought him a dog. However, he was allergic to dogs, so they had to give it away."
What do you say to a beer?
I will take you for a swim.
Tom is pretty good at chess.
Tom is just going to need some time.
What else is there to say?
Today there are many things made of sheet metal.
What more do we need to make us happy?
It's about five miles.
I'm looking for a job.
Does Tom have a hunting license?
I hate fluorescent lighting.
She speaks loudly.
How on earth did you know that?
What is the purpose of your visit?
I'm listening to Björk's latest song.
You're too late.
British English differs from American English in many ways.
Tom's French has gotten better.
He couldn't think where to hide it.
I could have bought that for you.
You may take my word for it.
Give me something to drink.
How long will it take for the mistake to be noticed?
Mary is a wedding planner.
You're sure taking your time.
The first gasoline powered automobile was invented in 1886 by Karl Benz.
Tom is mad at us.
I was just mugged.
Why do you keep bringing that up?
I have to get back to Boston.
Tom is worried about the economy.
I discovered something amazing.
These butterflies are rare in our country.
Tom convinced me that Mary was right.
The Japanese live mainly on rice.
It never happened.
I want you to leave us alone.
"She began writing a report at eight, finishing it at twelve."
My boss has never invited me to her house.
What's your favorite toothpaste?
"When you have a question, ask the teacher."
Money won't be a problem.
Tom left without me.
What are you interested in?
"Tom was busy, so he couldn't help us."
Tell me where the meeting will be held.
What's that you have in your left hand?
She will come back from school by six o'clock.
I can't pay you. Are you still willing to help?
I agreed with her.
I find that pretty interesting.
I asked Tom what he wanted for Christmas.
You haven't answered my question yet.
Tom hasn't finished his lunch yet.
Reindeer are friendly animals.
I have to check my mailbox.
I've got to get back to the meeting.
Tomorrow's weather should be sunny with occasional rain.
The first thing Tom does when he meets a new woman is check to see if she's wearing a wedding ring.
We had a secret meeting.
He showed what he meant.
I was quite surprised.
"When Tom was a child, he went to Boston every summer to stay with his grandparents."
"She's popular, not because she's beautiful, but because she's kind to everyone."
It's obvious that he lied.
See you again tomorrow.
I don't have to listen to you.
It was apparent that there was no way out.
She is seldom at ease with strangers.
Tom didn't get a reply.
"Sometimes, I even impress myself."
Come and see me whenever you want to.
Tom left without saying goodbye.
Tom probably doesn't know who he should ask to help him.
We are living in the age of nuclear power.
Am I older than you?
Hunting is forbidden now.
Every member but me believes what he says.
I thought you'd be in Boston by now.
That sounds exciting.
I'll write to Tom again.
The sheets are clean.
Please answer in French.
My foot's asleep again!
I don't like your hat.
What's the price of this umbrella?
He turned up an hour later.
"In other words, he is lazy."
Doing that won't solve anything.
Tom's eyes are bloodshot.
I don't know what Tom promised.
The concert was a big disappointment.
You should've paid your bills on time.
America is ahead in space technology.
Tom slid down the water slide.
What are these for?
My uncle was the only person injured in the car accident.
Does Tom have long hair?
Do you want some company?
I think it's wrong to tell a lie.
Expectations were low.
I'll take care of your kitten while you're gone.
Why did you write this book?
"Tom, please be careful."
Tom sure talks big.
Tom didn't notice the look of disdain on Mary's face.
May I have this book?
What are you smiling about?
What do you find so interesting about squirrels?
The population of Canada is about 26 million.
"I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I did overhear you."
Nothing's going to happen.
"I'd like to help you, but I'm a bit busy right now."
Tom is writing a book.
Say it again.
We went to see turtles on the beach.
When did you buy it?
It's not easy to translate a poem in a foreign language.
No one has the right to treat you like this.
Can you guess the worth of the diamond?
Why don't you ask your teacher for advice?
When was the last time you saw your boyfriend?
Tom cheated on the history exam.
She's a complete stranger to me.
I love the way you say my name.
Do you want to live in Boston?
I think it's time for me to show you how to do that properly.
I must find Tom.
Everything is ruined because of you.
He is always here between 5 and 6 o'clock.
The market was flooded with foreign goods.
Do you want to do this now?
Tom promised Mary that he'd be home by 5:30.
That's where you're wrong.
The news can't be true.
I have a great memory.
I have never been to the U.S.
Tom was supposed to meet me at 2:30.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
Is somebody there?
I just want you to think about me once in a while.
It's possible Tom and Mary are related.
I thought you were happy here.
Here are the tickets.
"So far, he has been extremely happy."
We had to get something to eat so we stopped at a restaurant near the exit.
The lost child was found after two days.
I need to buy Christmas gifts.
Tom has Alzheimer's.
I kid you not.
I think that games such as Candy Crush are a waste of time.
I don't know how to say what I want to say in French.
Tom knows that we know.
Tom believes he has a very low carbon footprint.
Stand up when I am talking to you.
Tom was sitting in the living room folding laundry.
That's why I came to talk to you.
Have you ever thought of becoming a writer?
Tom showed Mary John's picture.
You're paying.
"We have to tell Tom about that now. ""That's not an option."""
Your birthday is coming soon.
You can't force us to go.
Those books are mine.
I don't think he'll come.
Every student was asked one question.
Tom loved us.
Where do you know him from?
Tom would love to see this.
I'm here to help.
I let you down.
Tom agreed to help Mary find a job.
I know your first name.
Tom is powerful.
Tom failed.
Tom's not here.
Tom wanted to find a doctor who would treat his gunshot wound without reporting it to the police.
Tom seems harmless.
Tom's face is red.
She danced with him.
So where are you guys going?
Can't you do it?
I tried hard.
My sister got engaged.
My grandpa blew out all 97 candles on his birthday cake.
Do whatever you like.
Tom doesn't have a wife.
He will do anything to make money.
I heard what you said to Tom at school.
We have to make up for lost time.
It's a fact you can't deny.
Don't worry. I'll get home safely.
"Without your help, I couldn't have done it."
Show me an example.
I made a big mistake.
Go and have a look.
They insulted him and his wife.
My opinion is different from yours.
Tom had no one to talk to.
I'm not sure who Tom's teacher is.
But you're not there.
It's not that interesting.
Mary batted her eyelashes at Tom.
We're having fun.
I feel relieved.
You can stay only if you're quiet.
I'm not sure yet.
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary.
Are you taking your meds?
I met a friend of Mary's.
Don't worry. It's easy.
That castle was built in ancient times.
You need to do better than that.
I think she probably just thinks of herself as one of the boys.
"What is it that you do, exactly?"
It was impossible for him to solve the problem.
Tom is in the kitchen making tea.
I know Tom.
You can watch television.
I can teach you how to hunt.
So what happened?
Tom woke up at the crack of dawn.
"To tell the truth, I don't really like her."
We live near the border.
That was totally my fault.
What time does she get up?
That happens sometimes.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
You completely ignored me.
We went shopping yesterday.
I read the entire works of Milton over the holiday.
I saw her home.
We'll look for it.
That was quick.
He claimed that the enormous property was at his disposal.
How often do you wash your gym clothes?
He isn't as stupid as he looks.
Tom and Mary seem to be so happy together.

Much better to be woken by the birds than by an alarm.
I found it difficult to put it into practice.
I haven't done this since high school.
Tom jumped on his horse.
I thought a cup of coffee might make you feel better.
There will be no school a week from today.
Ukrainian girls are the most beautiful girls in the world.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
I am laughing at Tom.
Did I interrupt something?
It is still a mystery why she killed herself.
Tom is a very good friend of mine.
I'm as strong as before.
Is tomorrow Saturday?
I don't know where they're from.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I had to go to my office by bus because my car had engine trouble.
The room was in perfect order.
I'm here to save you.
Tom returned the keys to Mary.
I have something in my eye.
She likes to go to the sauna.
We're not surprised.
The boy put his hands in his pockets.
You really look great.
Would you help me for a minute?
I can't keep this up.
Would you like fries with that?
He kept walking back and forth.
Tom was healthy.
Many of the states owed large amounts of money.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
Tom wants to borrow money from me again.
He was busy yesterday afternoon.
Tom said he didn't like the taste of beer.
"You don't know how to speak French very well, do you?"
You mustn't tell anyone.
Take this medicine between meals.
I went fishing last Monday.
It's warm enough to swim.
Why are you wearing gloves?
It was the only way to go.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
Please take good care of yourself.
Do I have to pay in advance?
Could you take me as far as my hotel?
You're a good man.
These are the new ones.
I have not felt well recently.
Your answer is wrong.
The suit's custom-made.
Tom wondered what he was supposed to do.
Everybody knew Tom was in trouble.
I like the way you walk.
I'll come back tomorrow.
I know where you can find Tom.
That's my sister.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Copenhagen is a bike-friendly city.
He wants only the best.
It's certainly a waste of time.
Are you new here?
Your secret will be safe with me.
The young soldier was confused.
"My car is very old, but it still runs fairly well."
Tom doesn't like to ride the subway during rush hour.
The sirens went off.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
"I'll take my passport with me, just in case."
Do you know who you’re talking to?
Don't you think I know?
Tom and Mary have decided not to talk to their children in French anymore.
Tom picked Mary up at the airport.
You need to get out of the house more.
She speaks English really well.
The days are growing longer.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is doing.
The water has been cut off.
I'm not good at French.
Tom likes to be mysterious.
"The sooner, the better."
I was right about Tom.
Tom phoned to say he couldn't come.
Tom fought back.
We don't want that.
Tom doesn't look happy about it.
We can do a lot better.
Take mine.
Nobody was paying attention to her.
The unspoken question is why.
I've always dated older women.
The mother is looking for a babysitter.
You can't keep Tom from going to work tomorrow.
"If it's all the same to you, I think I'll give it a miss."
We don't yet know the side effects of the drug.
Everything depends upon your decision.
What newspaper do you read?
It won't stop bleeding.
"In October, the leaves begin to fall."
Tom drives too fast.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary laughed at him.
I'll postpone my trip to England until it gets warmer.
My schedule is rather tight.
Tom's choking.
Tom took off one of his gloves.
"Tom took another shot at the crow, but missed again."
I found what I was looking for.
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
Come home with me.
All the passengers aboard were killed in the crash.
Did you read it at all?
"I didn't want to sell my car, but I had no choice."
Tom pulled a delicious-looking pizza out of the oven.
A lot's happened while you've been away.
Don't come in here.
Tom walked into the room.
We were certain of winning the game.
I doubt Tom would be that foolish.
It's a worrying matter.
Do you think I'm ugly?
What he needs most is a good job.
He forced me to go.
I want my children to learn to speak French.
She died before I arrived there.
I'm not in a position to give you any advice.
I won't talk to you.
I feel feverish.
"This hall is capable of holding 2,000 people."
It's still too cold to wear shorts.
My grandfather is a bit hard of hearing.
Please shut the door behind you.
Does Tom have to be here?
Tom is well aware of what is going on at the office.
It's fairly warm today.
The post office is down the street. You cannot miss it.
He's a very disagreeable man.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be married.
Do you really want to stay here for a week?
He delivered a speech.
I've decided to major in French in college.
Have a seat.
What's the difference between Cantonese and Mandarin?
Many people think that antique cars are overpriced.
Tom has an American accent.
Is Tom married?
Tom isn't in there.
Tom wants to wait until Mary gets here.
I ate breakfast on my balcony.
I have never met a person like him.
I didn't buy that car.
Do you have a picture?
I've learned a lot from Tom.
Everyone needs to quit whining.
There is a right time for everything.
I didn't recognize the tune.
Tom came to pick me up.
"Turn on the rice cooker, please."
Tom put on his glasses to read the contract.
Cook for me.
The house collapsed a week later.
Tom borrowed money from his family.
"What made him so angry then, I wonder?"
Tom went to Boston to study music.
I can't decide where to eat lunch.
I don't know what I'm going to do next.
Tom and I aren't permitted to do that anymore.
What was Tom's response?
I felt drawn toward her.
"Will you buy me some bread, please?"
Have you tried online dating?
He didn't say in which year he was born.
I'm not kidding.
I thought I was too old.
Both stories are true.
You're kidding!
"Tom, why can't you just accept the facts?"
Who do you think it is?
I'm looking forward to the return of spring.
You look like a cop.
I have so many clothes I don't know what to wear tomorrow.
"Way to go, Tom!"
One hand washes the other.
What have you been up to?
Do you know how to get there?
The tea set isn't complete.
Don't worry about the baby.
I'll talk to Tom.
Get out of my room.
You have nothing to prove to us.
I have a sharp pain here.
We need an interpreter.
You're very attentive.
It's difficult to explain.
I require your assistance.
Tom is the only person who knows about this.
He took out a dollar from his wallet.
Isn't there a better way to do this?
It sounds like a fun job.
I am afraid he won't come.
That's not what I'm here for.
"In 1835, a barrel of flour cost six dollars."
Do you like any of these pictures?
He drank a cup of tea and then asked for another.
The dog is panting.
Help me find Tom.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
I like English better.
Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
That'd be the last thing I want to do.
Tom called Mary up and asked her what her schedule was.
Can you show me how to do that job?
"It's the story of a boy, a girl, and a cat."
The dispute was finally settled.
Please remain seated until the bus comes to a complete stop.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the crash.
Where would you like to sit?
Why can't you just be honest?
Are you out of work?
I saw a strange woman there.
Was it good?
They made me go there.
He left the room.
Will you hand me that pencil?
You don't need to worry about Tom.
I knew the risk.
Tom isn't going to do that.
Are you going to be OK?
"I thought you said Tom lost his job. ""Maybe I was wrong."""
This work is simple enough that even a child can do it.
Tom has trouble keeping up with the rest of the class.
There were toys scattered all over the floor.
She has a son everybody loves.
Tom has a lot of books.
She speaks a little Arabic.
He turned around when I called.
Tom saw Mary on TV.
A change of air will do you a lot of good.
Make sure you have reserved a room at the hotel.
After the calves are weaned they are moved to the plush river-flats for fattening.
Tom knows what Mary wants to do.
Never feed dog food to your cat.
Tom looks serious.
Tom only eats raw food.
Tom is responsible for this accident.
You should ask Tom first.
The lady's funeral was held at the local church.
This doesn't mean the danger has passed.
Don't you miss Tom?
I think we picked the wrong person for the job.
Tom said he didn't want anything to drink.
"Hey, you're not Tom."
The hotel burned down.
I think Tom knows where Mary lives.
The government must make fundamental changes.
Tom can't stand it.
Are we safe in here?
The room was filled with people.
Would you like to eat something?
I'm driving into town so I can drop you off on the way.
You three seem to want something.
You disappointed me.
She was ill for a long time.
We're armed.
"You all remember Tom, don't you?"
Tom is the one who caused the accident.
I have difficulty in French.
I don't like writing.
Who is that young woman?
No one seems to smile anymore.
We had trouble getting into the disco.
You don't seem too happy to see us.
Here's my wallet.
Have you come to save me?
He says it's urgent.
There's nothing you could've done to prevent that from happening.
Would you please leave?
I've already found a volunteer.
Tom isn't good at cooking.
How many close friends do you have?
"You go to school, don't you?"
Would you please come again later?
Tom asked a few good questions.
He drives very fast.
I'm not as smart as you.
She should eat breakfast.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
What do you know about it?
I wonder why Tom needs that.
Aren't you cold out here?
My toy is broken.
I was too tired to go on working.
I've heard that Tom is planning to move to Boston.
Tom goes to school on foot.
What's your blood type?
Did Tom enjoy it?
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
That shouldn't have been allowed.
Why aren't Tom and Mary here?
Tom forced Mary to give him the money.
You're totally useless.
Tom frowned.
What's your favorite brand of soap?
These are decisions I want to make alone.
Boil some water.
I can't remember her name.
He makes it a rule to take a walk every morning.
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.
They wanted to earn money.
Tom is going to make some changes.
We ran out of food.
Forty-eight sailors are on board.
This is not important.
You could've said something.
Tom is helping Mary carry in her suitcases.
The computer that Tom's father gave him when he was thirteen is still working.
We were a little tired.
Let's wait until six o'clock.
Tom is witty.
Everybody should have a purpose.
"Can I have the key now, please?"
I want a family.
He spoke well of her son.
I didn't make the rules.
The chef came over at our table.
We're almost there.
I studied hard in order to pass the examination.
My uncle said that he jogs every morning.
How can it be done?
Do you want to leave?
She didn't know what to do.
It's you who are confused.
His dream came true.
You must have a reason for telling me.
It was a truly superb meal.
"Today it's very sunny, so everyone is wearing sunglasses."
She gave me a dirty look.
She flatly refused to let him in.
You may ask me any question you want.
This toy is almost indestructible.
I think they were all fired.
X rays are used to locate breaks in bones.
Did you get that ticket from Tom?
Will we be the only students taking the exam tomorrow?
What happened to the others?
Could I talk to you alone for a second?
Is the job too much for you?
I want to have this letter translated into English by tomorrow.
Tom said that.
You are very brave.
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
The continent is abundant in fossil fuels.
Tom was carried away by the police.
I like apples.
Tom's hair has turned gray.
This door won't shut.
Your bike is better than mine.
I was at the party.
Do you have an appointment?
Save it till later.
I can't say that I'm surprised.
Do you know whose handwriting this is?
What we need now is new ideas.
Honesty will pay in the long run.
I'll leave this work to you.
I know what you're planning to do.
Beat it.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
Please don't listen to Tom.
The Americans had nothing to do with the matter.
"I owe you 3,000 yen."
Tom always flies economy class to save money.
What do I need?
How long did it take for you to read this book?
Tom can't deny it anymore.
Pay your rent in advance.
This room is cramped.
What's your favorite song on this album?
What's your favorite war movie?
You will succeed in the end.
Reading books is important.
Don't you have a pen?
"Which do you like better, rice or bread?"
Easy does it.
I must have the wrong number.
It was built more than 500 years ago.
We were neighbors.
I imagine that Tom will eventually run out of money and have to go back home.
Where's the boy?
My husband's not in town.
Can you give me the recipe?
What's your favorite cookbook?
Tom wore jeans and a cowboy hat.
You never should've done that.
The best cookies I've ever eaten are the ones that your mother baked for me.
My father used to travel.
I had a cup of coffee at the cafe.
They're a dime a dozen.
I don't owe him anything.
This one is Tom's.
Doesn't Tom want to go with us?
We learned Russian instead of French.
I met him in the crowd.
Tom likes most of his teachers.
What I'm telling you is true.
Tom's sobs could be heard from the next room.
The pond is frozen.
I'd like to put the past behind us.
I bought a red tie.
Would you like a second serving?
"You're on your own, Tom."
I have a feeling you and I have an awful lot in common.
Is your mother at home?
Please call an ambulance.
Have you noticed anything suspicious?
Why did you buy the flowers?
I'd like you to drive.
I remember seeing her.
I can't give it to you.
What have you done with the books?
"You can swim, but I can't."
I don't know what that is.
I want to go to the movies today.
Tom didn't give me details.
Tell Tom which bus to take.
I'll get the others.
Tom hugged Mary and gave her a little kiss on the cheek.
Tom is lifting weights.
He carried a rifle on his shoulder.
She met him on the beach.
We're a little early.
Who's overreacting?
Don't leave the window open.
I just don't love Tom.
Those bananas are delicious.
We have to make sure we get there on time.
I can't believe that you enjoyed that movie.
You don't have enough experience.
Did you kiss anybody?
I saw the man get ganged up on.
I want to go to Seattle.
I regret not having studied harder at school.
We never said goodbye.
I tied everything together.
His room's a mess.
I really like you with a beard.
There were two hundred people in the room.
The law is still in effect.
I learned how to ride a bike when I was six years old.
The birds flew to the south.
This overcoat is inferior to mine in quality.
Tom is beardless.
We'll visit you sometime.
Tom was so confused he didn't know what day it was.
Do you recognize the man in this photo?
This yogurt tastes strange.
"If I had left a little earlier, I would have caught the last train."
Don't dwell on your past failures.
I have more than one friend who can't swim.
The concert will take place next spring.
I may be able to help you.
Can I help you find something?
Kyoto is visited by many people every year.
You're not as good as you think you are.
Tom couldn't put his feelings into words.
Come tomorrow.
Where is the nearest telephone?
You must help us.
Is that car yours?
I can't figure out how to transfer MP3 files from my iPod back to my computer.
Answer me right now.
Do you really need a car?
Where do you want it delivered?
There's a lot of work to do.
He received a good education.
Go and have a look.
The concert was all but over when I arrived.
I will do anything that you ask.
I've worked with Tom a long time.
Do you have a brother?
You must remain calm.
"I'm sorry, did you say something?"
I want you to look for Tom.
Have you paid all the bills?
We're going to have a test today.
I am going to miss you.
I beg you to help me.
Are you planning to help Tom?
I'm not here to make friends.
That is quite possible.
We meant no harm.
I remember the first time I heard this song.
Tom said he wanted to go swimming with us.
Everything was exciting to me when I visited Spain for the first time.
Tom is screaming.
Let's not ever do this again.
I know Tom did it on purpose.
At what rate did the illness spread?
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you.
She was living alone in a hut.
Tell me where you got this.
When exactly did you see Tom?
I only left Tom one message.
Just keep your promise.
I love this company.
He himself did it.
Do you want to resign?
Tom was standing in front of Mary's house.
"It was a fine day, so we went swimming."
There are many people living in this house.
Suzhou is very beautiful.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
Who invented that?
Tom said he was looking for someone who speaks French.
I watched this movie last night and I really liked it.
The customs officials searched the whole ship.
We will only consider placing an order if you reduce the price by 5%.
Tom said he couldn't help Mary.
He knows how to lock this door.
Tom told the children that they could stay in this room as long as they didn't make any noise.
Tom studied hard.
I laughed so hard I cried.
Tom always leaves for school too late.
What should I say to Tom?
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
How did you figure that out?
This hat does match the brown dress.
I need a new computer.
He works long hours.
Tom asked Mary several questions.
Tom grew up in a communist country.
He is the tallest of his class.
They are happy with the result.
Don't say anything that you might regret later.
Moderate exercise will do you good.
Is Tom one of the finalists?
We can't leave Tom here. He won't survive on his own.
Her husband is American.
There was nothing that the doctors could do.
Kinshasa is the capital of Democratic Republic of the Congo.
He bought a small house in Kyoto.
Why are we doing that?
You know that.
Tom is unethical.
Stealing is wrong.
What were you doing out here?
I cannot release that information. It is private.
I'm probably wrong.
How old were you when you learned to tie your own shoes?
Please remain seated until the bus comes to a complete stop.
Are you going to call Tom or do you want me to?
We've done worse.
"You can't give up now, not after all the effort you've put into this."
We don't know what to do.
It's too far away.
He doesn't seem to be heading for the town.
The roof is made of thatch.
We're being watched.
All prices are subject to change.
Tom must be home by now.
Tom hasn't sent the letter yet.
Tom is usually pretty shy.
Tom ran to his car and got in.
We can't afford to waste any more time.
You look fat.
I didn't know when to switch the machine off.
Did you have a favorite book as a child?
"At last, we reached our destination."
It's raining.
The train was delayed on account of snow.
"At that time, Tom was sitting between Mary and John."
Go down this road until you get to a traffic light and then turn left.
They live in the suburbs.
Perhaps Tom left.
He has something to do with the robbery.
I'll make you breakfast.
He plays golf on weekends.
I feel depressed because there are a lot of things I have to do.
Tom had his picture taken with Mt. Fuji in the background.
Tom persuaded Mary to sing a duet with him.
Let go of the bottle.
He accused me of being a liar.
I am a stranger here.
You sure sleep a lot.
The old man was sitting with his arms folded.
There are only 24 hours in a day.
Tom's dog ate the breadcrumbs.
All the old magazines are sold out.
She is a pianist.
She stepped forward to shake his hand.
What would you like to eat for dinner?
My ladder is not broken.
How many times a day do you brush your teeth?
Tom drew a picture of a dolphin.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
Tom had a gun.
She has some beautiful antique furniture.
Do you know how to do this?
Tom still remembers you.
The lady wearing sunglasses seemed very strange.
What did he say?
I'd rather not go home.
She is beginning to play the piano.
Why is it there?
This is the monsoon season.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
He weighs 70 kilos.
Where should we pitch our tent?
I've got to agree with Tom on this one.
Tom became irritated.
I'm looking for someone.
We do what we want to do.
I just can't stand Tom.
Tom watched a Japanese movie with French subtitles.
We can't let Tom out of our sight.
Tom isn't going to understand.
Just check it.
Tom is a bit disoriented.
Let's play cards.
Police shouldn't take bribes.
Tom soon fell asleep.
The road is ten feet in width.
It will be quitting time before you get that done.
Tom didn't think what Mary was wearing was appropriate for the occasion.
It's not your money that I want.
Write your name and address on this envelope.
I go where I want to go.
I feel the same.
When are you moving to your new house?
I'll be present.
I remember having seen her somewhere.
Tom Jackson has been elected mayor.
Why weren't you able to do that?
We need a map.
Could you do that?
Mary has spent thousands of dollars on beauty products over the years.
I have no one to play with.
Deal with it!
Don't tell Tom you're a cop.
The tax increases affected our lives greatly.
He left the room.
Tom was murdered.
You can only use it once.
We're learning Chinese.
Is there an ATM nearby?
We've run out of beer.
Just take my word for it.
"As Tom was doing that, it began to rain."
I thought you'd be interested in this.
Tom never quarrels with his wife in public.
I feel like a kid who suddenly realizes that Santa Claus doesn't exist.
I'll give you another chance if you want it.
"In America, we believe that a lifetime of hard work and responsibility should be rewarded with a shot at a secure, dignified retirement."
"Lake Titicaca, the biggest lake in South America, is in Peru."
I never let anyone else feed my dog.
Promise me you won't to do anything stupid.
That's a good approach.
The river flooded a large area.
Wooden houses catch fire easily.
"Tom has left, but Mary is still here."
We can't tell Tom.
"Bring the book to me, not to Tom."
I didn't realize it was so late.
I don't think they would've done anything.
Tom reminisced about the old days.
I think Tom is conceited.
Tom doesn't teach French anymore.
Did you talk to Tom?
I ran out of money during my stay in India.
Is this mine?
How many games do you have in your collection?
There's no wind today.
We never figured out why.
I'm not interested in modern art.
"OK, I think we can begin."
I was just about to go out when the phone rang.
I have good news for you.
The prime minister paid a formal visit to the White House.
I usually have breakfast at seven.
Tom isn't my assistant.
"You said your name was Tom, didn't you?"
Who will take care of the baby?
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed.
He went home three hours later.
My neck does hurt a little.
Let me see that.
It is raining all the time.
Can you feel the difference?
All five rabbits were eaten by the hungry wolves.
"It feels good, doesn't it?"
Where are the guards?
Who are those children?
The boy I love doesn't love me.
Go upstairs right now and clean your room.
I think nobody has ever done such a thing before.
The planets revolve around the sun.
I'll help you find somewhere to live.
Tom doesn't seem to be interested in making friends.
I know all your secrets.
Tom wished he knew more than one language.
Tom doesn't have enough money.
I've been practicing hard.
Why don't people like me?
I planted roses in the garden.
You can't use that.
Will you accompany me?
Tom realized that Mary might be hungry.
The doctor examined my throat.
Please cancel my order and send confirmation that this has been done.
You lost.
His house was burnt down.
We can't let Tom go.
Do you know Tom's phone number?
That's good to know.
There's been a lot of rain this summer.
"All of a sudden, I felt a sharp pain in my stomach."
Let's play cards instead of watching television.
The living room furniture was modern in style.
I had to stoop to go into the room.
I want to speak German.
Why were you late this morning?
I was surprised at his strong resemblance to his father.
He'll play golf even if it rains.
We climbed up the steep mountain.
Where did you pick up your Italian?
He doesn't even remember what happened last night.
Have you fed the dog yet?
Your arms and legs have grown strong enough.
Who did this first?
This may be of use to you.
Why don't you have some wine?
How lovely!
She always stands up for her convictions.
Tom got Mary to laugh.
This laptop computer is very thin.
Tom speaks French better than he pretends to.
I can't believe you actually said that.
Can I take pictures here?
Each of the boys was eager to join in the race.
"Are you happy? ""Yes, I suppose I am."""
His house is near the subway station.
I haven't said yes yet.
Tom wanted to continue.
You could start your own company.
"You're Canadian, aren't you?"
You can't tell Tom what to do.
Nobody wants you to do this.
You might at least say thank you.
He was English.
I don't understand what you're saying.
You need to stay awake.
How did you get Tom to do that for you?
Tom wants to know when you'll be finished.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
What do you think you're doing?
This river is about one third as long as the Shinano.
Tell me why you think that.
A unicycle has only one wheel.
He's a scriptwriter.
Do you want me to leave?
Tom is too busy to help.
Don't come again.
You can't help what happens.
You didn't have to lie.
Take that one there.
Tom died young.
My goal in life is to be a novelist.
You don't need to stand up.
I don't have the authority to give you the green light.
Tom was lying to you.
Do you know what they said?
Everyone seems to be busy but me.
He hasn't been able to come because he is sick.
We have the same destiny.
This watch is my father's.
Let's not deceive ourselves.
Tom came up with a plan.
Do you recognize it?
I'll forgive Tom.
Is there a supermarket near your home?
Tom asked too many questions.
I wish I could buy that guitar.
Either you or I am wrong.
This poem is attributed to him.
Tom knew this.
Tom didn't answer the phone.
Tom got into a fight with the people who were staring at him.
My neighbor renovated her house completely.
"Just don't do anything stupid, OK?"
I don't think that's a real word.
I'll call you up later.
My grandmother lives by herself.
Perhaps you'd be willing to volunteer to take care of the children.
We worry about your future.
There is nothing God cannot do.
Tom dipped into his savings to buy a house.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 and she wasn't happy about that.
I heard it on the radio.
I'm proud of what you've accomplished.
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
I really thought Tom was happy.
Columbus proved that the world is not flat.
Tom and Mary are eating breakfast.
The elevator doors wouldn't open.
Is this your briefcase?
They're brown.
Is it really worth it?
I'll see to it.
I didn't go.
I have no idea where he lives.
The theater was jam-packed.
I don't think you're being honest.
Tom works too much.
I bought it for ten dollars.
Why don't you go see Tom?
This form must be filled out in triplicate.
Tom ate only one slice of bread.
No one uses that word anymore.
Only you can answer the question.
Tom said he didn't want to go to school today.
She speaks fairly quickly.
You're the one causing all the trouble.
Are you here to arrest me?
We talked to each other in French since we thought people around us wouldn't be able to understand what we were saying.
I'm going to jump.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this matter.
A young child has a small vocabulary.
I can't give up without a fight.
I beg you to forgive me.
It was my fault.
His cottage is on the coast.
She didn't seem interested.
They are both colleagues of mine.
You had better not stay up late.
The meaning of this sentence is obscure.
Nothing happens by chance.
We can't talk here.
Tom was worried.
You don't sound scared.
Tom isn't the only one who thinks that way.
Tom had a tooth pulled out last week.
"In the north, it's cold in the winter."
This is just like old times.
Don't interrupt.
It's raining everywhere.
The tiger cub looked like a large kitten.
I think I'm smart.
I arrived this afternoon.
It doesn't fit.
Tom is the worst student in the class.
What we need is a little more time.
Are you busy?
Tom wanted to know where we were going.
What did you miss?
It smells bad.
"Unfortunately, that rumor is true."
I will tell him about it when he comes next time.
I saw her last week.
Tom was transferred to the head office in Boston.
The boy seems to know a great deal about plants.
Experience counts in this job.
The typhoon hit Tokyo.
Children learn by watching what adults around them do.
Come forward.
Can I touch it?
The typhoon moved in a westerly direction.
Tom asked Mary for help.
Tom and Mary are still bored.
I'm sure Tom won't mind.
Do we have to go now?
I know you and Tom have had some problems.
Tom put his clothes back on.
He could not walk any further.
How much is the bus fare?
"Tom was asleep in bed, snoring slightly."
Why did I get a C?
My dad bought a model plane for me for Christmas.
Tom overstepped his authority.
I was raised on the east side of Boston.
They're going to do it.
Tom always checks the caller ID before he answers his phone.
I didn't see a ghost.
What good's that going to do?
The government has taken measures to promote domestic industry.
It must be done more carefully.
I'll miss Tom.
That's not good for your health.
I'd love to know that.
Tom bought his girlfriend flowers.
It was careless of me to do something like that.
Tom's grades didn't improve.
Tom complained to the teacher.
You've lost a lot of blood.
One should respect one's spouse.
All you have to do is sit here and be quiet.
My brother watches television.
Keep the secret to yourself.
You're kidding!
The lady is over eighty.
I am more beautiful than you.
Computers are complex machines.
A gunshot was heard in the distance.
My bike was stolen yesterday.
That's a wise choice.
I won't be able to visit you tomorrow because I'll be busy.
The crowd cheered.
This building has 5 floors and 20 apartments.
Tom has written a book.
"He said to her under his breath, ""I love you."""
That's a good plan.
You've been spotted.
"Although he was born in England, he speaks English very badly."
I'm expecting Tom.
Can Tom speak French?
Have you ever thought of becoming a writer?
There should be a law against it.
He believes in the existence of ghosts.
Please make a milkshake for me.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
He died yesterday.
His bag was badly damaged.
We don't need to go to school tomorrow.
I must be going deaf.
Here are your keys.
This is out of control.
There she comes.
Tom put away his clothes.
All seats are reserved.
We've never been formally introduced.
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
I'd like you to look at something.
Do you really think that's true?
Show it to me.
I know exactly what you're talking about.
Tom isn't the kind of person who blames others for his mistakes.
This is your problem.
Behave yourself during my absence.
I'm starving!
Living abroad is the best way to learn a foreign language.
I don't know where Tom hid the key.
Tom's passport has been stolen.
We passed through the Panama Canal.
I can teach English.
Do you have enough money for the trip?
Tom can get them.
The coach gave me some advice.
She came hoping to see you.
You can't learn a foreign language in just a couple of weeks.
They had several children.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Do you think Tom is unfriendly?
I misunderstood.
How am I going to protect my children now?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom made it easy for me.
Tom caught the ball.
Why are you being so nice to me?
It's only just the beginning.
That's all the information we need right now.
Where do you write?
Tom doesn't swim so much anymore.
"You know that's where Tom sits, don't you?"
What part of Australia are you from?
Tom hurried out of the classroom.
He put his room in order.
What kind of soup is this?
Tom walked home.
Tom and Mary seem so happy together.
That man was wearing a tiger mask.
You should've told me the truth.
There's no reason both of us need to go to Boston.
Keep the door locked.
Bread and milk are good foods.
The barn is full of farm equipment and tools.
Tom took off his glasses and wiped his eyes.
How do you like my new hat?
She is angry with me.
I stayed home all day.
Tom and Mary stopped talking as soon as John came into the room.
Put the box on the table in the kitchen.
Why are these people here?
I was about to go to bed when he called me up.
I want to take you with me.
Tom is working hard to make up for lost time.
That's as plain as the nose on your face.
No one succeeds in the world without effort.
Don't you recognize them?
We don't want you with us.
He has trouble remembering names.
Just keep moving.
What's your impression of Tom?
Tom bought a used car from a reputable dealership.
Women like men with mustaches.
She didn't want to get involved.
Tom looked tired.
I don't know how to play bridge.
All the seats are reserved.
Tom says he feels a little better.
I'll give Tom a chance.
We're going to begin the descent for Honolulu.
It fits perfectly.
You won’t believe what happened next.
Do you want me to wrap it up as a gift?
Tom gazed at Mary with love in his eyes.
I was just thinking aloud.
Tom made me come here.
Human life is sacred.
Democracy is one form of government.
Why doesn't Tom answer?
Let me get my wallet.
We both know you don't live where you say you do.
We arrived on the island two days later.
Why do you like Tom?
Tom lost his hat.
I'm going to Boston for a conference.
What does Tom do for a living?
I won't go.
Take over.
She behaved quite abominably.
I hope everything will turn out well in the end.
You're confused.
He seems to be wary of us.
Tom is still downstairs.
That was years ago.
We really have no choice.
Tom was a spoiled child.
Tom isn't inside.
They won't start the meeting without us.
We were both hungry.
She cooks for him.
You'd better make sure that it is true.
Tom isn't good at sports.
Tom can't dress himself and he can't feed himself.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
She died in 1960.
I should just tell Tom I made a mistake.
Ten years have gone by since my father died.
"Mary is a very beautiful woman. On a scale of one to ten, she's an eleven."
Tom's greedy.
The plane should have arrived at Kansai Airport by now.
"You know Tom, don't you?"
The committee is discussing social welfare.
He takes a bath every morning.
Tom is improving.
We are going to give a party tomorrow evening.
"When I last saw him, he was wearing a blue shirt and white slacks."
We met earlier.
I like to make faces at Tom.
Don't you see what's happening here?
How long were you there?
Have you ever been to New York?
I'd like one more blanket.
Mary had never worn a kimono before.
Don't touch this!
You should rest.
The summer vacation is over.
I study math as hard as English.
I play in a band.
My brother caught a big fish.
Tom has a broken arm.
"The more I know him, the more I like him."
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
She replied that she had never seen the man before.
Tom didn't want me to kiss him.
There is nothing to apologize for.
It will be dark soon.
She liked to take care of the children.
You'll never be alone.
I certainly don't blame you.
I wondered why people were staring at me.
Tom isn't wearing socks.
Can't you leave me alone?
Would you like for me to do that for you?
I want to leave school.
Tom got on the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor.
Do you want the job or not?
Tom is well aware of the problem.
Can you wiggle your ears?
Tom talked.
He stamped out a fire.
I prefer working to doing nothing.
The train left the station on time.
You ought to have apologized to her.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Do you want the long version or the short version?
I was in the hospital last week.
We were all surprised that Tom won the race.
They sat down.
How's married life?
I have to go back to the office.
"If what Tom told me is true, then we have nothing to worry about."
Tom will check.
I can understand your reluctance.
Tom can't do everything by himself.
Tom was involved in a traffic accident.
"Can you hear me, Tom?"
I'm listening to music.
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
Tom has an uncle who is a banker.
One's new. The other's old.
Who told you I was Canadian?
I don't want to wait that long.
What's your address?
What did they argue about?
I came here to make you an offer.
That sounds like a good idea.
He waved at her.
A boy came running toward me.
Perhaps Tom knows something that we don't.
Our train is late.
He never tells a lie.
You shouldn't count on others for help.
My passport is no longer valid.
You should know that's impossible.
I don't think we need permission to do this.
Tom knew who Mary wanted to go to the dance with.
The bridge will take months longer to build and cost millions of dollars more than first estimated.
You are absolutely right.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
Why are you always taking Tom's side?
The streetlight over there is broken.
You can learn as much in the library as in school.
He stood behind the chair.
Tom tried to discourage Mary from going out with John.
Tom taught me many things.
You've been doing a pretty good job so far.
What should we do with people who are very sick or hurt and can't get better?
This book is designed to teach children how to read.
When's the last time you showered?
I have no money today.
The tines of the fork are bent.
"This book has few, if any, misprints."
We were unable to follow his logic.
William Penn was not born a Quaker.
Shall I cut it in half?
Is it necessary for us to go?
I may have to study French.
What are you doing up there?
You can't just leave me here to die.
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
I've found a job.
"Now that he has gone, we miss him very much."
Tom isn't stoned.
"You are a good cook, aren't you?"
Write in the date yourself.
Why did they fire Tom?
When are you going to come home?
It's not unusual for Tom to go to bed before 9:00.
Tom made a few mistakes on the test.
We looked for her.
I can't seem to get him to fix this machine.
The answer is 42.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
I never thought I'd see you again.
Tom gave up.
I'm glad you talked me into going.
"How do you feel? ""Better."""
Do you work with Tom?
Thank you for giving this to me.
This is theirs.
Go to the doctor to get your prescription!
Did you speak to Tom?
It is believed that whales have their own language.
No one asked you.
I'm not really very thirsty.
"You don't want that, do you?"
We spent most of the evening talking about our vacation.
I have been busy writing a short story.
That kind of story appeals to me.
Are you Chinese or Japanese?
Tom loves fishing.
Here I am.
"If I'd had three dollars more, I could've paid the bill."
I forget your phone number.
Add the vanilla extract.
Do you eat rice every day?
I have done what I could.
It's still snowing.
"If I were you, I would apply for the scholarship."
Tom hasn't shown up at work yet.
What're you going to do?
Thanks for coming with me.
That's the last thing that I expected you to do.
Look up the word in your dictionary.
Tom's a natural when it comes to games involving hand-eye coordination.
Tom said that isn't the only reason.
The pain was unbearable.
There is nothing to be scared of.
The apples are red.
You're cantankerous.
We've already learned a lot.
Are you still living in Boston?
We have no need for assistance.
Tom went to a nearby convenience store to buy something to eat.
Not everyone is happy about this.
I came to tell you that you don't need to worry.
I want people to see it.
They were a match made in heaven.
Maybe we can help Tom.
She traveled by bus.
Tom has no savings.
Tom's novel has been translated into French.
This is by far the best of all.
She liked him right off.
I regret what happened yesterday.
Tom noted in his report that the stock market was a factor in the company's failure.
What do you want with us?
They'll want Tom.
I asked him to open the window.
"I realize that this may sound crazy, but I think I've fallen in love with your younger sister."
You should tell him the truth.
I'd suggest you don't stay longer than absolutely necessary.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
This material will stand up to lots of washings.
We were playing on the beach.
Love is blinding you.
Please don't ask me about this again.
What grade is your sister in?
We enjoyed playing tennis.
You are such a liar.
We're not leaving without you.
The watch on the desk is mine.
I don't have a problem.
I knew that Tom was from Boston.
I can't explain it either.
I'm sure you're aware that you'll be the only one there who can't speak French.
I know you'll be happy here.
Do you know who I am?
I want to be an engineer.
Did you make coffee?
He was getting old.
We have no chance of winning.
I'm getting tired of losing.
The hunter shot the fox dead.
The bride suddenly laughed.
That's our train.
Tom said he'd never been to Boston.
I never wanted all this to happen.
I will ask him about it tomorrow.
The new movie was a big hit.
Your house is big.
The problem is Tom's complete unwillingness to negotiate.
"You live here, don't you?"
Tom refused to work with Mary.
You aren't allowed to do that.
We don't need your money.
It's not quite enough.
I don't like being the one who always has to take out the garbage.
I hope to become a singer.
I wish I could stay with you.
I eat here all the time.
Are you related to Tom?
He ratted us out.
The sun had already set when he got home.
I have a lot of work still outstanding.
She loves children.
Why don't you cut Tom some slack?
They shook hands with each other.
We've already eaten.
This soup tastes good.
We'll go on a picnic next Sunday.
Do you think that that's fair?
I hope you know that.
Do you want to find out?
I've never been to Paris.
Tom has a right to know the truth.
I wish I had more time.
The boss said it's urgent!
How about a song?
I really thought Tom was happy.
Tom realized that he had lost his wallet.
These shoes belong to Tom.
You are a very good artist.
We're out of coffee.
I'm taking Tom home.
You need to reboot your computer.
The teacher warned us that the test would be hard.
Would you like to play tennis on Sunday?
These days I'm very busy.
How long did you sleep last night?
That's news to me.
You'll have to look out for Tom.
My book is here.
"If you are busy, I will help you."
This is incorrect.
I want to play tennis with you someday.
I warned you not to trust me.
It is necessary to lose weight.
Tom couldn't believe that Mary would really do something that dumb.
"You can kill a man, but you can't kill an idea."
"I'm Canadian, too."
She was pleased with the gift.
When did you get home?
"When I got home, I found I had lost my wallet."
I want to study math.
His interests clash with mine.
I don't wear makeup at all.
How would you reword this sentence to make it sound more natural?
I thought I'd never hear from you again.
A Japanese would never do such a thing.
"As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away."
They've got enough to do already.
This book is thick and the other is thin.
I am hungry.
My arm hurts.
I'm so happy.
Promise me you'll never do that again.
Tom didn't help much.
She knows nothing about your family.
Do what he tells you.
"If all goes to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night."
I thought you wanted to wait.
Let's keep quiet.
Are you going to stay there for long?
Please tell me how I can get in touch with him.
He drove down to the hotel.
Would you prefer to speak in French?
You're not going anywhere until your room is clean.
You're uninteresting.
This is the best school in the county.
Watch what you're doing!
That's quite a problem.
Has Tom ever asked you to lie for him?
We'll miss you.
Here's your order.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped to buy a chocolate bar.
Tom was tasered.
Where's Tom hiding?
I want an answer from you ASAP.
The washing machine is a wonderful invention.
I took a wrong turn.
An old person is a bridge between the past and the present.
I dream of seeing him there.
Tom asked Mary if she had been to Boston.
Tom is planting a palm tree in his backyard.
The girl resembles her mother.
What do you expect from us?
"Tom, can you get us some water?"
Let me hear it.
Why didn't I think of that?
Tom wasn't sure if he had enough money.
Swimming is easy.
You should have seen the movie.
Don't forget.
Is there anything you want from the supermarket?
Sumatra is an island.
Tom is in serious trouble.
How long did you stay in Germany?
I have a big brother.
Who is hiding behind the curtain?
She's on a diet.
You can't buy anything interesting in this store.
We want to know.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.
You don't understand.
Tom was surprised that Mary already knew about what happened.
I couldn't sleep.
I am following that car.
Tom didn't know the deadline was today.
"If you don't leave, I'm calling the cops."
Why don't you say something?
Don't ever think that.
Selfie sticks are not allowed in this museum.
I got home at seven.
Where did you have the suit made?
I want to talk with the manager about the schedule.
Tom is rich enough to buy whatever he wants.
I wonder who Tom was talking to.
Tom had never seen Mary so upset before.
I can't stand him.
You're obstinate.
I accept your terms.
I can't tell her from her twin sister.
Tom doesn't always obey his parents.
The station is to the west of the hotel.
The cold climate affected his health.
I can't show you this.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
What's your nickname?
"After eight months, he eventually started dating girls again."
Tom has an eye for detail.
Do you know where I live?
Rest assured that I will do my best.
Everything matters.
We're the only ones here who know French.
Tom doesn't study enough.
"Whose dogs are these? ""They are my neighbor's."""
Tom asked for Mary's address and wrote it down on a piece of scrap paper.
She's dieting.
This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in.
I went to church with him.
"If you don't do that, I won't do that either."
He sent fruits and vegetables to his daughter.
Maybe we should stay right here.
"When you're successful, everyone wants to know you. When you fail, you're on your own."
Tom hasn't changed his mind.
She has been on her own since the age of eighteen.
Do I need to change my diet?
What type of music do you like?
Her bed is next to the wall.
I will do it gladly.
It's all mine.
Philosophy is often regarded as difficult.
It is clear what must be done.
I wasn't mad at Tom.
Mary was arrested for shoplifting.
"Where's your cousin? ""She's just left."""
Did you really think I wouldn't learn the truth?
What did Tom ever do to you?
Have you always wanted to be a police officer?
Tom got engaged.
He didn't tell the truth.
Tom has always kept me informed.
They called them scalawags.
What's your daughter's name?
Tom walks with a limp.
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston.
We are not always at home on Sundays.
The jury found that Samsung had infringed upon Apple's patents.
"I'm from Tokyo, Japan."
That's more than I can handle alone.
What kind of a camera do you have?
The quality of rice is going down.
I am not accustomed to such treatment.
Did you mean this?
She advised him to go by bicycle.
How did you do it without our help?
The barking dog kept Tom awake most of the night.
I understand your anger.
You gave away the ending.
Tom agreed to help us.
I know that you and Tom didn't do that together.
Facebook is blocked in China.
Everything depends on what you will do.
Just leave me alone.
Tom came home drunk from a party.
I think the first thing you might want to do is put some gasoline in your car.
She came all the way from New York to see me.
This is all unnecessary.
That was then and this is now.
Who told you I would help you?
I hadn't expected anyone to be home.
Is anyone else hungry?
I have something to say to all of you.
Tom ordered pizza.
What are you going to do about this?
His brother passed away last month.
Tom isn't wealthy.
Have a drink.
Did you not know that?
Has something changed?
"Hey, I know what I want."
"Does she have a dog? ""No, she doesn't."""
My son can't count yet.
Get started.
Tom said he wouldn't shoot an unarmed man.
You have to follow the rules.
This shirt needs ironing.
That would appear to be correct.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
She is likely to come.
I wanted to learn from the best.
I have to go shopping.
Call me when you're ready.
What do you want to study?
That was enough.
"Tom already had the CD that Mary gave him for his birthday, but he didn't say so."
Tom has more important things to do.
What are my orders?
Where do you want me to put this?
She always finds fault with the way I do things.
"Once and for all, let's get this over with."
Everyone is drunk.
He feels weak after his illness.
They'll come to us.
She has two daughters.
You had better see a doctor at once.
Tom has a very serious drinking problem.
Tom isn't like people say he is.
I want something to write on.
I think it's very difficult for an Englishman to imitate a real American accent.
Tom isn't alone.
We slept in the same room.
"At last, they were reconciled."
Tom has been living in Boston since 2013.
I hope Tom doesn't notice.
I'm sorry to see Tom go.
Teachers should deal fairly with their students.
Don't you like us?
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away.
English and German are two related languages.
No one can help you.
Whose umbrella is this?
Tom lives in the Bible belt.
Go back inside.
You've taught us a great deal.
I really like hard-boiled eggs.
I let the cat in.
It took him ten minutes to solve the problem.
"Because of the bad weather, the plane was delayed three hours."
"Even though he lives next door, he doesn't even say hello to us."
I'm not like Tom.
"I'll do it tomorrow. ""You said that yesterday!"""
Don't die.
I'll keep this cake for myself.
We had no idea what we should do.
"As far as he was concerned, things were going well."
What language do you usually use when talking with Tom?
Why did you go to Boston?
Tom is no expert.
He was ready to face his fate.
You may be needed.
You're welcome to accompany us.
I'm not angry anymore.
I stayed.
Tom treated Mary like a queen.
He waved at her.
I'll love you forever.
We often play chess.
The man is all but dead.
Tom is winning.
I wonder if Tom realizes how many hours a day I work.
I wonder why Tom got mad.
"I don't have a CD player, but I bought the CD anyway."
I'm spending the evening with Tom.
Does Tom want to see me?
"In my opinion, you are wrong."
My brother died of cancer last year.
It'll be difficult to do that.
I'm a musician.
We'll deal with it later.
"Can you repeat that, please?"
Tom is still trying to get Mary to go out with him.
I won't hurt you.
What can you tell us?
Tom can't afford to buy a house.
Tom will respond.
I can be there in ten minutes.
Is it really true?
I don't feed my dog in the morning.
We're out of milk.
She helped her younger brother finish his picture.
Tom has a big problem.
Thank you so much for helping me.
I don't want to talk about school.
City life has advantages and disadvantages.
You lost.
She was brave.
You're the best.
Why aren't you wearing a costume?
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
Tom went over to the window and looked out.
Tom thinks that the world is getting worse all the time.
Tom isn't really in love with Mary.
My daughter loves jumping rope.
Life is tough.
There is an urgent need for money.
I was offered the choice of tea or coffee.
I think I remember how to do that.
It's never too late.
My cousin invited me to her wedding.
What's the point of writing something on the roof?
May I take your picture?
Tom always orders the cheapest item on the menu.
Tom knows everybody.
I'm not interested in politics.
Are we meeting tomorrow?
Where's Tom sleeping?
"Wait, don't shoot!"
Look up at the sky.
I stayed home because it was raining.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
It'll surely rain today.
Fill up the tank.
Tom owns a hunting rifle.
It's my favorite food.
How many cats does Tom have?
She will be happy when she gets married.
What's your location?
How do you prevent back pain?
I was at a loss for an answer.

He violated a law.
"He is rarely, if ever, late for appointments."
I have to take medicine.
You're unusual.
This book is suitable for beginners.

The work was finished before I arrived.
I'll go on my own.
Please don't touch the ice with bare hands.
Did you murder Tom?
The kid is a pain in the neck.
Tom pocketed the coin.
Does Tom know that you like Mary?
I want to make a good impression.

Who's he?

What you need is a friend.
We've done what we can.
I got on the train for London.
Don't you get it?
You have everything.
Tom is very unscrupulous.
My brother's name is Tom.
Who knows what he'll accomplish if given the chance?
Tom decided not to go to the party.
Tom didn't flinch.
"Because I didn't know what to do, I asked him for advice."
I met Tom at his house.
This car runs great.
We can't let this ruin our friendship.
I think that Tom is ugly.
Those homeless people are living hand-to-mouth.
"At home, we only speak French."
Tom is taller than Mary.
It is premature to discuss it now.
Won't you sit down?
I paid her five dollars.
How long have you been watching me?
What really happened?
Do you wear glasses?
I hope no one saw you come in here.
She will fail eventually.
He proceeded to the next question.
He opened a can of worms.
It'll be dark soon.
Tom was right about that.
Tom found that.
They say it's up to you.
Don't take that too literally.
Tom often talks with Mary.
Many people were killed in the war.
I don't think Tom likes Mary.
I'll try to do that by myself.
I can't stand it.
I don't speak French as fluently as Tom does.
"If I have time, I'll do it."
I was exhausted after running the race.
What's the date of the letter?
The French like to eat frog legs.
I would like to meet you.
Where's the other half of the money?
It's the third biggest city of Serbia.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
I cannot thank you enough for your assistance.
How are things going with Tom?
The lights are out.
Can I borrow your car tonight?
Tom is hopeless.
I don't want to see Tom do that.
Have you ever read a book in French?
Let's study.
There are no spoons.
What would you change?

I'm having fun.
My uncle lived abroad for many years.
It's a bit further way.
We don't have time to clean the whole house.
The students were for the most part from the West Coast.
The desire he has had for years has been fulfilled.
Divide the pizza in three.
I can't get any work done here with all these children in the room.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
Tom motioned for Mary to keep quiet.
It's dangerous out there.
Are you saving this seat for someone?
She's a lot smarter than she looks.
You can wear anything you want.
Do you like playing volleyball?
Is there anything you can do to help?
The Diet will meet on Tuesday.
It occurred to me that I should not keep it secret.
Don't bother to answer this letter.
You should have one of us do it.
"Go straight, then turn right."
This watch keeps correct time.
What are they doing out there?
Tom is trying to lose weight.
I want to have this letter registered.
How does this work?
Tom cooked dinner.
He lost his eyesight.
I saw your father.
Everyone who knew him admired him.
Thank you for telling me.
Perhaps we overlooked something.
John met Mary on his way to school.
I visited Paris a long time ago.
"You don't like me, do you?"
Go and wake Tom up.
That doesn't prove anything.
Don't take what Tom says at face value.
The short circuit blew a fuse.
Tom felt awkward.
The rich are not always happy.
Tom was wearing a faded blue work shirt.
I want some fresh eggs.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
I went on a ten-day trip to Easter Island.
I'm Tom and this is Mary.
A child is missing.
The only thing we can do is wait.
The pay is terrible and the hours are long.
Give me a hand with this refrigerator.
I didn't even consider that.
How could that happen?
I'm grateful for your help.
Tom came home earlier than Mary expected.
It's totally wrong.
The old church by the lake is very beautiful.
Tom went straight to bed.
I want to spend all my time with you.
He knows nothing about politics.
Listening to music is lots of fun.
"Hey, what're you hiding behind your back?"
You should start as early as possible.
I wouldn't want to die here.
It's been five years since that book was made into a movie.
There's a rumor going around that you two are dating.
I have to get home.
Believe what you want.
My girlfriend sometimes flirts with other boys.
Does that guy look familiar to you?
Tom didn't know when Mary's birthday was.
What's it good for?
She bent down.
Is it a deer?
Did you know that?
Usually before a concert there is an announcement asking the audience to either turn off their phones or switch them to manner mode.
I'm not really sure why.
I don't like music as much as you do.
"The other day, I bought a camera."
The road to Nagano is closed to traffic.
I've been misunderstood.
It is difficult to solve this problem.
The train arrived in London.
It's Saturday.
I am taking French next year.
The city library underwent extensive renovations and can now accommodate twice as many books as before.
They all tried to talk at one time.
He slipped me a note.
Tom may not go to Boston until next spring.
I have just been to Sapporo Station to see my mother off.
I want to be an artist.
What you say is true.
She boasts that she can swim well.
I don't have a lot of time right now.
You should be more careful how you talk to people.
I'm surprised Tom's still alive. I thought he would've drunk himself to death years ago.
Is there a reason that you're asking?
I hope Tom won't tell Mary.
Tom seems to be expecting Mary to do something.
Give me the equivalent in dollars.
"Some of them are teachers, and some are engineers."
"You were looking, weren't you?"
It wasn't until long after they got married that Tom found out that Mary was wanted for murder.
Are you sure that Tom is behind this?
Please don't tell anyone about this.
"In the course of our conversation, he referred to his youth."
The judgement is very fair to both parties.
Tom is depressed because his girlfriend left him.
I didn't know that Tom's car was stolen.
Tom whispered something in Mary's ear and she nodded.
Something similar once happened to me.
What's your address?
Tom canceled.
There are only two ways out of this house.
Here's what I think.
Tom doesn't even know Mary.
Tom said he thought I looked lonely.
Tom held the gun to Mary's head.
Tom must be very happy after winning the race.
She isn't poor.
He can be relied on.
Summer has arrived at last.
Thank you for seeing me.
That shirt doesn't go with those pants.
Will you listen to me for a few minutes?
Do you need help?
Our life depends largely on oil imported from other countries.
Tom felt terrible.
Where's the nearest drugstore?
Tom is a DJ.
"You didn't actually lie to Tom, did you?"
Why did you back away?
"At last, I completed my work."
What do you think it is?
Tom lost his temper and hit Mary.
The man raised his hand to ask a question.
He picked up a mirror and looked at his tongue.
She found a ball in the garden.
You're in over your head.
Tom asked Mary to stay at home until the babysitter got there.
We were all so scared.
This is my sister's camera.
Tom dug a hole.
He leaned towards me.
Tom is going to Harvard.
He gave up going abroad to study because of his father's sudden death.
She is the person I was waiting for.
"Yesterday, Tom told me that he'd never been to Boston."
I find it difficult to believe.
Tom doesn't remember if he locked the door.
Is Tom still aboard?
Soldiers shared their food with the Indians.
You must not do that anymore.
Does it hurt?
I agreed to have a drink with Tom after work.
I can't believe I did that.
Tom loves fishing.
Tom threw Mary a rope.
I told Tom that I was tired.

Let your uncle think about it.
The teacher welcomed the new students.
Where can I buy a brush?
You'd better not wait here.
The clock struck ten.
It's magnificent.
Tom can't remember where.
Don't underestimate it.
My grandfather will have read the Bible ten times if he reads it again.
I don't want to lose Tom.
Who were you going to sell it to?
Did you help Tom?
I didn't catch any fish.
We have a lot to do.
Are you coming or not?
I have three cats.
Don't talk to me while I'm working.
I know that Mary loves me.
The number of students is dropping.
I got a farewell present from everyone.
You'd better come in.
I helped Tom wash the dishes.
I could not get out.
Tom was extremely helpful.
Are you happy?
He doesn't have a computer.
I'll stay longer next time.
How much is this tie?
You stink.
You are very brave.
You're unbiased.
She had never dreamed of meeting him abroad.
Tom is already married.
It's my turn to choose where we eat.
What is your older sister doing now?
Have you seen any movies lately?
You should try some of this pie.
What floor do you live on?
He exchanged yen for dollars.
The news shocked me.
Happy workers are better workers.
I don't understand what he said.
Don't let this opportunity slip away!
"Tom knows what to do, doesn't he?"
English is spoken in America.
This makes me think of you.
Get back to work!
Mary is always saying that Tom isn't romantic enough.
What did you do last Sunday?
We are disturbing him.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
He told me that I must finish the work by six.
I envy her.
I assume that you've proofread this already.
Call me when you're ready.
Be a good girl.
He winked at her.
Do you want to crash at my place?
Tom could've said something.
He worked from morning till evening.
It would take a long time to tell the whole story.
You must work.
Mary is mine.
What was it that Tom said that made Mary so angry?
He told me just the opposite!
He couldn't come because he was sick.
He went to the back of the building.
I can't do it now.
May I speak to you in private?
You should do that right now.
He is above suspicion.
The people tried to clear the street of snow.
Tom was only thirteen years old at that time.
"It's true hard work never killed anybody, but why take the chance?"
He complains all the time.
He has a foreign car.
Which way is Central Park?
I'm still working on this.
The tea costs two euros.
Is there a mailbox near here?

School is over.
That doesn't matter.
I like the way that smells.
Everyone is happy.

What's your favorite operating system?
Tom never drives above the speed limit.
I wrote him to ask why.
How many cars do you have?
The curry at this restaurant is good.
Tom threw the car keys to Mary and she caught them.
I've been thinking about something.
I saw her crossing the street.

She plays Bach.
You can't smoke in school.
Do you want to take a walk before going to bed?
What's the point of us being here?
They're Canadians.

This rumor is completely unfounded.
Tom and Mary both should know better.
It's very difficult even for a Japanese to put on a kimono.
My sister asked me to lend her the dictionary.
I want these people out of here.
We're horrible.
We can't worry about that right now.

Are you thinking about getting a job?
Tom has something he wants to say.
I found the problem uncomplicated.
I think I'm the only one working here who can speak French.
Have you already eaten?
No one seems to listen to us anymore.
I'm giving it to you for free.

Too much stress can lead to physical disease.
Tom was wondering if Mary would go out with him.
I'm the same height as Tom is.
Everybody admired his courage.
Tom stopped suddenly.
Tom hid behind a tree.
Mary is very gentle with her baby sister.
I admire them both.
Tom was polite.
I don't want to be seen in his company.
I think it's time for me to do my homework.
The only reason Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be there.
Where's my coat?
We are going to visit our uncle next Sunday.
We want Tom to get better.
"I'm going to miss you, Tom."
Four more are needed to make fifty.

Are you saying you don't want to go?
I'm pretty sure Tom has already made up his mind.
New York State is almost as large as Greece.
I hope you enjoy your stay with us.
The teacher pointed out the pupil's mistakes.

Maybe we should tell Tom that he's being obnoxious.
I don't know anything about him at all.
I have almost no money with me.
I don't live here.
Whose bicycle is this?
What's new?
Tom hasn't done anything to be ashamed of.
What language is that?
How was your stay?
"Everyone, say hello to Tom."
I'm a good cook.
I bought a hybrid.
I am very sensitive to heat.
The fact is apparent to the most casual observer.

He can run fast.
This doesn't look like Tom's handwriting.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.

Is one thousand yen enough?
We aren't Canadians.

He was not disappointed.

This joke doesn't have anything to do with you.
Please answer the question.
Do you know whose car this is?
"OK, I think I get it."
I'm looking for a sweater.
I came to tell you not to worry.
I thought you said you worked here.
"If you don't want to do this, you don't have to."
Tom needed more.
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary.
How long have you been in Boston?
Make sure that nobody enters.
Tom and Mary are very happy.
I've never heard such a thing.
I think Tom is too young to be dating.
We were incorrect.
What you're doing right now is impolite.

"If you don't want to stay, you don't have to."
My whole body is black and blue.

I cry every time I hear this song.
The police have one of the kidnappers in custody.
They stared at her swimming suit in amazement.

This money is for a rainy day.
The fire went out by itself.
I've decided not to swim this afternoon.

He looked for his book for an hour.
This is a picture of my family.
Why should I be scared?
Whose letter is this?
How long have you been playing the violin?
They work hard.
I know Tom doesn't like you.
That's not a secret.
We walked slowly along the road.
She will be here before long.
He is reading.
Why do you want Tom to do that?

How did you find out it was me?
How could you do that?
You do that and I'll fire you.
Have you read today's paper?

"I like my soup to be warm, not hot."
How did Tom convince Mary to marry him?
I want you to sing me a song.
"Tom may have said that, but I don't think so."
They stopped.
I assure you that won't be necessary.
I made him sweep the floor.
The first two days of my trip were rainy.
He resumed reading after lunch.
I know where to look for Tom.
Everything is working.
Have a look at that picture.
Tom talked to Mary's neighbors and asked them if they knew where she'd gone.
His ID was fake.
My foot hurts.

The lake is big.
I spent the whole evening reading the poetry of Kenji Miyazawa.

I cannot possibly help you.
Why do I have to study French?
Tom slept in his office.
Do you want to know his name?
Look at the stars.
How romantic!
Tom has a craving for chocolate ice cream.
I don't think his story is true.
Tom thinks his country is the greatest country in the world.
Tom is walking down the hall.
Here's one for you.
Tom wishes to speak with me.
It was overcast yesterday.
"I'm sorry, my mother's not at home."
We need a map.
"If you want me to kiss you, all you have to do is ask."
Does Tom know my name?
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?

I eat cornflakes for breakfast.
The boy lifted the heavy box with one hand.
Don't bother me with such foolish questions.
He is a danger to society.

I am just dreaming.
Don't let the soup get cold.
Did you say you had a cat?

Don't forget to write to us.
Why doesn't Tom have to do that?
I have visited Kyoto three times.
It seems that you don't want me to succeed.
Tom has a pain in his big toe on his right foot.
"When we made fun of her, she blushed."
I have a feeling today is going to be interesting.
We have many rainy days in June.

Tom wanted to stay.
"At the end of the class, the teacher said, ""That's enough for today."""
Why ask me? Wouldn't it be better to do it yourself?
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
Tom didn't have time to finish his report.
I hear you're moving to Australia.
The dog ran after the cat.
It wasn't exactly a secret.
Tom got up and began pacing.
I'm a translator.
Tom may not want to do that.
Do you have any idea why Tom isn't here?
They are facing financial problems.
We've got a problem here.
I'll have to ask around.
I paid ten dollars for this cap.
Some people read books to kill time.
I feel like you're keeping something from me.
Did Tom call you?
She looked around the room.
He pushed his nose against the window.
We're here for Tom.
Who's after you?
Tom didn't have a girlfriend.
I thought I was going to faint.
I don't have a home.
Tom is talking to himself.
"When there's a piano to be moved, don't reach for the stool."
Let Tom come aboard.
"It's very difficult to transport them overland, but simple to do so by sea."
"Tom Jackson was born in Boston on October 20, 1995."
He can't see the forest for the trees.

The lawyer's fee was very high.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
The baby seemed to be fast asleep.
"You do understand me, don't you?"
Tom took his own life.
The secret will soon get out.
I'm glad to see that you're happy.
May I ask what that means?
The question is how much.
I never got an answer from Tom.
Tom will never love you.
The town has changed a lot since then.
We don't have a chance.
"We could have our tea in the garden, were it a little warmer."
Go back outside.
The child threw a stone at the dog.
He lent me two books.
I don't watch TV anymore.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
It's hard to find good help these days.
Tom just arrived.
Are you sure you want to throw that one away?
"We have a lot more to do, so we don't have time to take a break."
She gets prettier day by day.
Take the subway right here.
I stayed.
I enjoyed reading about your dreams.
It isn't much further.
Tom and Mary picked some wildflowers by the river.
How do you spell that word?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Don't you know what it is?
Tom often came here as a student.
It's quite simple.
That requires careful consideration.
You're quite a liar.
Get out of my life!
Perhaps you'd be willing to volunteer.
I sent you a new e-mail.
"Will you go, too?"
How did you know all that?
Do you think they're coming after us?
"I understand, but I cannot agree."
There was no way to hide it.
Translate the underlined sentences.
The children went out to play.
"So, what do you suggest?"
Tom wants to talk to you again.
What should I wear?
How many times do I need to repeat it?
This is different from what I thought.
I didn't see any tigers.
Speak up. I can't hear you.
Don't get any ideas.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
Which way is the beach?
He hung up.
What would happen if you didn't do what Tom told you to?
They arrested a man named Lee Harvey Oswald.
I owe everything to you.
We must work faster.
Why don't you take off?
Did you really plan to do this all yourself?
Tom lives on the same street as me.
"In the summer, the temperature ranges from thirty to forty degrees Celsius."
She's worried about your safety.
Why don't you polish the shoes with this cloth?
I need a bucket.
It's been a while since I've eaten cottage cheese.
I really appreciate your kindness.
What time does the ship leave?

He has left his family.
I wish the circumstances were different.
There is a cherry tree in front of my house.
They pushed back the attackers.
Tom chose wisely.
Please turn off the light.

You're useless.
I'm still shopping around.
I'd rather not do that.
Can you help?
He asked me who painted the picture.
"Her wishes, it seems, have come true."
This is my pencil.
What're you asking?
What do you think has become of him?
It's unbelievable how fast time flies.
"I'm really tired, so I'm going to go to bed early tonight."
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
Tom looked at his watch and saw that he only had five minutes left until lunchtime.
He did a pretty good job.
"According to today's paper, there was a fire in the city."
It's not new.
You tried.
This intersection is dangerous.
Tom has a violent temper.
You are as white as a sheet.
The moon has set.
It was a waste of time.
Tom owns two houses and a boat.
She stabbed him.
Tom can't believe Mary's over thirty.
Don't come complaining to me when it bites you.
He knows how to make his wife happy.
Everything went smoothly.
I'm getting off at the next stop.
She is very afraid of the dark.
"I'm sorry, but my answer is no."
I didn't want to tell you.
It was really quite exciting.
Is it tasty?
Wait just a second.
Remain exactly where you are.
Tom took his gloves off.
It was the calm before the storm.
They really seem to dislike spinach.
I have heard this story scores of times.
Why don't you come and see me sometime?
Don't trust him.
Let's start as soon as he comes.
Tom never showed.
I can't go with you.
Tom doesn't like that at all.
It's a beautiful song.
The shop carried leather goods.
Do you miss Boston?
I won't stand for it.
It hasn't changed one iota.
Tom needs someone to talk to.
Do a little work! You'll lose some weight.
I didn't know you were a surgeon.
I'm really too drunk for this now.
"It may seem like an awful lot of money, but it'll be money well spent."
"You know something, don't you?"

She's my type.
Don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam.

How many people do you know well?
We're the Jacksons.
"Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you."
Don't you like your job anymore?
Buy the dress you want.
He was subjected to severe criticism.

What's wrong with that?
He hanged himself.
"You want to leave here, don't you?"
You should wash your hair.
People can't tell us apart.
I steered clear of sensitive topics.
I don't believe I caught your name.
I found out about it on the news.
Tom knows Boston.
Never trust anybody.
You should've declined the invitation.
Tom always complains about the way I do things.
It wasn't a party.
You sound disappointed.
Tom heard Mary's voice.
I know a girl who can ride a unicycle.
I don't know much about you.
I think you should swim.
Tom stood up and followed Mary out of the office.

Please give me a piece of bread.
I didn't think it mattered.
Tom said he enjoyed the party.
Tom wanted to live in Boston.
Why does Tom do that?
Tom knows guns.
It won't be long before they get married.
It shouldn't matter.
You must help her.
I spoke to Tom just a few minutes ago.
He's got what it takes to make it in the business world.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
I didn't tell anybody about it.
The meaning of this sentence is ambiguous.
Tom and Mary liked each other instantly.
Tom enjoys your company.
Do you want to risk that?
Three people were stabbed on Park Street last night.
What is this?
Where's the nearest train station?
Show me how it works.
We won't stand a chance.
I am heating the dinner.
I hope Tom never finds out.
I simply don't trust Tom.
"To find degrees in centigrade, subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature, then multiply by 5/9."
We regret doing that.
We didn't help Tom escape.
It hurt really bad.
We won't know until October.
I'm studying very hard.
Please bear this fact in mind.
I have horrible heartburn.
I didn't want to alarm you.
When does Tom go to school?
He just wants attention.
Tom can't help it.
Leave the matter to me.
Don't you agree?
What's your favorite music?
Are we all happy?
I'll give you Dr. Shiegal's telephone number.
Tom went to see Mary three days after that.
Tom looked deeply into Mary's eyes and smiled.
Maybe I fell asleep.
I want to hear what you have to say.
I want to change the world.
They were very confused.
No one can match him in English.
All Tom does is watch TV.
I didn't want that.
I think Tom is honest.
Tom has come back from Australia.
Sit down.
What's your diagnosis?
Do I curse too much?
Tom lives near here.
That's not the way it happened at all.
Tom phoned.
It is highly improper.
"When I got up this morning, it was raining."
You're fine.
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.
This car comes with an air conditioner.
Sometimes that's just the way it is.
I don't understand what you are saying.
He hates spiders.
I have visited the place time after time.
He seems to have a touch of fever.
I am laughing at Tom.
It's all a terrible misunderstanding.
Do you know how my friends describe me?
Would you please tell me when to get off?

About how many books do you have?
You may still do it if you want to.
This movie makes no sense.
My husband is lazy.
Few people live to be a hundred.
I am very glad to see you.
Stop filming.
Tom isn't ready yet.
I can't guarantee we'll be able to get the job done by next Monday.
Tom refused to ask for directions.
I'm going to go find Tom.
I'm very happy for Tom.
Tom hoped the video he just uploaded to YouTube would go viral.
What made you want to become an anesthesiologist?
What kind of a parent would leave their child unattended in the car outside the pub while they're inside drinking?
It'll make sense when you're older.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand."
Are you no longer in pain?
Tom will speak.
I feel on top of the world.
Would you mind repeating the question?
Mark the right answer.
Don't trust what Tom says.
My place isn't usually this much of a mess.
Do you really want to change?
What's this got to do with Tom?
He put in a good word for me.
One day he killed himself.

Go away.
I must do as Tom wishes.

It doesn't matter what she said.
I can't hear you.
I'll look it up.
I'm expecting.
It's been a while since I've ridden a horse.
Tom doesn't want to get his hands dirty.
Do you have any news?
"She fell ill, but got well soon."

I hope you have fun.

This book is easy enough for children to read.
I only eat vegetables.

She has a negative attitude toward life.

How come this never happens to me?
Tom closed the door quietly and tiptoed into the room.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
Did Tom say something?

We have to stop it.
We have a traitor among us.

That's very naughty of you.

How did you achieve that?
You don't actually believe that story?
Dogs are faithful.
Preserves must be stored in a jar with an airtight seal.
It's a difficult country to govern.
She startled him.
He lay on his back.
This is the corner where Tom got hit by a car.
I can't find my glasses anywhere.
It is you who is to blame.
That's not going to help.
You should quit smoking.
That small star is brightest.
It is strange that he knows nothing about the matter.
I'd rather not ask Tom to do that.

The rumor quickly spread.
I'd prefer red wine.
"I thought he loved you, but as it is, he loved another girl."
I'll stop by later.
Have another cup of coffee.
He's the most valuable player on our team.
The sky was full of clouds that night.
I can't make that decision without talking to Tom first.
Keep me informed.
They love it.
You should make use of this chance.
Almost everybody was invited.
Are you 18?
Do you believe what he said?
He looked quite tired.
Tom doesn't know about Mary's death yet.
The dog looks sick.

How do I look tonight?
I was too drunk.
Everybody's doing something.
Do you object to smoking?
What if he's wrong?
I want to sleep a little more.
"When she was young, she was very beautiful."
He agreed with me.
You could ask Tom.
I'm a salesman.
Try not to worry about it.
Tom tiptoed into the room.
Is this the best you can do?
Could you tell me something about yourself?
He has not seen much of the world.
Tom's older than me.
Tom's team is the worst team in the league.
I always list what I need before I go shopping.
It certainly looks like rain.
We can't force people to do that.
Mary filled her bucket with sand using a plastic shovel.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
Your mother will repeat it to you as many times as necessary.
Here's something I want you to give to Tom.
I shouldn't have been so rude.
Tom lived next door to us for three years.
It's too low.
Do you need a visa to go to Australia if you have a British passport?
"Right now, all I want to do is sleep for a few hours."
I've been on the phone all afternoon.
"Red wine, please."
I've been busy this week.
You'll never be alone again.
You haven't answered my question.
Tom wasn't expecting Mary to do that.
What makes you think I'd want to see that?
Tom bought a camera to give to Mary.
Tom washed the car.
I knew your brother.
The bag is full.
Does your dog bite?
When was the last time you had a bath?
There is a desk in a corner of the room.
"As our fingers touched, I felt a shiver run through me."
Where is my brother?
Tom walked along the shore alone.
Let's get out of here before it's too late.
Tom asked for my number.
Did you actually see the accident?
How much do you like Tom?
Tom isn't a student. He's a teacher.
We are going to check it right away.
Tell me where to go next.
What kind of things do you enjoy doing?
I don't know how I should do it.
People blamed Tom.
Tell me more about yourself.

Don't be like that.
They made the same mistake again.
Tom stayed calm.
Tom doesn't drive as fast as Mary does.
Are you good at playing the piano?
Tom plans to throw away his old toaster.
He's uninsured.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
Are meals included?
Did you get a haircut?
I don't want the money.
Tom will most likely be the first one to show up.
I had a fantastic time.
"I think that's very sweet, Tom."
She played a trick on my sister.
"She can play tennis very well, but I can play as well as she can."
I know him by name.
Is Tom under arrest?
There's so much I want to say to you.
It seems that something has happened.
You should pay attention.
Where were you the night that Tom was murdered?
Have you ever written a book?
A thorough investigation is now in progress.
I got a telescope for my birthday.
Tom is only pretending that he doesn't know.
Thank you very much for the undeserved attention.
Tom is very particular about what he eats.
I'd love to meet him.
I'm not a mind reader. You need to tell me what you want.
I've been here for an hour.
Let's proceed.
How rich is Tom?
I will give you this book.
Did you vote in the last election?
Tom and Mary both prefer watching comedies.
Tom was not able to quit smoking.
Tom sat down beside Mary on the bench.
Tom wants Mary to know he likes her a lot.
Does your wife know all this?
Won't you get in trouble for this?
No one likes it.
It was a warm summer night.
He went out of his way to find the house for me.
Can you stop it?
This form looks kind of complicated. Help me fill it out.
They charged me for the broken window.
All I think about is you.
She may not come.
Tom comes to Boston every two months.
Tom was at the sink washing dishes.
"If you are to succeed, you must try harder."
You have an e-mail message in your inbox.
That's not a good idea.
I think I'll buy a new car.
Tom looks furious.
Please show me the green shirt.
The content of the letter had an interesting effect on my marriage.
I want to see the movie again.
We have to do it together.
This I can agree with.
He is the last person I want to see now.
You don't have to go inside. You can pay at the pump.
She smiled sadly.
We discussed a number of options.
Do you know where Tokyo Tower is?
Tom's mother told him a story.
Do your work as you see fit.
Tom said that he thinks that you're stupid.
I know the situation is very difficult for us.
We're all proud of you.
Here is your dog. Where is mine?
I like coffee better than black tea.
She's a very good teacher.
Stop sticking your nose into other people's business.
The police began to look into the matter.
I keep it in the attic.
It is cold today.
The plane crashed.
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
You've cut my hair too short.
"If you behave like a flunkey, you're treated like a flunkey."
I have eight brothers and sisters.
Words cannot describe the beauty.
We've decided to move the meeting to next Sunday.
Tom made a mistake in choosing Mary for the job.
Tom kept digging.
I never got caught.
"All of you speak French, right?"
I wish I'd been smart enough to do that.
Tom and Mary were able to figure it out on their own.
Women don't drive as well as men.
I've read both books.
She was afraid of the dog.
I understand it more or less.
Not all baby animals are cute.
Why didn't you warn me?
What else can I do for you?
The house seemed about to collapse at any moment.
That time table gives the hours of arrival and departure.
Today was a very tough day.
Tom seems a little nervous.
The kid already speaks pretty well.
He said that that girl had kissed him.
She loves Tom more than she loves me.
I know what you're thinking.
Tom has a skeleton key.
She had a happy childhood.
"She advised him to drink more milk, but he didn't think this was good advice."
I play the tenor saxophone.
Tom played the piano and Mary sang.
It's going great.
I heard Tom screaming.
Have you finished reading the novel?
Is it dangerous to take a subway alone?
"Hang up your coat, please."
Tom has three French dictionaries.
We're friends now.
Tom was defeated.
What are you doing in Brazil?
Don't say that word ever again.
Tom wanted people to like him.
We can do better than that.
Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
Is it safe to swim in this river?
Tom isn't losing.
I'm so fat.
I hate being a boss.
He boasted of his courage.
Stop worrying and get some sleep.
Tom's mother's name is Mary.
What's the pay like?
I want to spend my life with you.
It took me several hours to repair it.
How do we look?
Tom is packing his suitcase.
She's a smart girl.
Who brought this?
That's just as bad.
I'm not going to stay here with you.
Thanks for bringing Tom home.
"You've been through a lot, haven't you?"
I'm a good student.
Tom's apartment was small.
My sister works as a secretary in a big multinational.
I can't explain that either.
Get away from here.
You should be on your guard when doing business with strangers.
I need a little more time.
The people came out of their houses to listen to his music.
This organization lacks unity.
We'll fight.
We cannot decide whether to go to college or not.
Tom will sue you.
"If it were up to me, I'd say yes."
Where are you calling from?
The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic with the Pacific.
Was that your plan?
"Don't ask questions, just come with me."
Tom has a Canadian wife.
Tom seems to be very excited.
I'm not going to help Tom.
Did you like that?
I appreciate what you did for me.
She had a strange hat on.
The square root of one hundred forty-four is twelve.
Saint Peter's Square is crowded.
Do you want to touch it?
There's hardly any water in the bucket.
We're having difficulty finding someone who'll lend us the money we need.
My leg is still asleep.
I think we need more water.
"As far as I know, he is an honest man."
How did you get those?
I dreamed I was in a very strange situation.
You'll regret having said those words.
Tom has ants in his pants.
Thank you very much for your hospitality.
Nobody is really sure.
Tom confronted Mary.
How many more days are there until Christmas?
Tom slept on the bus.
I've heard good things about you.
Have you finished your coffee?
Some people would question the truth of such rumors.
Does Tom need anything else?
The man regained the use of his left arm.
Tom ran out of food.
Enjoy your evening.
I spent last Sunday reading novels.
I always enjoy listening to classical music when I have some free time.
Let's begin.
Today is Thursday.
You look good in that suit.
Would you give me a cigarette?
The soap irritated my eyes.
I found it difficult to make myself understood.
Tom used to be conceited.
She cannot play the piano.
Tom is shorter than me.
All I really want is to be left alone.
Is that ring made of real gold?
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me.
Some Germans work for only one euro an hour.
She told me his name after he had left.
We were all asleep.
What method do you use to organize your files?
Is that a confession?
I wonder why Tom bought that.
That's just a start.
Tom plays the vibraphone exceptionally well.
I think about him all the time.
Tom left without telling anyone.
I will definitely attend your funeral.
"Strictly speaking, that's true."
What is it you're afraid of?
I had rented it the day before.
I cannot read without glasses.
I do not allow sleeping in class.
He's worried we'll lose the way.
Which browser are you using?
Who responded?
What happened to the money?
Tom didn't ask.
Who are you afraid of?
Tom shouldn't have been there.
"In other words, she's dumb."
Tom is in his office.
The train stopped in Baltimore.
We haven't tried the drug out on humans yet.
Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.
I want to be more independent.
Tom drank himself into a stupor when Mary walked out on him.
Tom has some good news to tell you.
Can I do anything for you?
I hope there's no more red tape.
Tom is sleeping.
It rained hard all day.
I have something important to discuss with Tom.
"You were hungry, weren't you?"
Tom was quite handsome when he was young.
What's his track record like?
Who took the picture?
Tom repeated his question.
Tom was surprised to hear Mary had gotten married.
I like being a teacher.
Do your very best.
"He is short, but strong."
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston?
I guess I'm a little antsy.
We have decided on leaving this town tomorrow morning.
There's never a dull moment when Tom is around.
I'm bored and don't know what to do.
"As humans age, their physical strength declines."
What's your favorite lipstick brand?
I had fun here.
I'm a respectable businessman.
What did you study in Germany?
That is my school.
Take what you want.
They are older than Tom.
Trust me.
I didn't mind doing that at all.
Get out while you can.
Mary is Tom's daughter.
We've arrived.
This river flows into the Pacific Ocean.
I'm up to my neck in work.
I'm busy right now.
Have you been paying attention?
The police forced a confession from her.
I'm not going to work with you today.
Why did you listen to him?
Thank you for your detailed explanation.
Did you get me anything?
Where are your clothes?
The piano was invented in the 18th century by Bartolomeo Cristofori.
I'm looking for one of my sisters.
I want to live here.
He is never in the office in the morning.
Put the book back where you found it.
You are very courageous.
Is your gun loaded?
Do you always get up this early?
"When we are told not to come, we become all the more eager to go."
I want to thank you for all your help.
Tom went window-shopping.
Hug me.
Tom seems lost.
I wish Tom could be here with us today.
I just want to be left alone.
Please wake me up at seven.
Things got a little out of hand.
That was different.
I have heartburn.
We will have to consider each application on a case-by-case basis.
We should always obey laws.
Tom has an uncle who is a banker.
I love hamburgers.
He likes to dress up as a police officer.
Even a clock that is stopped shows the correct time twice a day.
I had a pretty happy childhood.
Tom was wearing a black hat.
Come here.
I'll do my best.
Our supplies won't last forever.
She is always neat and tidy.
Tom took a very deep breath.
Tom asked me what had happened to Mary.
Tom is here to see you.
Don't think that I'm going to let you get away.
We understand that.
Don't you read the sports pages?
I forgot to turn off the television before going to sleep.
I must find out.
It is no use pretending you know nothing about it.
Can I come over?
Tom took questions from the audience.
You don't know what it is to be poor.
She's smarter than him.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You live and learn.
The bar is closing soon.
Can you recommend a place to stay in London?
You can't stay here.
Nobody believed you.
If only I had a pretty dress like that!
Do Martians speak English?
Did you speak to Tom about this?
I now know why Tom did what he did.
"She ignored him, which proved unwise."
He felt at home.
I'm not that desperate yet.
Tom used his handkerchief to wipe the tears from Mary's cheeks.
I did nothing.
That's what I told him.
How many years have you been studying French?
The Emperor prayed for the souls of the deceased.
He got out a book and began to read it.
I am sure this book will be of great use to you.
You should stay at home today.
African Americans demonstrated for civil rights.
I'll go provided you go with me.
I think it's clearing up.
"We can see who's laughing, but not who's crying."
Tom has changed jobs.
Tom isn't like Mary.
She makes a good living.
I don't want to make a big deal out of this.
That's exactly what I meant.
I am getting off at the next station.
My cat is following me.
Tom is extremely gullible.
Tom didn't notice it.
He was surprised at the news.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary was going to eventually leave him.
We're definitely not perfect.
Tom drove the injured bicyclist to the hospital.
Tom was not pleased.
I need your cooperation.

Please tell the others everything you've just told me.
My grandmother is still vigorous at 82 years old.

Tom doesn't want to go anywhere today.
How long did you stay in Boston?
You can't scare me.
I'm not being paid enough.
Would you like to watch a movie?
Could you turn it down?

The room is full of flowers.
What did you want to show me?

Why didn't you ask me?

Has Tom returned?
I'm in my apartment.
When was the last time you washed the car?
The egg is a universal symbol of life and rebirth.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Those Hungarian girls are very pretty.
I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore.
Cutting a cake into equal pieces is rather difficult.
I'd like to help you.
Don't walk away from me.
Who asked you to do that?
I did a stupid thing last night.
Valentine's Day is coming up.
Do you think you're obese?
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
She seems to have known the secret.
I don't have as much money as you think.
It has never been done before.
Nobody forced me to do that.
That was our plan.
I found the photo you were looking for.
I hear that you're very good at what you do.
Tom could find Mary's house easily.
There were about one thousand people.
It would be a pity if you let this opportunity pass you by.
The province is rich in mineral resources.
Is he really the man you're looking for?
"Courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway."
Tom couldn't make it to Mary's party.
You could've walked away.
Are you interested in buying an encyclopedia?
Are you coming to my house next Sunday?

He says that he has no memory of the evening.
I must go right away.
I asked Tom to play my favorite song.
Tom peeked in the window and saw Mary and John kissing.
Tom is busy right now and he can't help you.
I don't understand what you guys are saying.
Anybody knows it.
The time will come when you will regret this.
There are seedless grapes and seedless watermelons. I wonder if there are seedless mangoes.
What'll you do there?
Tom started snoring.
Tom could see that Mary was shocked.
"The world's largest zoo is in Berlin, Germany."
I chose to leave instead of staying behind.
We want some advice.
No one believed what you said.
I don't believe in religion.
I gave the book to my friend.
There's still a fair bit of work to be done.
What do you do in your spare time?
I don't understand you.

He made a rude reply.
Thank you for asking me.

I'm having fun.
Tom says that he's tired.
Tell him to come here at once.
This will help keep you warm.
Mary wouldn't let Tom kiss her.
Tom said that he'd call me back.
A lot of people feel the same way you do.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Is this your picture?
Tom used to date my daughter.
Do you know her at all?
Let's try to solve the riddle.
Do you like Earl Grey tea?

May I call on you some day?
Do you want another one of these?

I don't hate you anymore.
That's already been discussed.
It sounds familiar.
I do not want to reject this claim.
Do you really think that's a good idea?
Where can one buy books?
I think we can be competitive.
I had him carry my luggage to the platform.
Who're you looking for?
It's Tom's duty.
Stand the book on end.
"If you wish to speak to Tom, you'll need to wait about three hours."
Call the police!
Let's schedule it for some other time.
Let us know if you're coming.
I think the best is yet to come.
Maybe you should've told Tom the truth.

This doesn't mean a thing to me.
I'm one of the thirty people who had to do that.
I've gained weight.

What were you planning to do?
It's thirty degrees below zero.
"Drink with me, Tom."

Do you like this wallet?
What do you think of this work?
You have to be prepared for anything.
I don't mind the heat.

Don't give it to anyone.
Have you ever tried to swim across this river?
I just had our house painted.
He asked for more money.
Tom and Mary tossed a ball back and forth.
Don't you want to swim today?
She told him to stop.
I don't know all the details.
There are hardly any books in this room.
The cut will heal up in a few days.
He walks to school.
Tom knows why.
Why doesn't he come back?
I'd like a table by the window.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
Tom saw Mary doing that.
Everybody hates Tom.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
I fell asleep with my contacts in.
I was born the year the war ended.
This could come in handy.
This is just stupid.
This is just too big to carry.
Tom didn't ask what the rules were.
Do you know which road leads to my house?
I must help her at any cost.
Mary looks hot.
This place is nice and quiet.
"The children are moving their toothbrushes as if they are cleaning their teeth, but they can't fool me."
Now you owe me.
There were nice pictures on that wall.
What were you doing when I called you yesterday?
You must help us.
What do you want to hear from me?
Tom couldn't control himself.
Darcy said nothing at all.
Do you enjoy working from home?

There can be only one explanation for that.
I work for a trading company.
"When I was your age, I had a job."
Tom met his wife when he was studying in Germany.
I warned him of the danger.
You're the man.
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
I have your dog with me.
The piano won't go through that door.
This is why I need help.
How about another round?

Why don't you just tell Tom?
Tom didn't sing.
I'd like to get to know you better.
Bongos are smaller than congas.
I have no time to explain this in detail.

That's all for today.
Is this ball yours or hers?
I've lost count of how many times you've helped me.
Tom said something in French and then left the room.
Tom is dressed a little more casually than usual.
Where did you park the car?
Tom uses the same dictionary as I do.
Tom hesitated.
Just where do you think you're going?
I'm not at all tired.
What do you suggest doing?
I haven't heard anything.
They are both good students.
I've always preferred working alone.
That adds a new dimension to our problem.
I'll come and get you.
I heard you broke up with your girlfriend.
She didn't reply.
Tom and Mary have been here since 2003.
This is sabotage.
I see a flower on the desk.
I went to your website.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
She beat him to death.
Yesterday was the first time that Tom had ever played in front of an audience.
It is obvious that he is right.
Sorry to be late.
You've lost too much blood.
"You have seen Tokyo Tower, haven't you?"
He bought an English book at a bookstore.
It's not at all rare to live to be over ninety years old.
How'd you get here?
Tom knows that I'm Canadian.
Tom always tries to avoid trouble.
Leave a message and I'll call you.
We had better not remain here any longer.
She was shaken by the accident.
Tom was Mary's stepchild.
Whose side are you on?
How did you come to hear that?
They took on more than they could handle.
Tom was just about to leave as I arrived.
"You had a really rough day, didn't you?"
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen.
Is the coffee hot?

I answered the question.
Tom kept Mary waiting for an hour.
I have money enough to buy it.
Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal?
"I work on a farm, said Tom."
You're embarrassing them.
"Could you repeat that, please?"
This book is really old.
I like jazz music.
It's worse than I thought.
She turned down my offer.
"If you don't want to do it for Tom, then do it for me."
You just saved me a lot of time.
Do you know where the money is?
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
It's not like I don't want to do it.
Yellow fever and smallpox were no longer a threat.
This word has two meanings.
Is dinner ready?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
"He failed, due to lack of money."
He left everything to chance.
Mary wants to sweep the house.
Tom rarely gets angry.
I've decided to make something for us to eat.
When was the last time you had your hair cut?
I don't think she can speak French.
I didn't try to go any further.
Tom taught Mary a lot of useful French.
I just don't think I'm successful enough.
Is this legal?
It's great to be with you.
"I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend."
Did Tom ask for help?
The surviving refugees longed for freedom.
What do you enjoy doing?
It was very ugly.
This town hasn't changed a bit since the 1970's.
It's good to get up early in the morning.
Tom twirled the basketball on his finger.
It is his decision.
Don't let children play in the road.
I am no match for him.
We'll miss you when you're gone.
The glass is clean.
The pain has started to ease now.
Your friend is correct.
You can eat whatever you like.
This park reminds me of my childhood.
I don't think Tom will mind.
"If you have no liking for modern music, you will not enjoy this concert."
Tom isn't at all selfish.
"There were many signs in the park that said ""Keep off the grass."""
Send me the amount by money order.
She attributed her success to good luck.
It's not up to me.
My camera is the same as your camera.
I wondered why people were staring at me.
It won't cost you a dime.
Come along with us.
"If you want to be free, destroy your television set."
Where can I go to get a map of Europe?
Tom asked Mary whether she planned to swim or not.
How about tomorrow?
We want it back.
"Even though Tom begged Mary not to go, she left with the children and went to live with her mother."
He runs a lot of hotels.
Where's my father?
Tom is swamped with work.
I'll be happy to help you look for an apartment.
Thousands of satellites orbit around the earth.
Tom is throwing stones at birds.
The only thing that mattered to Tom was that we weren't impolite to his boss.
Have you fed the horse?
I believe you have my umbrella.
I don't know much about Australia.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
What else did you see?
Are you going to see Tom?
These diamonds are from South Africa.
I forgot to turn off the light.
"You've been through a lot, haven't you?"
I don't like to go out without a coat on such a cold day.
You've got no right to say that.
One must be responsible for one's conduct.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
I'm doing the right thing.
"I'll miss you, Tom."
The patient is sick beyond all hope.
Your approval is not required.
Let's eat lunch outside.
I was in trouble with the police last night.
There are a great many forest fires in America.
I've never been robbed.
Do you want to see Tom again?
What I want is a word processor.
I'd like to pay.
That question is under discussion.
He saw no advantage in waiting any longer.
I arrived on the night he left.
What did Tom have?
I applied for the job and got it.
A year has twelve months.
Someone's coming.
I'm really not all that hungry.
My brother is a teacher.
Let me tell you what Tom said.
There is a glass on the table.
You had better supplement your diet with vitamins.
Where do you usually go to get a haircut?
Are you enjoying good health?
Tom hoped that Mary was all right.
Tom studies French for an hour every day before dinner.
He's curious about everything.
Do you mind if I turn down the TV?
What goes on in this room?
How is your sister?
How are you going to do it?
Tom thinks he knows where Mary went.
I'm very fortunate.
I ran into an old friend.
The injury caused the athlete great pain.
Can I eat in my room?
Tom promised never to be late again.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were related.
I wish I could help.
He married twice and had more than 20 children.
Don't kill me.
The crankshaft is broken.
Don't stay up late at night.
Do you deny it?
Does this ring a bell?
I suddenly felt the urge to jump off the bridge into the river.
Mary was burned at the stake.
Someone ate all the cookies from the cookie jar.
Does Tom want me to go with him?
You should probably tell Tom you don't want to do that.
I can't tell him apart from his brother.
I ride a bike to work.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
Why don't you get yourself a decent house?
I don't know how you can eat that.
Tom didn't want to ask for help.
My watch is waterproof.
Tom's Bible reading group petered out after a few months through lack of interest.
Tom doesn't like me much.
You're not the only one with secrets.
I don't like bad children.
What is his age?
Tom should be here.
"If it hadn't been for the seatbelt, I wouldn't be alive today."
We have a few days before Tom arrives.
Tom got off scot-free.
Tom is planning to redecorate his bedroom.
I suppose it could have been Tom who ate my ham sandwich.
Laser printers are generally less expensive to maintain than ink jet printers.
What's wrong with your dog?
My 3-year-old is really getting on my nerves.
I'm very proud of you.
What do you think of this plan?
I think what you just told me was a lie.
I think they're wrong.
Why would I say anything?
It's time for our children to go to bed.
I saw the old man feed his dog chicken bones.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
Tom has been fired three times.
"I really, really want this."
That's me.
What are you running from?
Look into the matter more carefully.
This is my favorite color.
He told her something and she smiled.
I have never read that book.
I am a tourist.
I've got to do this.
Is there something in particular that you want?
Parents should deal fairly with their children.
"Don't answer me back like that, Tom."
Do you have a roll of toilet paper?
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
Would you explain it again?
I taught Tom French for three years.
Breakfast is served at seven a.m.
Do you work well under pressure?
I like her novel.
Tom lied to Mary.
Tom was late again this morning.
"Unfortunately, I missed all the fun."
The town grew into a city.
The old man is hard to please.
I have two gifts for friends.
What stop is this?
Tom is annoying Mary.
Tom drinks too much.
Is that why you called?
The sun is starting to go down.
Tom and Mary almost got married last summer.
Tom and Mary used to go out together.
I want to stay.
It is dangerous to cross that old bridge.
Did you see anybody there?
Nothing has to be done.
Tom doesn't struggle like this.
He did not work on Sunday night.
December 24th is Christmas Eve.
I have an allergy to milk.
"Since then, his faith has been severely shaken."
Shall I give you something to read?
Don't embarrass me.
They think that Tom followed Mary home and killed her.
They will tear down the old building in two days.
I don't feel safe here.
Perhaps he could solve this problem.
He interrupted his work to answer the phone.
I sat next to him.
He was unimpressed.
Be careful. Don't drop the tray.
Tom didn't listen.
The ball hit him on the left side of the head.
We shouldn't lose hope.
It's very hard to get rid of the cockroaches in our house.
Tom felt hungry.
The library is on the 4th floor.
"Tom isn't photogenic, but Mary is."
Tom carried the dirty dishes into the kitchen.
I'll be ready in a jiffy.
I can prove it to you.
"In spite of the storm, he went out."
You should've let me help you.
I hoped to have finished it by this week.
I disagree with Tom's statement.
The climate of New Zealand is similar to that of Japan.
Make sure that the dog does not escape.
Sulfur is used to make matches.
Animals can't tell what's real and what's fake.
You can't deny it.
Cocoa can be very bitter.

Tom broke Mary's expensive Chinese Ming vase.
Tom is warm and generous.
Tom seems to think that he's invincible.
That house is mine.
What do you think of the new guy?
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
Tom might object.
Success can only be achieved through hard work.
Tom and Mary stared into each other's eyes.
"I told him of our plans, but he seemed uninterested."
I'm not mad at you.
Tom explained the situation to Mary.
Tom has gone home.
Where can I get in touch with you?
Does this bus go to the museum?
What were the circumstances?
I have a full tank of gas.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.
A man is responsible for his deeds.
Would you like to try something new?
Redheads often have a pale complexion and freckles.
I want to dedicate all my time to this project.
I was tortured.
His story may not be true.
Thanks for your support.
How could it be?
Read the instructions carefully before you begin.
We have to start.
He must buy a new bicycle for his son.
You're surrounded.
They won't find it.
I want to know what you think.
How long was Tom there?
I am not well at all.
Sit wherever you like.
You're very observant.
I've already told Tom what needs to be done.
"Sorry, I seem to have confused you."
I'll never forget this.
I have plenty of friends.
Students arriving late will not be permitted to enter the hall.
This song is a love song.
That's actually a good idea.
It's a red herring.
Why don't we go dancing?
I've known Tom since I was thirteen.
Tom is a trucker.
He is still having doubts.
I don't want to wait that long.
How often do you go swimming?
Who's working tonight?
I hope it will clear up soon.
I promise that you won't regret it.
Go wake Tom up.
What do you want to tell us?
Tom speaks like an old man.
I'm batching it this weekend because my wife is visiting her brother in Frankfurt.
There is some evidence that taking several fish oil capsules per day could have beneficial effects on one's heart and blood pressure.
The girl had no one to turn to for advice.
There's no salad oil left.
We have to tell Tom before he hears it from someone else.
Tom went to a private boys' school.
I have nothing to say to any of you.
English isn't my first language.
We have faith in Tom.
Tom's apartment is spacious.
The ship will arrive by five o'clock.
You lead the way.
You look contented.
I'll always love you.
Excuse me. Who are you?
Don't look into the box.
You've been luckier than me.
Make it stop.
I didn't know you were so tired.
My father made a shelf for me.
It doesn't sound like Tom.
Could you put those bags in the car for me?
Are you pleased with your new job?
You have to do this now.
"I'll mail you the report in a jiffy, so you won't have to wait long."
I was just about to take a bath.
What would we do without Tom?
I know why you want this job.
I met Mary yesterday.
My income is twice as large as yours is.
She has already finished the work.
Give me a second chance.
They went surfing.
He's not one of us.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
You are both pretty and kind.
You don't have to be here.
The meaning of this letter is unclear.
It seems that you don't want me to succeed.
Those people over there are speaking French.
I asked Tom where he had gone for lunch.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
I can do this.
Tom was exhausted.
We had no choice but to call the police last night.
He knows very well how to deceive people.
Do you feel like eating something?
You lean on your parents too much. You must be more independent.
"Tom put his bags in the trunk, then hopped in the car and drove off."
She is not as beautiful as she was before.
You were handsome.
Naples is a picturesque city.
It's difficult to read kanji.
They complemented each other.
Tom fainted at the sight of the needle.
He hasn't left any message.
You cannot have your own way in everything.
His arrival pepped up the party.
I like this house as it is.
We can't help you unless you help us.
Tom saw the bus.
The old man sat all alone.
Tom promised me he'd buy me something to eat on the way home.
The alarm didn't wake Tom.
Tom's design is very original.
Where did the other one go?
Guess what that cost me.
Did you receive my package?
We have to conclude that the policy is a failure.
I brought mine. Did you bring yours?
It's very white.
I want to live in either Boston or Chicago.
Tom might have survived if the paramedics had gotten there faster.
My hotel told me to call you.
I'm very happy in Boston.
I'll be staying in a motel.
They spoke many different languages.
I will always remember you.
He's in the well.
I've always wanted to learn to play the drums.
Did Tom escape?
Why don't you give Tom a chance?
Speaking in public makes me nervous.
The policeman shot into the air.
Tom didn't have enough money to take a taxi.
Doesn't that look fun?
A man can be happy with any woman as long as he doesn't love her.
I was very disappointed at the news.
I had to run to catch up with Tom.
We have half a dozen eggs.
I hope you didn't lend Tom any money.
He leaned against the wall.
He always sings in the shower.
I saw something strange in the sky.
I am sick of his long speech.
We had hardly waited for five minutes when the bus came.
I can't see anything without my glasses.
This has my approval.
It was a question none of us could answer.
I don't believe Tom is a spy.
He told me how to play chess.
Would you please send me a catalogue by mail?
Are you going to sing?
Tom still isn't totally persuaded.
Make yourself at home.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
Do you really want to know what happened?
I already ordered.
Tom is thinking about buying that old restaurant on Park Street.
Enjoy your holidays.
He is a good speaker.
Make another appointment at the front desk.
I've asked myself that question a thousand times.
I think you will be impressed with the answers.
This bird cannot fly.
"Switzerland is situated between France, Italy, Austria and Germany."
He's always dissatisfied.
It was never my intention to hurt you.
They aren't twins.
I often go there to meditate.
Tom sat down next to Mary on the sandy beach.
I'd do it.
I told Mary that I just wanted to be friends.
Don't make me do this.
I can't go on like this.
You can't help Tom.
I am leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
Is this a sheep or a goat?
I'm on my lunch break.
It makes no difference whether you go or not.
I haven't yet graduated.
Does Europe have a common language?
"As far as I know, he's guilty."
She killed herself at the age of thirty.
Tom knows how to make Mary happy.
I always wondered what was in your attic.
Please don't change anything.
What time will you arrive tomorrow?
Tom is whining.
That makes me cry.
Turn the radio up a little.
"Excuse me, I didn't understand you."
Tom got nothing.
He sometimes comes to see me.
I hope we'll see Tom again.
Is she Japanese?
How old is the oldest one?
I've always been interested in botany.
I hope not.
I know you better than your wife does.
Tom doesn't like to hang out with people who smoke.
I am more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I am eating noodles.
"If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask."
Why are you so nice to everyone?
All the dogs are alive.
There's a sauna and a pool.
I can teach you how to fly.
They're about to go.
Tom knew Mary didn't know French.
We should take the necessary steps before it's too late.
I didn't want to tell you.
Does anyone oppose the new plan?
I worked in this company for three decades.
Our dorm's heating system isn't working properly.
The dam blocking the river is very wide.
Tom is learning French.
I am cleaning the kitchen.
I've seen your record.
I'm a father.
Where did you take your glasses off?
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived.
That's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it.
"It takes a lot of money to do that, doesn't it?"
You don't sound scared.
Science has not solved all the problems of life.
This rule does not apply.
You've grown up.
His name is known throughout this country.
Tom needs to update his website.
Was this somebody else's idea?
Tom knows why Mary is in Boston.
You look incredible.
Could this be love?
I'll do everything that I can.
He is afraid of his own shadow.
Ask me something easier.
He searched all day for the letter.
I should've done this a long time ago.
She misses her family a lot.
When did you change your address?
Do you like your car?
Few people speak my language.
When did it happen?
That road is still under construction.
He was not feeling well.
How much should they get?
This book should help you a lot.
What you are saying does not make sense.
There's a serious problem.
I am not always free on Sundays.
Why don't you leave him alone?
I've had a crush on you since I first saw you.
Tom isn't here now.
I've met you before.
It was a terrible affair.
Do you eat meat or are you a vegetarian?
We have to clear the snow from the roof.
I don't know if we can help Tom this time.
Tom had no right to do what he did.
Do you want me to call the police?
I got caught in a traffic jam on the expressway.
A noun can be singular or plural.
It's raining cats and dogs.
Tom gave Mary a drink.
He is a true gentleman.
This newspaper has no political slant.
I prefer apples to oranges.
Tom rode up in the elevator with Mary.
Do you think English is difficult?
What do you want to hear?
Don't you think that's a little strange?
Tom had to go there yesterday.
We must conform to the rules.
I have a lot of pencils.
Did you find anything in the room?
"Now that you're a college student, you should study harder."
I am laughing at you.
Tom chased after Mary.
It's a nice party.
We dug a hole in the ground.
I wonder what's wrong with the car.
How many carpenters do you know?
He joined the English club.
Get off my car.
Do you know who invented the microscope?
No one's here.
Do we have enough chairs?
Take Tom inside.
He had his car stolen in broad daylight.
I can't think of anything I'd rather do than go on a picnic with you.
Tom isn't as intelligent as you.
Tom has two sisters.
Tom didn't mean to hurt Mary's feelings.
He wants an iPad 4.
Tom is always hungry.
It is too warm for me.
Would you be so kind as to shut that window?
See you next week.
This house is large enough for your family to live in.
We need to do this.
"In the park, some sat on benches, and others strolled about."
Tom usually eats alone.
"Judging from what everyone says, it's the truth."
A lot of foreigners visit Japan every year.
It's not easy to speak a foreign language.
I like Tom very much.
He's accustomed to mountain climbing.
They'll probably come by car.
Tom became a police officer.
Tom broke out of jail.
That just goes to prove that you are a liar.
I would rather stay at home than go out in this hot weather.
Tom stared at Mary in astonishment.
"I had no more than 1,000 yen."
I wish it would happen more often.
I suggest you stay out of my way.
Try not to fall.
Come in already.
"Hey, how're you doing?"
Yanis hasn't arrived yet.
Wind up the clock.
Tom is the only one who smiled.
Tom's picture is on the front page of today's newspaper.
It looked like Mary wanted me to kiss her.
He does not care for ice cream.
Please do not leave your luggage unattended.
I know you're not serious.
Tom is fasting.
I still think Tom will win.
What'll you have to drink?
He impressed me with his magic tricks.
I got this job with my teacher's help.
Let Tom go home.
Never tell a lie!
Your mother must have been beautiful when she was young.
Tom asked me to speak to you.
Tom drinks beer every day.
Let's get inside.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
I will do anything but that.
Doesn't Tom ever do that?
Let's just pretend this didn't happen.
I love to swim.
I will join you.
You can go home now.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom married Mary's sister and Mary married Tom's brother.
Tom doesn't know why.
Tom and Mary picked some berries in the forest.
He is careless in everything.
I wonder what Tom's favorite color is.

Tom tried to start the car.
"At last, she hit on a good idea."
Tom smiled to himself.
We saw them leave.
I have never heard him speak ill of others.
Tom bought a camera to give to Mary on her birthday.
He's a hopeless case.
Tom bought Mary flowers.
Tom must not like Mary very much.
She hates him.
It was eighty meters long.
I know a man who speaks French.
I've only seen it once.
Tom shops online.
Tom doesn't blame Mary for getting angry.
I can get it from Tom.
What's wrong with him?
Tomorrow is my day off.
There are a lot of people here.
Tom has to have an operation on his back.
We could give it a try.
I know how angry you are.
It's not his style.
Do you have a bike?
I don't want to do anything risky.
You should consider the problem before coming to a decision.
Did you stop at the red light?
I don't have to listen to you.
Would you like to go for a swim with me?
"That's exactly like the original, a perfect copy."
"If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask."
Tom is outgoing.
Might I ask you a question?
Tom wants to know when you're coming home.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
We'll do it together.
Is he tall?
I'd rather not discuss it now.
My canary was killed by a cat.
We caught some large fish there.
It was a bold decision.
Whose bicycle is that?
Everyone around the area works hard.

You should do that soon.
That's not fair.

Tom is Mary's boyfriend.
I bought a new suit.
Tom left the house after eating lunch.
Tom and Mary looked at each other through the window.
What did he do yesterday?
She loves the child as if it were her own.
Tom looked sharp.
"He opened his mouth as if to speak, but didn't say anything."
It may be that he likes his job.
The story drew to a conclusion.
Look up this word in the dictionary.
He's been staying at that hotel for the past five days.
Don't you want to stop Tom?
How much longer can we keep Tom on life support?
It might rain before evening.
Air pollution is a serious problem in this country.

They come from the same village.

Tom has lost weight.
The pain was terrible.
I just found out that my boyfriend has been stepping out on me.
You don't seem to understand anything.
Tom doesn't obey his parents.
We're out of wine.
Today I love the entire world.
It's important.
I don't know where they hid the key.
Stop acting like a victim.
"In general, women tend to live ten years longer than men."
I'm able to speak.
Who believes in God?
I am a man who can't stand being alone.
I don't want Tom to think he has to interpret for me.
I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept.
Excuse me for a second.
He patted his brother on the shoulder.
I'm very happy with it.
Where should I park?
I'll meet you tomorrow.
Tom gave Mary some practical advice.
Tomorrow morning we're leaving Japan.
Don't insult me.
I was frustrated.
It'll take a week or so to read through this book.
Don't pick your nose.
You'll be plenty sorry.
I hate watching TV.
Do you know what Tom is up to?
This weighed heavily on my mind.
Are you talking about Tom or yourself?
He repaired my watch for me.
Let go of my arm!
Have you ever gotten food poisoning?
Your car's here.
Do you want small bills or large?
Tom rarely comes home so early.
We worry about your future.
Was Tom there?
It is rude to interrupt others.
I don't feel up to playing tennis right now.
Who said you could do that?
I've never won anything before.
They seem very busy.
"Tom was desperate to do that, but Mary wasn't."
I think it's not worth the risk.
I don't have it.
I suppose it can't be helped.
I'm going to run.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I think we can do that.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
Has Flight 123 been delayed?
Do you have this shirt in black?
"Can you take me to the airport, please?"
Tom turned a somersault.
Tom and Mary were sitting on a bench near the pond.
Do I owe you something?
Mary's biggest disappointment in life is not being able to have children.
Tom could hardly stand it.
Do you have any idea who could be behind this?
He knows how to plant palm trees.
I don't know how long it'll last.
I don't have enough time to eat.
Tom didn't know what else to say.
Tom wouldn't believe me.
He looked up at the stars.
Our next meeting will be held next on October 20th.
How are you coming?
I agree.
Thanks for your patience.
The worst-case scenario is that Tom will lose his job and won't be able to keep up his mortgage payments.
"Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end."
Why are you doing all this for us?
I don't know where Tom put his suitcase.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
I forgot my lunch and bought a sandwich at school.
He is not so much a scholar as a TV personality.
Which city are you going to visit first?
Tom noticed Mary hadn't even started to cook dinner.
He is old enough to drink.
I thought you said Tom wasn't a member of our club.
Would you like go out for a drink after work?
Our work here isn't done.
Tom hasn't had his lunch yet.
Put me in touch with her.
Can you tie a bow?
Don't I get a goodbye kiss?
I've fallen in love with somebody else.
This decision is final.
Why is it here?
It's your book.
"In German, nouns are always capitalised."
We'll take it with us.
Tom has lost his interest in studying French.
That isn't enough.
Did you put Tom up to it?
I don't speak Chinese.
It's a bargain.
It is easier than I thought.
Is it true that you can't swim?
Think about what I said.
I read your letter to my family.
Tom and Mary are always arguing about money.
It was chilly that day.
Why didn't you tell me you could speak French?

You had better go and speak to him in person.
Is this my life?
He crossed the street.
I'm counting how many people there are.

I don't play the oboe.
Tom was awesome.
"The American news is reporting that Hurricane Irene is as big as Europe, which is a bit of an exaggeration."
Can you tell me who they are?
He seems to have been rich.
Tom should've arrived by now.
I thought you'd wear something like that.
"Tom is married to Mary, isn't he?"
How was the math test?
Don't rely on what he says.
You didn't call me.

I don't want to cook.
Many weeds were growing among the flowers.

Both of them started laughing.
I don't like cats very much.
Who is your favorite TV star?
There's so much more to learn.
Is this your idea of fun?
I'm afraid I spilled coffee on the tablecloth.
That's the most absurd idea I've ever heard.
Let's do this properly.
His eyes flashed with anger.
"If anyone can do that, it's Tom."
He took a taxi both ways.
Please get these papers out of the way.
Therapy didn't work.
I'll buy it.
I haven't yet done what you said you wanted me to do.
It'll be hard to find someone to do that.
I think that would be fine.
Would you like some more orange juice?
Stop. You're making me blush.

I'll warn Tom.
I just couldn't sleep.
I dropped by just to say hello.

"If all goes to plan, I should be back home again tomorrow night."
Please remain seated until the bus comes to a complete stop.
Tom ought to stop doing that.
I don't see how Tom can stay up all night and then be so wide awake at work.
I wouldn't want to be a brain surgeon.
I'm not going to do that again.
Where have you been lately?
Tom was pleased.
Tom intended to tell Mary everything.
How long does it take to learn to play the xylophone?
Everything I said was true.
"This hall can hold 5,000 people."
There's something else you need to do before you go home.

He's an early bird.
I made Tom buy it for me.
She'll come at quarter past three.
I like jazz. What kind of music do you like?
Tom didn't even have the decency to acknowledge his mistake.
I prefer working alone.
It's all the rage.
Tom was standing near the entrance.
Tom was unscrupulous.
The unexpected always happens.
She should listen more to other people.
I used to swim here every day.
Why won't Tom listen to me?
I'm on good terms with him.
My eyes are watering.
He decided not to go.
Tom is a really bad singer.
"He loves his daughter, but his wife doesn't."
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
You should pay more attention to what you say.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
The mother was reluctant to leave her children alone.
I'll go with you as far as the bridge.
You hardly ate anything.
She shouldn't get carried away.
Cut it in half.
"This wouldn't be about Tom, would it?"
I want to hear you play the piano.
Try and stop me.
A man's worth has nothing to do with his appearance.
I drank coffee.
Tom whispered something to Mary that I couldn't hear.
Why does that interest you?
The museum is worth visiting.
It looks like he might win first prize.
Perhaps I'll like this book.
She is in a bad mood.
We can't wander around the park at night.
I'm not shy.
You don't realize how lucky you are.
Call your sisters.

Aren't you going to eat anything?
"Show me the photos, please."
This door will not open.
The export of weapons was prohibited.
Tom is totally into you.
It's against my morals.
I don't know Tom's last name.
I pledged my loyalty to him.
I think you're too picky.
"I had heard that he was fat, but I didn't think he would be that fat."

Tom keeps secrets.
Tom reminded Mary of John.
He got the first prize.
I take a walk every morning.

You cannot buy happiness.
Don't let him take pictures.
You should acquaint yourself with the local customs.
We have everything we want.
I hope you had a good night's sleep.
I am free till 6 o'clock this evening.

Tom likes pizza.
That would be funny.
I'd like to find out why Tom lied to me.
Tom and Mary said they were happy.
I knew you'd come back.
"Tom isn't always late, but he often is."
I have to go get Tom.
Tom deserves this.
Did you get a massage?
She lifted up her head and looked at him.
The handle of the cup is broken.
He can't buy a car.
Please sit down.
I have many friends I can talk to.
Tom blushed and turned away.
Divide the cake among the three of you.

Please cash this check.
I have been looking for you.
She burst into tears.
"Come on, it'll be fun."
Tom and his wife live separately.
Tom can't tell Mary his real feelings.

There may be some truth in your story.
I'm capable of dealing with problems like this myself.
Do you think your parents spent enough time with you when you were in your teens?
Tom is listening to Mary.
Tom hasn't received any messages.
He raised the glass to his lips and drained it at one gulp.
Could you lend me a hand?

My client never should've been arrested.
How many friends do you have on Facebook?
I can't understand his feelings.
Tom was strong.
Why do women hate you so much?
I permitted Tom to camp in our backyard.
Let's open it.
"How are you doing, Tom?"
Tom gave Mary a watch.
Which drinks don't you like?
Tom isn't patient enough to do something like that.
Please stop it.
He is my close friend.
She is having coffee now.
"We have a very good team, so we have every reason to be optimistic."
Tom is wanted for murder.
I lost something very important to me.
I think we're going on vacation in June.

Wait here for me.
You don't have to believe me.
Someone should put that dog out of its misery.

I'm not saying that what she did was right.
Tom probably doesn't know who did that.
Tom asked me if I were happy.
Pasteur experimented with bacteria.
Those children have no one to care for them.
I think we need more time.
I won't make the same mistake again.
Tom is no longer amused.
I had to climb over the wall.
He never fails to write to his mother every week.
We want a car.
Rabbits are related to beavers and squirrels.
We have a holiday today.
I have a girlfriend back home.
I am seeing a friend tomorrow.
Do you have a rice cooker at home?
I was just about to say that.
This is the priest who married them.
"I called her, but the line was busy."
None of this makes any sense.
Would you mind my opening the window?
Are you American or French?
I was a student at that time.
We parted the best of friends.
One of the kids broke the lock.
Maybe you should tell Tom that.
He used a fake I.D.
The proposal came up last week.
You're not to blame.
It's an ecological disaster.
I hope you're not planning on wearing that dress to the party.
He's asking you to help him.
The store is not open today.
That sofa is less expensive than this table.
I like to eat watermelon.
Tom almost cried.
Tom doesn't want one.
I'm still thinking about it.
The vice president represented his country at the international conference.
Mary is going to have a baby next month.
I wonder why Tom is alone.
"Where were you? ""I was at a friend's house."""
This wasn't an easy task.
Tom takes piano lessons.
"If you want to succeed in life, work hard."
He didn't get her joke.
How long are you going to stay in Japan?
I have a friend who went to school with Tom.
I have to cook the vegetables.
You can't keep me here.
I don't know what I'd do in that situation.
Blow out the candles.
You'll lose everything.
Tom doesn't want you to do that.
Do you feel better?
He stood by me whenever I was in trouble.
Tom isn't at school.
The Taj Mahal is beautiful.
They say there will be a general election this fall.
He was ignorant of the fact that the town had been destroyed.
Give me a little money.
The country is rich in natural resources.
Does he live here?
Tom said he didn't really know what to buy.
This is a lot more fun than studying.
Perhaps you'd better leave.
I would like to come and see you.
He wouldn't allow me to drive his car.
Tom's prayer was answered.
I was about to leave when the phone rang.
You had better not speak loudly in this room.
I can't speak either French or English.
Tom says that he can't eat any more.
Do you talk about us?
I wish Tom would come to Boston.
"If it were not for your help, I could not succeed."
You have to do it today.
What school do you go to?
"Large fries, please."
I think that rumor is true.
Tom is just trying to confuse you.
Tom asked for my help.
I guess Tom is looking for Mary.
There are things that women will never understand...
Would you care for more coffee?
The plane accident cost the lives of 200 people.
Tom read all the documents.
The thought hadn't occurred to me.
She turned off the lights.
Do whatever makes you happy.
I have no small change on me.
I'm looking for a bag for my wife.
What he said about England is true.
That guy annoys me.
She was always finding fault with me.
I think it'd be great if you could come.
The girl talking with Tom is Mary.
I'm very mindful of that.
The rumor is going around that the actress is going to get a divorce.
You're a very lucky man.
Good fences make good neighbors.
Tom is positive that he isn't wrong.
I had never been so scared before.
How did you get Tom to do that for you?
We want to live here.
Tom cheated.
Is it true that you complained to the principal?
He had to feed his large family.
Tom only managed to save a little money.
The audience applauded the actress.
Would you like a glass of water?
Tom ate nothing.
They hate us.
We're going to Boston to see Tom.
I am very interested in music.
Why do you want to study abroad?
The meat tastes bad.
I didn't hear how many times the clock struck.
Did Tom say why he wasn't coming?
"We'll miss you, Tom."
He survived the plane crash.
"When you've finished reading that book, I'd like to read it."
"Tom has long hair, which he wears in a ponytail."
We were prisoners.
I could not have done otherwise.
Tom tried to persuade Mary to do something she knew she shouldn't do.
They dashed water into my face.
Tom has a stiff neck.
He had three sons.
I bought a dictionary.
The radio is too loud. Turn the volume down.
"You need to pay a fee. ""What kind of fee?"""
"Show me a cheaper one, please."
I've only seen Tom once.
Tom sent a video to Mary.
The motel can accommodate as many as 400 guests.
I'm only the substitute teacher.
It was everything he hoped for.
I have two cars.
Tom is friendly.
Do you think Tom will permit us to do that?
I can't understand the meaning.
Tom had almost forgotten all about what had happened.
What was it that caused you to change your mind?
Tom is outrageous.
It sounds like you had a good time.
Is competition good for kids?
Tom is lying on his back.
"I've tried to get along with Tom, but it's impossible."
I don't like you either.
"It seems like you know me, but I don't know you."
The visitor asked the class a question.
Both of them are very cute.
He could die.
The waves are high.
What's so funny?
Tom has three children.
It's already happening.
It will be raining at this time tomorrow.
Why are you here?
I can't sleep.
I'm not a financial expert.
"My uncle is slim, but my aunt is fat."
I ran into an old friend of mine outside the station.
Tom took off his glasses and put them in his shirt pocket.
Tom is not famous.
That girl is Mary.
Ask him when the next plane will be.
I can't decide what to order.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
I was born and raised in Boston.
Cows give us milk and chickens give us eggs.
Tom knew.
"Sometimes, I feel like everyone is ignoring me."
I'll ask Tom to meet you tomorrow at three o'clock.
That girl looks like her mother.
Try again.
This book is small.
You're expected to be here by 2:30.
He has blue eyes and blond hair.
Do you think I'm too tall?
Tom has made a lot of new friends.
What does the cat want?
I won the lottery.
I believed every word he said.
He was absent from school yesterday because he was sick.
I like it this way.
I have absolute trust in you.
He won't be away for long.
What would you do if you had ten thousand dollars?
There are a lot of tall trees in the park.
Tom passed away recently.
Tom doesn't eat meat and neither does Mary.
Tom objected.
Tom didn't get everything he wanted.
She looks a lot like her mother.
Is it tasty?
Get lost!
This bank has many branches.
I'm sorry I called you a liar.
Tom teaches French.
You're really a hard worker.
I regret that decision.
I believe they're a perfect match.
Tom is not a member.
I don't want to open the window.
We need to burn all this stuff before the police get here.
I don't know where Tom came from.
Tom kept crawling.
"Three months before Tom was to graduate from college, he died."
She continued with the work.
Yesterday they fired seven employees.
He is photogenic.
He came back before eight.
She talks everything over with her parents.
Tom straightened up his desk.
Have we made any progress?
It's one of the stupidest things I've ever done.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom's wounds weren't self-inflicted.
Are you sure he can do this?
She woke him up.
The room was quiet.
The result was disappointing.
What can you teach me?
Do you have some dental floss?
I have no intention of asking him.
Why don't I go?
We're pretty busy right now.
Everyone has been there.
You let me down.
Where were your parents?
I almost died today.
The teacher spoke too fast for us to understand.
Tom had to wear a neck brace after Mary pushed him down the stairs.
You always said you wanted to learn French.
Tom can't handle this anymore.
You must study English hard.
Her hands were as cold as ice.
Tom ran back to the village.
He cares a lot about his reputation.
Rabbits like to eat carrots.
Her name is known all over the world.
I thought I'd left it at home.
My brother sends you his regards.
He spoke very well.
May I ask a question?
Tom reminds me of someone I used to know in high school.
He has a very vivid imagination.
You're going to pay for this.
You should talk this over before it gets to be too big a problem.
Tom went into the house.
A pilot guides the ship toward the port.
I didn't meet anyone.
Tom will be back by 2:30.
He's a southpaw.
I don't have all day.
We're going to listen to their new record together.
So far everything has been going well.
How do you spell your family name?
Hurry home.
The lock is beautiful.
This text is hard to read.
Whose is this book?
We have to memorize this poem by the next class.
Call 110 immediately.
You can't trust what she says.
That's how Tom did it.
Take me there.
That actually happened.
He confessed his crime.
I really appreciated it.
He knows that you know.
I hurt myself yesterday.
She is obstinate.
The mouse ran underneath the bed.
The thief fled without leaving any traces.
Tom said he was too drunk to help me do that.
You look different today.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
What are you getting?
Why would I do such a thing?
I have no backup plan.
Unlock the door.
I could fire you for that.
Tom can't afford to buy Mary anything nice.
You're wicked.
Leave that alone.
What did you hide?
Tom needs help nearly as badly as we do.
Could you check the tire pressure?
Kyoto is worth visiting.
We watched them play baseball.
Every minute counts.
Tom told everyone that he was exhausted.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
Turn to me for help if you are in difficulty.
I've never seen Tom so angry.
I met a nice woman.
I'm the one who taught Tom French.
Have you been busy recently?
Am I correct in assuming that you wish you hadn't done that?
I'd like to apply for a job.
He began to cry.
Tom may have said that.
My parents wouldn't let me do that.
Tom's a natural when it comes to games involving hand-eye coordination.
Don't trust anyone.
I put my hat on.
"On arriving home, I discovered the burglary."
I am still alone.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
I will have been studying English for five years next February.
"That's what you want, isn't it?"
We ran out of the building.
Are you in Boston right now?
Tom and Mary never kiss each other in public.
"As the room fall silent, only the ticking sound of an old clock could be heard."
"I want your opinion, too."
Are you even trying?
I wouldn't be the same without you.
I would buy him a beer.
He speaks Portuguese.
How dare you ask me for help!
Tom plans to major in biology.
Tom whistled a tune as he walked down the street.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
Show him in.
I know what you're probably thinking.
"Can you give me this one, please?"
The radio is on.
The laundry basket is full.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I'd like to ask you about a patient you treated.
I'm rather busy.
The students couldn't answer.
I'll come visit you tomorrow.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
"You wouldn't happen to have a knife on you, would you?"
Expect me when you see me.
It's you who doesn't understand.
That is exactly what I wanted to buy.
He can't do it.
Thank you for your trouble.
I love your sense of humor.
He is always trying to do the impossible.
Do you realize what declaring war entails?
Mine is black.
When was the last time you parked your car here?
I'll take the next train.
Time will show which of us is right.
I wonder what this phrase means.
I can't let my father down.
I'll explain it to Tom.
There are many books in my room.
Tom scares easy.
That made me cry.
Why didn't you come to yesterday's party?
She greeted us with a smile.
There's something she's not telling us.
I like raspberries.
I'm tired of backgammon.
He broke into a house.
Do you write in French?
"You can't say no to Tom, can you?"
I doubt that he can make a speech in public.
I haven't slept well recently.
You should have spoken more politely.
I don't think Tom is coming.
Did you lose your car keys?
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
Tom says he doesn't know when the meeting starts.
Tom picked up his toys.
How did you know that would happen?
Do you think Tom can be trusted?
I know exactly what you're thinking.
There is irrefutable proof that Tom is innocent.
Tom was up all night.
How much money does Tom owe you?
He doesn't speak my language.
I am pretty sure.
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
I'm not that stupid.
They set to work at once.
What are you guys doing?
Can you speak a little slower please?
Now I'm angry.
Tom said he was willing to pay up to $300.
Am I making sense?
Is there a toilet near here?
They're cousins.
Do people still actually use that word?
This is my room.
Don't you have anything to do?
This matter must be dealt with sooner or later.
Tom stayed calm.
Thank you for your invitation.
Are you being serious?
He's very fond of walking.
The road is too narrow for cars.
He trained very hard.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
I get a physical examination once a year.
Tom isn't the kind of person who blames others for his mistakes.
I really appreciate your cooperation.
Tom broke his leg skiing.
I never really felt comfortable there.
He read the article over and over again.
Tom and Mary bought an old farm.
Tom wrote Mary's phone number in his little black book.
Did you understand what he said?
One thing hasn't changed.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Nikko is situated about seventy five miles north of Tokyo.
Tom went to Boston to attend a conference.
"As a rule, twins have a lot in common."
In what year did the Berlin Wall fall?
Do you really want to have kids?
The enemy torpedoed our ship.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
Is a meal served on this flight?
I just ran into Tom in the cafeteria.
I want you home in time for dinner.
I can't live that kind of life.
What you're saying now has nothing to do with the question.
All humans on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.
Maybe I need a new assistant.
The patient is recovering from his illness.
She has totally changed her character.
Tom leaned out the window.
I am bored.
The moon is already out.
Tom hardly ever speaks to Mary anymore.
We still have plenty of time left.
"You have a dog, don't you?"
I can't read French.
I'm in denial.
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
He has to stay in bed.
I think Tom isn't right.
My face twitches.
When is the next train to Sloane Square?
He couldn't concentrate on the conversation.
Are you able to tell the difference between butter and margarine?
Tom gave me advice.
My horse ran away.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
I just sang a couple of songs with Tom.
"Do you agree, Tom?"
Have you heard this story already?
I think Tom said he was from Boston.
When was she born?
They tried to hide what was really going on.
Tom is arriving soon. You should get ready.
Tom's enthusiasm is contagious.
William the Conqueror occupied England in 1066.
Could you pass me the salt?
I'm fed up with eating in restaurants.
Tom is scared.
I'm only following orders.
He speaks really well.
I'd like to study French.
I hope you get well soon.
Tom looked up at the sky.
He's already a man.
My cat had a fight with another cat.
It's an extreme case.
The plumber used many different tools to fix our sink.
I'll stand guard now. Go get some sleep.
This microscope magnifies objects by 100 times.
I was not pleased by your rude behavior.
Tom is going to show us the documents this afternoon.
The baby appears hungry all the time.
I would rather not go shopping alone.
I'll show you the way.
Who is this pretty girl?
Tom confessed right away.
That was a much happier time.
"Compared to Tokyo, London is small."
I don't want to fight with you.
"It's a beautiful day for a hike, isn't it?"
I'll be here.
What are you thinking?
We're the same age.
Tom pulled Mary out of the pool.
Tom is actually only thirteen years old.
I'm coming for Tom.
Tom seems pleased.
This is where the fun begins.
I love you more than I love her.
That chicken hasn't laid any eggs lately.
Tom likes his new car.
The storm continued.
Where did I put it?
These colors don't match well.
I suppose he'll come.
What time's Tom picking you up?
Why would Tom want to kill anyone?
Can you please repeat the question?
The problem is not so much the cost as the time.
He knocked his knee against the chair.
Please put these flowers in the basket.
I'm a regular at a restaurant in this neighborhood. Let's have lunch there today.
Are you waiting for anybody?
I know that you live here.
Tom will be upset when he finds out that Mary forgot to pay the rent.
Tom is going to like that.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Maybe we need to get a watchdog.
You're going to ruin your eyes.
He has no remorse.
Did you enjoy the salad?
We missed our plane because of the traffic jam.
Tom isn't in a joking mood.
Let me show you how to do that.
"If students today had more free time, they might show more interest in politics."
How did the party go?
There's so much left for me to learn.
I'm good at that.
There's no need for threats.
Don't you miss your father?
She stayed there for a moment.
It's Tom's fight.
Tom remained seated.
Tom still loves Mary even though she doesn't love him anymore.
Speaking English is not easy.
I made a wrong turn.
It is always difficult for a son to live up to the expectations of his parents.
Life is fun.
Tom and I are the only ones who survived the accident.
It's possible Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
She accepted our invitation.
It is dark outside.
There must be a logical explanation for this.
"We're one big, happy family."
You're in trouble.
Tom's an extremely honest person.
He talked to himself.
Did you go to London that day?
Tom called a cab for Mary.
We're unhappy.
He made a mistake and drank poison.
Her teacher advised her to read more and more novels.
I expect him to come at any moment.
"Death is certain, only the time is not certain."
There was nobody there.
That doesn't happen.
It has to be done.
She is everything to him.
He is not honest at all.
This is standard procedure.
Tom lives on the same street as Mary.
Help!
I got this book for nothing.
"He seldom, if ever, goes to the movies."
My vet recommended euthanizing my dog.
Don't be ridiculous!
The bell had already rung when I got to school.
Tell Tom I have to work late tonight.
Have you already carried the boxes up to the attic?
Why aren't you at home?
Tom said that he didn't know that Mary wasn't able to speak French very well.
I'm a free man.
How did you spend your holiday?
Tom has something in his suitcase for Mary.
You should be ashamed.
Tom peeked inside the room.
Tom has strong hands.
This isn't news.
Sixty percent of Japanese adult males drink alcoholic beverages on a regular basis.
"Come on, I'll give you a ride home."
The riot was put down.
Did you remember to buy candles?
He will do his best to finish it on time.
Do it with me.
I think I might be able to speak French better than Tom.
I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.
He was dazzled by her beauty.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
I can hear Tom playing guitar in his bedroom.
I felt much more relaxed.
She is a good dancer.
Tom says he saw someone climbing over the fence.
I've just turned 20.
I feel terrible about ruining your party.
That boy is really shy.
This dress looks good on you.
There is a really good restaurant just off the beach that I think you'd enjoy.
How much is the ticket?
Tom knew who Mary was planning to marry.
The garden is in front of the house.
I think I know what to do.
This doesn't burn.
It's obvious that he lied.
Do you have enough money to buy everything you need?
Do you think that's true?
Please do something.
Tom has lived alone ever since his wife died.
She became a police officer.
I hope she's safe.
Where's the nearest subway station?
Do we have one?
The garbage collector comes three times a week.
"Tom, there are a lot of girls that would love to go out with you."
Coal is not always black.
I'll see if Tom wants to come over.
Tom is a communist.
Please play it back for me after you've finished the recording.
All you have to do is wash the dishes.
Could you please wait just couple of minutes?
I hope you get well soon.
"Excuse me, but I believe that's my seat."
You were right and I was wrong.
See you.
How long has Tom studied French?
A lot of companies are going under lately because banks are so tight with their money.
He seldom gets angry or irritated.
This was a lie.
I was invited.
I was surprised to see you here.
Tom and Mary hurried up the steps together.
I thought maybe you could tell me what I need to know.
"You like him, don't you?"
Tom was assessed by the selection committee as fully meeting all criteria for the job.
"I tried again and again, but I couldn't succeed."
How can you tell?
It hurt really bad.
Tom quickly went up the stairs.
I don't know what we'll do.
Please drink the beer before it goes flat.
I work at the post office.
That's true.
It is not easy to learn a foreign language.
How do you stop this?
The dog was so clever that he seemed almost human.
She likes to eat fresh raw vegetables.
We enjoyed playing football.
You never know what you can accomplish until you try.
Stay there a little longer.
Were you speeding?
That might be true.
"My father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather all had the same name as I have."
It's my book.
You are very brave.
We shouldn't have done that.
We should head home.
What do you know about Mary's boyfriend?
I don't like your boss.
She does not have a ticket.
Are you important?
You may use my typewriter.
We have no idea about his whereabouts.
I was taken to a circus for the first time.
I should've told Tom.
I had my bicycle stolen.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Tom looked up.
Tom is overweight.
I was puzzled about what to do next.
"Tom bought an expensive toy for his young son, who then proceeded to spend hours playing with the box it came in."
I never got along with Tom.
Close the door behind you.
"Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year."
Tom needed space.
Tom videotaped it.
Many houses were damaged beyond repair in the flood.
How did Tom and Mary meet?
"Someone said something, but I could not understand it."
The soup's very hot.
Tom is in.
Does Tom still owe you money?
Tom predicted that would happen.
I guess you don't recognize me.
This man is not reliable.
"The minute I entered the room, they stopped talking."
I need to get a job.
"The first time Tom brought Mary home, his mother said, ""This one's a keeper."""
You should not give your children everything they want.
Hardly anyone thinks that we are sisters.
It happened more than three days ago.
Tom was reading a letter written in French.
He left for no reason whatsoever.
"Nickel is a hard, silver-white metal."
Tom thinks Mary isn't here.
I got my son to repair the door.
I'll be in the country two weeks.
No one speaks this language anymore.
Tom is hardworking and dependable.
They came here one after another.
Tom doesn't live far from here.
He plays tennis three times a week.
We did not think about the price.
Take a bus.
"You aren't going to tell my parents, are you?"
He described exactly what happened.
"He was sick, but he went to school."
Tom and Mary don't get along. They have nothing in common.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
I don't want Tom to know. This has to be our secret.
Stop messing around.
Tom has to take medicine every three hours.
I think Tom's homemade cookies are better than the ones Mary makes.
Is there a barber shop in the hotel?
Find an empty bottle and fill it with water.
"As to your final grade, that depends on your final examination."
Parties are fun.
What are you crying for?
"At any rate, we can't change the schedule."
Have you gotten used to living in the dorm?
Don't add too much salt.
Tom wasn't the one who borrowed my car.
Will you join us?
Your account is empty.
The refugees felt safe in their new country.
Tom didn't have enough time to eat lunch.
Here's a picture of me.
I can't open the door.
You're so weird.
My father plays tennis every Sunday.
I wonder who the people I saw her with were.
"If Tom doesn't eat this, please give it to Mary."
"Not having seen him before, I'll not be able to recognize him."
There were two left.
Tom and Mary struggled to make ends meet.
It's all very simple.
What do you want me to see?
Everyone is going to call me a liar.
Tom is like family.
You're a really bad listener.
Tom is a cold-blooded murderer.
I've come here to study Chinese.
She thanked him with all her heart.
I didn't drink tea yesterday.
Tom is a few months older than Mary.
That poor family survives on food stamps.
Is Tom dreaming?
You should have seen it.
I grew these carrots myself.
Let me know if you need help.
I want to change my life.
Quite a few students are absent today.
Tell Tom to get back here as soon as he can.
Yesterday he came back late.
"It's my CD, isn't it?"
Can you stand?
The man dashed the bottle against the wall.
The noise continued for several hours.
I may be a bit crazy.
I have a classmate who says he can speak French fluently.
The snow has begun melting.
What's Tom going to do about this?
This is the village where I was born.
I doubt the new proposal will be accepted.
My friend has a large family.
"In my opinion, Tom is innocent."
He will be missed.
She decided to resign.
He returned home without telling us.
I still love him.
President Jackson called a cabinet meeting.
You make me happy.
The room emptied when the gong for dinner sounded.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Everything depends upon your decision.
Tom doesn't work anymore.
The game became exciting.
Come off it!
I don't care what Tom does.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Tom cheats.
"Even during work, I secretly indulge my Internet addiction."
Do you know what Tom's favorite food is?
Tom wanted Mary to learn French.
This movie is really scary.
Tom will improve.
I'm not interested in anything Tom has to say.
Tom is still in shock.
Where do you watch television?
I would like to visit New York.
"I'm to blame, not you."
What took Tom so long?
Mary is lying to her father.
"I listened for a long time, but I didn't hear anything."
It seems as if everything he touches turns to gold.
You said it!
Did you know that Tom almost married Mary?
My father is a proud man.
Tom is in a meeting right now.
Tom may not be as good at French as you think.
I'll be back at seven o'clock.
Will you do it for me?
We must leave early.
I don't say it without reason.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
I don't want Tom to move to Australia.
I want you to read this book.
The loan bears an 8% interest.
I thought you'd left.
What languages are spoken in Canada?
Tell us about your family.
I can't ignore that.
He makes life miserable for everyone around him.
They laughed quietly.
What difference does this make?
Tom should've helped Mary with her homework.
Death is everyone's fate.
Luckily nobody got injured.
I put the meat we just bought in the freezer.
Almost all the students believed the rumor.
The earth gave out under his feet.
Tom plans to buy a new motorcycle.
Tom realized that Mary was tired.
He's right behind you.
I love to see you smile.
Why don't we just reformat the hard disk? You've been having a lot of trouble with it.
Tom is looking at Mary.
We've got less than three minutes.
I would've done anything.
What do your friends call you?
I like talking about Australia.
I don't go in for that sort of thing.
He visited France three times.
Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
It's past your bedtime.
We'll go to the lake to have lunch.
Everyone started laughing.
I'm very glad to see you.
Her doctor wants to refer her to a specialist.
Your parents must be so proud of you.
I don't know what Tom saw.
I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
The most dangerous thing Tom ever wanted to try to do was to hold a poisonous snake.
"If you have any questions, please let me know."
What you say does not make any sense to me.
She gave him a book.
What does Tom's new car look like?
Take away this box.
I have brothers.
When do I get to meet Tom?
"Tom, do you still love me?"
That was an awful day.
I waited for ten minutes.
You're my friends.
Are you breaking up with me?
"After his father's death, Tom started drinking heavily."
What in the world happened here?
Do you know where it is?
Maybe that won't be necessary.
I'm not going to do this.
He cried and cried.
My cat is following me.
We should follow his example.
I like your car.
"Sorry, I've got to go."
This brings back memories.
Who's your favorite person to cook for?
I am tired and I want to go to bed.
Are you injured?
Were there any problems?
She has never gone on a date with him.
You must not kill.
Tom has been absent from school for three days.
The English established colonies in America in 1609.
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I take the bus to work every day.
Did Tom say what happened exactly?
"You don't get up as early as your older sister, do you?"
I'm not being paid for this.
Everything went well with him.
You're double-parked.
I'm no longer hungry.
He is my teacher.
Aren't you going to finish your supper?
I can do that right now.
"Marcy burst into tears on hearing the news, but soon pulled herself together."
I know very little about him.
We are thinking of buying some new furniture.
What kind of threat do terrorists really pose?
I had a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
That's for you.
This is a bird sanctuary.
Tom fell asleep in class.
All the houses on my street lost power this morning due to the storm.
Tom isn't going to stop Mary.
Don't blame others for your mistakes.
"A tsunami is coming, so please be on the alert."
I hope we can make it to your party.
I haven't told Tom anything.
Tom and Mary are in Tom's car.
The animal struggled to get out of the cage.
I'll cook bacon and eggs.
There's something fishy going on.
Tom decided to tell Mary the truth.
You have the right to be creative.
He was arrested for murder.
Go on ahead. I'll catch up with you soon.
I can't just leave you here.
He dropped the cup and broke it.
I think we should wait another half an hour.
How did you see that?
Tom found out the truth from Mary.
"Tom gave Mary a box of chocolates, and then ate all the chocolates himself."
The sun doesn't always shine.
"Do you think you can do that, Tom?"
He shook hands with the mayor.
Tom and Mary walked down the street holding hands.
We went to London last year.
He buys and sells leather goods.
I'm looking for a part-time job.
I came into a huge fortune.
We will never do it again.
I have to write a letter.
She is in a very good mood.
I just don't trust Tom.
Tom called Mary to see how she was doing.
We're in the process of writing the report now.
Are you an only child?
No one is perfect.
I read a book today.
I'm still not married.
I'm not frightened of anything.
What do you feel most proud of?
My back still hurts.
Tom wasn't afraid of death.
I want to tell you about Tom.
I just don't get it.
Tom is a yoga instructor.
Look there.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
Tom never thought about the future.
Tom says he's tired.
"If Tom spoke a little slower, people would be able to understand him better."
Where did you find the keys?
"Can you pay attention, please?"
Tom is banned from entering this building.
He's a friend from work.
We traveled to Mexico by plane.
Tom has his own bedroom.
Who did you go to the beach with?
Do you know who you’re talking to?
You have to choose between honor and death.
My eyes are very sensitive to the light.
How many books are in your library?
What do you guys think?
You must promise not to tell anyone.
I really want to know what's happening here.
My father got me to wash the car.
Tom is quite inflexible.
Why is Tom so busy?
He is a lazy student.
Tom never breaks promises.
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you something at the supermarket?
Did you get in touch with Tom?
Tom called me a scaredy-cat.
Tom said he was glad that he did that.
What's your favorite cheese to eat when drinking wine?
I was badly in need of his help at that time.
Tom grew up in a working-class family.
He promised he would help us.
He's very jealous of his wife.
I'm sure you're sleepy.
Tom was looking through some papers.
This car handles very easily.
I just figured out what the problem is.
This should be clear to everyone.
Let me handle Tom.
He's my hero.
"Fill it up, please."
The soup is a bit too salty.
"In case of fire, break this window."
"You can't leave yet, Tom."
Tom gave me a bicycle.
Myanmar is ruled by a military dictatorship.
Tom's shirt wasn't ironed and he'd forgotten to comb his hair.
Hands off.
It won't be as fun as you think.
You look European.
What are you doing in Brazil?
Wake me up early tomorrow morning.
Please allow me to say a few words on this occasion.
I'll have something for you soon.
She still loves him.
She didn't pay back the money.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow. I'm going to take it easy.
Tom gets home every Monday at about 2:30.
It's bulky.
You are tallest.
I'm not afraid anymore.
I promised Tom I'd help him.
You won't need an umbrella today.
He behaved like a child.
Tom told Mary he didn't want to see her anymore.
Tom is a rookie.
"I know you're busy, too."
He was hurt in the accident.
I can speak neither French nor English.
She stood close to him.
It has been raining since Tuesday.
"At last, the baby fell asleep."
What do you think happened here?
She took to her new teacher.
That's really sweet.
The situation is getting worse every day.
You could've won the race if you'd run just a little bit faster.
We have walked all around the lake.
Am I confusing you?
Why did they arrest him?
Tom was a real hero.
Why do Americans eat turkey on Thanksgiving?
A typhoon prevented us from going on our trip to Okinawa.
Most Americans have a sense of humor.
I love my yellow sweater.
I want vengeance.
See you in two days.
I'll follow you anywhere.
Tom is a bachelor.
Making cheese is an art.
It happened at a quarter past eleven.
Be brave.
"They haven't yet resolved their problems, but at least they're discussing them."
We can't last long in this heat.
"Yesterday, as I was walking along the street, I saw an accident."
She put the blanket over the child sleeping on the sofa.
I thought you were in prison.
Tom eyes widened.
Don't forget your stuff.
I can run.
The game ended in a free-for-all.
Tom sat nearby.
You have too many books on the shelf.
I don't think this shirt goes with that red tie.
She's already rich even though she's only 26 years old.
Who goes there?
Tom has been dead for three years.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
I just hope no one saw me.
That's an odd request.
He secretly showed me her photo.
Thanks for the memories.
We knew this.
I can teach you how to repair a computer.
What's the difference between a star and a planet?
The thieves opened the door with a pass key.
Tom is amusing.
She is eighteen at most.
"Come on, let's go."
Tom knows what he wants to say.
We cannot afford it.
Tom went skiing.
"Without your help, we wouldn't be able to carry out our plan."
"Our children like dogs, but I prefer cats."
I'll never forget the look on Tom's face.
You're nuts!
It's a stupid idea.
Most people brush their teeth at least two times a day.
You can't prove a thing.
Tom pushed Mary into the room and closed the door.
What a beautiful night!
Are you looking for something specific?
He is not scared of snakes at all.
A bad cold caused the singer to lose his voice.
"When I go on vacation, I'll rent a car."
I have kept a diary in English these ten years.
What did you want to talk to me about?
A person cannot understand another person completely.
Tom was home.
The man sitting on that bench is Tom.
They slept in a barn.
These are very big apples.
Why am I still here?
The building collapsed in the earthquake.
They tried to swim to safety.
It's not true anymore.
They held a party in honor of the famous scientist.
Mary slapped Tom.
Do you think it's a good idea to feed your dog table scraps?
Tom lay awake for a long time thinking about Mary.
I thought that Tom was married.
I run ten kilometers a day.
I wanted to retire three years ago.
I'm not your enemy.
Maybe Tom was just trying to help you.
This is the best movie I've ever seen.
Your cat is driving me crazy.
Tom seems OK now.
You deserved it.
This is my decision.
Where are the crocodiles?
He got tired soon.
We're on our way home.
I think I know as much as you do.
The Swallows are ahead 4 to 1!
Thank you ever so much.
Tom has a guitar.
He drank it in one gulp.
I'm going to report you to police.
I think I'll come back soon.
The door locks automatically.
He forgot my birthday.
I've made the change I was advised to make.
Tom removed his wet socks.
I'm fairly certain that Tom will pass today's exam.
Let me write it down so I don't forget.
I don't know how to do anything else.
I think I'm OK.
You must study hard.
Could you suggest a good beauty parlor near here?
Give Tom everything he asks for.
She is probably over forty.
This was Tom's idea.
Tom knows that he has to do that.
Here you are.
Don't touch that.
Tom has changed so much that I don't think you'd recognize him if you saw him.
Are you sure about this?
She spoke up for him.
Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud.
Are you sure you're not tired?
They are all in a hurry to catch a train.
He moved to Tokyo last month.
We live in peace.
You're impatient.
Please don't ask me about this again.
Teach me how you do it.
I think Tom will win.
I can't let that happen.
Please take off your shoes at the door.
Do you often travel abroad?
Tom almost always gets home from school before 5:30.
Tom and Mary reminisced about the old days.
I know it's a lie.
Tom scolded Mary for not calling to say she'd be late.
What kind of American accent does Tom have?
He's new in town.
Who is your friend?
Where is the nearest bank?
Did Tom forgive you for what you did last week?
Don't worry about the results.
That's why he lost his job.
Tom didn't want me to touch him.
Tom doesn't know what to order.
I'm glad to see you enjoy your work so much.
"According to the police, no one was injured."
Somebody poisoned Tom.
Tom said that he thought that the statue weighed about 300 pounds.
I'm reading the newspaper.
Tom is living in Boston.
"May I have a glass of milk, please?"
It is necessary that you see a doctor.
They love Tom.
I'd like to ask you the same question once more.
It didn't happen the way you said it did.
"At last, my wish has come true."
"Even though he was sick, he went to school."
You speak French very well. I wish I could speak it as well as you.
I have a hangover today.
She looked happy in her new dress.
Think before you leap.
Tom may come tomorrow morning.
That's perfectly obvious.
Play it cool.
"Judging from his appearance, he is sick."
I'll do what I have to do.
You can't leave us here.
Don't believe everything you read.
I've decided to become an engineer.
I think I might be able to be there by 2:30.
We are in need of some food.
It's useless to deny it.
"If you're not careful, you'll make a mistake again."
What's your last name?
Today is Monday.
I'm not a fanatic.
"To me, it is important."
"You guys love each other, right?"
I found something I thought I'd lost.
He removed his sunglasses.
We need to talk.
I stretched out my hand for the book.
The news that the president was killed surprised them.
Do you want something to eat?
Do you want to leave now?
Why are you asking me?
He has a long nose.
Tom is pruning the trees.
She did without necessities to pay for her daughter's lessons.
Tom has lots of things to tell Mary.
Tom will say yes.
This can't be right.
How do we know that he's innocent?
My mom bought me this toy when I was eight years old.
Tom only eats raw food.
"What's wrong with you, Tom?"
The bartender came out from behind the counter to stop the fight.
Lincoln was sad that he had not won.
Tom said that he thought it would be possible to do that.
That's weird.
That car is quite new.
This is such an easy problem that any student can solve it.
Where's my cup?
Tom looked up at the ceiling.
It's no laughing matter.
Do you want my email address?
I'll only be staying a few days.
It's not a competition.
Will you tell him I called?
She was in such a hurry that she left her umbrella behind on the train.
I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.
"You can play a musical instrument, can't you?"
Thank you for calling me on time.
You won't believe it.
I know a very good way to get it done.
"If only she had known I was in Tokyo, she would have come to visit me."
Tom tried to trick us.
She has a passion for cake.
Someone screamed.
I wonder if he's at home.
Tom says he always told Mary the truth.
Tom says it's an emergency.
Tom was killed in the avalanche.
I wonder if he will come.
Tom is a corrections officer.
It works pretty well here.
"Who is in the car? ""Tom is."""
Tom is just pretending to be your friend.
Do you do that often?
I think Tom is just looking for a little attention.
I'll call you.
Tom always said he wanted to learn how to play mahjong.
I've received a circular from the bank.
"As soon as Tom heard the gunshots, he ran out of the house."
"At last, the day has arrived for us to act."
Don't cry.
Novels aren't being read as much as they were in the past.
You're the best brother in the whole world.
Mary knitted Tom a sweater for his birthday.
Tom isn't home.
One of Tom's friends was killed in a traffic accident.
"You're not much of a talker, are you?"
I glanced at his letter.
That's a nice brooch.
There is a piano in the room.
Our electricity was cut off because we forgot to pay the bill.
Do you live around here?
It can be frustrating.
The coup attempt was foiled at the last moment.
You should eat more fruit.
Let us never speak of this again.
We want to measure your blood pressure.
Everyone says that he's a good man.
Tom isn't a student here.
"If you had left earlier, you would have caught the train."
I am online.
Tom was fed up with having to repeat himself all the time.
Do you think that will change anything?
I regret having said that to him.
I can teach you how to fight.
I understand.
Tom didn't leave.
Tom is writing a book about his father.
I can't remember the secret code.
I thought the game was over.
Could you come back a little later?
It is time for her to go home.
Her vital signs are being closely monitored.
"I am going to my room, where I can study."
He is what is called a self-made man.
I little dreamed of seeing you here.
This isn't about you.
Tom bought a newspaper.
They supplied the villagers with food.
This book is available at one shop only.
Why are you in such a bad mood today?
You're not getting it.
Tom was very popular.
I'm going to work by bicycle.
You give me so much.
They said no.
I have no more than one thousand yen.
Tom listens to me.
It's really dark here. I can't see anything.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
I'm pretty sure I'll pass the test tomorrow.
Tom is up there waiting for you.
I don't like beer.
I thought you were going to talk to Tom about it.
"The girl, closing her eyes, listened to the pastor."
I'm not making this up.
That's not what Tom wants you to do.
It's gorgeous.
This medicine will take care of your headache.
These shoes don't fit.
Is Tom a good cook?
"He did not go out, but sat down."
Tom wouldn't have given this to me if it weren't something important.
I didn't think my day could get any worse.
He owns a lot of land.
You're a rich man.
I talked my wife out of buying a new carpet.
Don't touch me!
This is the reason why he did it.
Tom said he wanted me to spend the summer in Boston with him.
You were the one who told me Tom couldn't be trusted.
"I understand that Tom is on a tight schedule, but I'd really appreciate it if I could get an appointment with him."
I don't feel like going out for a walk.
These cameras are made in Japan.
I don't understand you at all.
I don't need your protection.
Are any seats still available?
He is an English teacher.
Tom's eyes are larger than his belly.
We found out recently that some foxes live here on this mountain.
He telephoned her when he arrived at the station.
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
The report is utterly false.
Tom doesn't like chess.
I have a splendid idea.
Tom doesn't like to speak in public.
You need to get off at the next stop.
I don't think much of him as a musician.
Were you really that worried about me?
Why don't you have any clothes on?
Please find Tom.
The bride looked very beautiful.
He explained how to make a fire.
Would you be kind enough to explain it to me?
Barely a third of the population in this country have access to the Internet.
An honorable death is better than a shameful life.
I saw a man knocked down by a car.
Tom isn't going to know.
Could you tell me how to get to your office?
Won't you sample some of my wine?
Tom couldn't swim.
He died at the age of seventy.
Let me ask you a simple question.
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
I love Mary.
Tom wants revenge.
It is completely natural for her to be mad.
Now I realize why.
The typhoon caused the river to flood.
Why are you down here?
Beware of the dog!
I can't swim any further.
Have you been to any of the places on this list?
Tom glanced back.
Let's get this meeting over with.
He was born to be a painter.
It was his wish to go to Paris.
"Oh, don't worry about that."
Tom has never really tried very hard to win.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
I think it's time for me to call it a day.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
The wind is cold today.
Tom asked a few questions that Mary didn't want to answer.
You took advantage of me.
It is usually the islander who sees the mainland most clearly.
Tom has a learning disorder.
Tom says he likes it.
My father is getting bald.
Would you like me to help you with washing the dishes?
I don't know how to drive.
I never break a promise.
We've got to make a choice.
I'd like you to come with us.
I won't say anything.
"Help yourself, please."
I discovered a very nice place today.
Tom can barely make ends meet.
"Suddenly, she stopped and looked around."
Give up smoking if you want to live long.
Tom thought the car Mary was driving wasn't safe.
I spent the whole day in the library.
The reception isn't good.
Tom is hard of hearing.
Aren't you working today?
He still wants to come.
Tom didn't like the situation.
I refuse to discuss the question.
Tom got into his car and drove off.
You promised that Tom would be here.
I'm giving it to you for free.
Tom's wounded.
I assume you still live in Boston.
You can go home now if you like.
"On a first date, it's best to steer clear of touchy subjects."
Tom always sits in the back of the classroom.
Watch us.
It gets better.
I know that you still think about me.
Tom is playing with his yo-yo.
It was not easy for us to find his house.
You're making the biggest mistake of your life.
"Don't worry, Mom. He isn't particular about food. He eats anything."
I wish you were here with me.
Tom is in need of help.
Even Tom doesn't do that anymore.
I have a severe headache.
I don't want to hurt her.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
See you at two this afternoon.
He has no trouble climbing trees.
I couldn't come because of the rain.
Let's do what Tom wishes.
I'm just cleaning up.
I'm glad to see you here.
Is this your first visit to Japan?
The milk froze and became solid.
People used to think that was true.
Let's get ready for lunch.
I feel like Tom is using me.
The room is full of people.
My homeroom teacher is the same age as my mother.
Tom ate the apple that Mary had left on the dining room table.
I'll leave you alone now.
Let's look upstairs.
We're about thirty minutes behind schedule.
Don't you have any money?
Tom pulled his gun out of its holster.
"Tom's mother used to wash his clothes for him, but now he washes them himself."
Do you have any pencils?
I wanted to talk to you anyway.
Maybe you should tell Tom that.
Please read between the lines.
You can't keep hiding from the truth.
Should I wash the lettuce?
We'll miss Tom.
What's that building behind the hospital?
"If you have something to say, say it."
"In Christianity, Jesus is believed to be the son of God."
He died when he was 54 years old.
She's been learning German for a year now.
I walked to school.
"The card was valid until January, 2006."
Tom said that he didn't know Mary could speak French.
May I go home now?
We help the poor.
"Which do you like better, skating or skiing?"
What time did the meeting end?
I don't have a house anymore.
I've spent my whole life trying to help others.
Tom was arrested for theft.
She isn't afraid of death.
Tell me where I can find Tom.
I'm not her type.
Could you come over and help me this afternoon?
Follow me.
Tom was embarrassed.
It's Tom's profile.
I knew that today would be fun.
"I have been typing this report since this morning, but I'm only halfway through."
Tom drank heavily.
You're my child.
The soup is cold.
We'd better go help Tom.
You don't look very happy.
I need to purchase health insurance.
I get by.
Tom told me to leave the room immediately.
Why do you keep calling me Tom?
I don't have enemies.
"If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me."
Tom is a great player.
What part of Canada are you from?
There seem to be few people who can solve that math problem.
What made her do that?
"If a brain can do it, a computer can do it."
They're cold.
I'm fat.
I started studying French three years ago.
Tom tried to help Mary up the steps.
That was just plain stupid.
We have a few questions for you.
Tom almost never eats breakfast.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
We are bound to each other by a close friendship.
Tom insulted Mary.
What did Tom really mean by that?
The lion is often used as a symbol of courage.
It is raining.
My friend says that she's suicidal.
"Feel free to disagree, Tom."
Tom asked me if I knew anybody who could translate from French into English.
Give me the knife.
Tom plays tennis.
Tom is a wimp.
I can pick you up at the airport if you like.
"So, what do you find so interesting about dinosaurs?"
"Tom is scared, but Mary isn't."
Is it a butterfly or a moth?
Tom wanted to talk to me about something.
Stop bad mouthing Tom.
I'm never going to do what you're asking me to do.
Tom discussed the problem with Mary.
Please be patient.
You're up early.
This area is off-limits.
Where have they gone?
I promise you I won't ever leave you.
I don't think Tom is the only one who doesn't have enough money to buy a ticket.
Look at this picture.
"By the way, where are you from?"
Please tell me the answer to the question.
I'll try again.
Let's turn back.
She helped him.
Tom had a knife.
Did Tom go home?
You can't end our relationship this way.
I hope that he will help me.
We're not listening.
We keep in touch.
Tom disappeared in the crowd.
"When I grow up, I want to be just like you."
Her skin is whiter than snow.
I've been looking for them for more than one hour.
Tom lost his French textbook.
Tom prefers not to talk about it.
The police found Tom dead on the porch.
Tom made a loose translation from the original.
"As you know, I've lost my job, so I'm having trouble paying all my bills."
Tom speaks French as well as English.
He is just an amateur.
Could you let me see your notes?
Tom said that he doesn't plan on going by himself.
I had an operation for glaucoma last year.
He'll do his best to finish the job.
Can I ask you a personal question?
I'm afraid this key does not fit.
I know that.
I wanted to introduce you to Tom.
I want you to meet everyone.
Do you have any ideas on how we can make sure Tom sticks around until the job is finished?
Do you have change for a dollar?
I'm wondering when to buy a computer.
"Tom doesn't know Mary, but he'd like to meet her."
He has a dog and six cats.
Tom has a heart condition.
This church dates from the 12th century.
I'll say no more.
"Long time, no see."
You may or may not win.
Tom's parents own the grocery store.
What was the weather report?
Have you made a decision yet?
This is exactly what I wanted to see.
You can go if you want.
I got up about five.
She earns 30 dollars per day.
You certainly have a lot of questions.
They escaped being punished.
Tom bought some croutons.
I'm not going to live here.
I don't know what kind of car Tom has.
Do you know how busy I've been?
"You're interested in a career in foreign relations, aren't you?"

Is that Tom's car?
Now I'm sad.
Did Tom eat dinner?
Go to the hospital.
What did you wear?
Tom caught Mary's eye and then pointed at his watch.
I've always hated you.
Do you have a crowbar in your toolbox?
I didn't ask you for your opinion.
How did you two meet?
It doesn't look like Tom is very happy.
The pain melted away as the ointment was rubbed into his foot.
Don't you think it's still a little too early to talk to Tom about this?
Read the book aloud.
Tom kept working.
Tom didn't need to look at the menu because he'd been to that restaurant many times before.

Hotels are cheaper in the off season.
Can I keep one of your pictures?
He has very regular features.
Tom actually believed you.
Tom drinks a lot of beer.
We want to talk to you about that.
I have three alarm clocks so as not to oversleep.
"If I were you, I would buy it."

Don't you believe me?
Do you know kabuki?

We have no classes on Wednesday afternoons.
Tom couldn't have done it without you.
You're not making sense.
Do I detect sarcasm?
I went by there last night.
"Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
Check your tire pressure.
I'll help you realize your potential.
Tom is undressing.
I can't remember exactly who told me that.
I'm fed up with this wet weather.
What advice can you give me?
Can I sit with you?
Tom would accept.
Let's go and see Tom.
I know where Tom lived.
