"Like it or not, you have to do that right away."
Your daughter is very pretty.

I don't like to argue about politics.
Tom left without shutting the door.
More than 45 million Americans live in poverty.

You can't make me leave.
Tom is adopted.
Tom is taking the week off.
It's just a flesh wound.
How long do you plan to stay here?
"You'll pay for this, Tom."
It takes time to get over a divorce.
It wasn't funny.
The guy driving the truck that crashed into our car didn't have a driver's license.

Are you really the one who donated all that money?
I'd like to travel around the world.

I'll come by and pick you up tomorrow morning.
I thought you loved reading.
What do you like to eat for lunch?
I found the photo you were looking for.
Tom raised his hands.
That isn't actually what I meant.
Tom didn't want to wait so long.
I cannot quite understand it.
Tom should have married Mary.
I wonder which way is the shortest.

That's not good for your health.
You've got the wrong idea.
We close at 7 p.m.
Tom didn't tell me to do that.
You'll get a lot of presents on your birthday.
Anyone can see that.
I'll call you right after the meeting.

Mary was convinced that she would never get married.
I've already told you that.
I wish I'd had more time to prepare.

It was quite pleasant.
He had one of his socks on inside out.
Is it harder to forgive or to forget?
Didn't you go out?
You're starting to sound like your mother.
Tom and Mary can't afford to buy a house.
The baby needs its mother.
I think they saw me.
Can I help?

Did that really just happen?
Even Tom smiled.
You can't just not do your job.
I think Tom is a nice name.
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
I saw a young man lying on the bench under the cherry tree in the park.

We also went to the temple.
I leave it to your imagination.
It was all planned.
Can you hear it?
I was caught in a shower on my way home from school.
I never actually wanted to do that.
Do you find that amusing?
I'll be free.
Tom gets up at 6:30.
I need to get to this meeting now.
I hope that you will like it.
No one saw Tom take it.
Tom's father doesn't approve of him having long hair and a beard.
"Don't ask questions, just do it."
He's just a liar.
I can't understand why he left so suddenly.

How much do I owe you for the ticket?
Things are getting too dangerous around here.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
We knew that.
"I can't do this without you, Tom."
Just do your job.
Tom rushed in.
Chivalry isn't dead.
He sat smoking on the bench.

I'm glad to see you're doing OK.
It's been a long time since I've heard anyone use that word.
Everybody applauded.

I'll see you to your car.
The company has a capital of a million dollars.
I was so excited that I could not fall asleep.
When did you hear the sound?
Please lock the door when you leave.
It's cloudy today.
It was not unexpected.
Tom quit going out with Mary because he didn't like her sense of humor.
Do you think there's any chance that Tom knows Mary's phone number?
A thief believes everybody steals.
I can't believe we finally made it.
Tom's jokes are hilarious and get even better after he's had a few beers.
How did you get your nickname?
Tom moved his cursor.
This is a restricted area.
Don't run so fast.
You said that last time.
I didn't sleep on the plane.

"According to many religions, adultery is a crime."
He drives a pickup truck.
I can't see anything from here.
Our paths have crossed very often.
Could you take our picture?

There are four seasons in a year.
That girl is very attractive.
How long does it take to get there from here?
We talked for some time.
Tom has been in prison for half his life.
She can't live without him.
Nothing has been overlooked.
I didn't know Tom last year.
What is it for?
I play the piano after supper.
Tom owns a yellow sports car.
It was hot in the room.

See you next week.
You're sharp.

He had the bad habit of drinking too much wine.
You shouldn't have done it.
You must do as you are told.
I'm writing a book.
Maybe I don't need Tom.

Don't you think I know my own brother?
That's what we want.
She prefers quiet music.
"While we were speaking, he kept silent."
I didn't recognize the tune.
I think I'm falling in love with Tom.
It is essentially a question of time.
How does that sound?
Is there something in particular that you want to watch?
I'm going to make this material into a skirt.
Mary asked her husband to grow a mustache like Tom's.
This movie theater has two floors.
Aren't you going to vote today?
Your guess is entirely off the mark.
"Well, I have to be going."
Our hens laid a lot of eggs yesterday.
Tom and Mary look healthy.
I should very much appreciate a prompt reply.
She speaks good English.
There was a detour on the road.
Tom will be arriving here soon from Australia.
I don't remember inviting you here.
You look like a little girl in that dress.
Tom and Mary wanted to be left alone.
Clear off the table.
They smiled at each other.
She said she was happy.
Both of the girls are wearing white suits.
You're doing it wrong!
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
Let's proceed.
Wait until I'm done eating.
Please come inside.
Do you drink?
Why are you so mad?
That's what I told him.
Just give me what you owe me and I'll leave.
That is your major problem.
I was always a loner.
Tom is truly gifted.
Think before you leap.
He had to face the music.
Mary is my wife.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
We regard the situation as serious.
I bought a new bicycle.
Is Tom left-handed or right-handed?
I was born in Osaka.
Tom knows just how you feel.
Tom walked into the pub and ordered a pint of beer.
He is my classmate.
He is heroic.
"He was very tall and thin, with long arms and legs."
I acknowledge my mistake.
I bet you can't catch me.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
You must quit drinking.
Where do you think you're going dressed like that?
Keep that to yourself.
You should do that right now.
Swimming here is very dangerous.
The dog and the cat are sleeping together in a basket.
We happened to ride the same train.
Let's do the homework together.
I try to only eat healthy foods.
"The house is small, but it's enough for us."
"This hall can hold 5,000 people."
Tom trained his dog to jump through hoops.
I like white wine better than red wine.
Tom is never late for school.
Our whole case hinges on whether the government's actions were constitutional or not.
"Seen from a distance, that rock looks like a human face."
You can always count on him in any emergency.
Have you ever done it?
Can you distinguish her from her sister?
Write your name in capitals.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
Tom is hard to get along with.
He is stronger than I am.
When will he go home?
Did you see Mary's reaction when she saw the spider?
Have you ever touched a dolphin?
Tom is going to show us the documents this afternoon.
I didn't expect that result.
Has Tom promised to help us?
Is it my turn?
I ate fish yesterday.
He cannot have done such a thing.
Tom collected his things and left the room.
Tom is coming home.
I think that would be cool.
I really want to thank you.
"As far as I know, no one has ever done it."
Tom chose a song from the list and began singing it.
His story sounds true.
Tom doesn't want to play any of the songs Mary requested.
You should not climb the mountain in such bad weather.
Some parents don't punish their children when they lie.
He cares a lot about his reputation.
Please forgive me for telling a lie.
Tom has a tattoo on his left arm.
That's discouraging.
He decided he would put off his departure.
The dog is as good as dead.
Tom got a job as a waiter.
Stop telling me what to do. You're not my mom.
I don't have time to play games.
She was holding an umbrella.
I assume you only hire people who speak more than one language.
I won't die.
I hope you will be able to come to this party.
"If you eat so much, you'll get sick."
Getting involved with Tom was a mistake.
Tom isn't a child anymore.
Tom didn't answer your question.
I think nobody has ever done such a thing before.
We marveled at the little boy's eloquence.
This isn't working.
I had to stay home.
I decided to come to Japan last year.
I couldn't believe what was happening.
France is in western Europe.
I miss you a lot.
Tom has been going to that beach every summer since he was very young.
Tom has high blood pressure.
Couldn't you go someplace else?
Leave me alone.
Tom appears worried.
Mary is not a huge football fan.
Tom found me a job.
Do you feel like going out for a drive in the country over the weekend?
Who will try this case?
The bridge was washed away by the flood.
The receptionist at the hotel was surly and not at all friendly.
Is there space for another person?
You don't need to answer that question.
He amused us with a funny story.
He refused to take the bribe.
When was the last time you threw a party?
The pizza tasted good.
Tom had solar panels installed on the roof of his house.
You can't drink the water here.
Tom makes more money than Mary does.
"My uncle, who lives in Osaka, visited us yesterday."
I'm surprised Tom didn't notice Mary leave.
Keep the windows open.
I took an arrow in the knee.
I spent my vacation in Australia.
Is this where you live?
Marilyn Monroe died 33 years ago.
That is how the accident occurred.
We'll never have to do this again.
It was very confusing.
I can't sell you that.
Do you want to talk to me or not?
Tom said that he did his homework by himself.
Ancient people liked to tell stories of bravery.
His carelessness cost him a broken leg.
I like to ride on trains.
I've simplified it a little bit.
Give him a hug.
I borrowed this book from him.
Did you see her face?
It's almost over.
He was in his shirt sleeves.
They decided to pull down the old building.
Don't ask me to do that.
Nobody wants you to do this.
"It'll cost about 2,000 yen to repair it."
My grandfather was a hero.
It's an excellent method to relieve stress.
That's a sign.
Try your best in everything.
The sun is coming up.
Her death was a great shock to me.
You should wait inside.
"Tom wasn't OK, but Mary was."
Shall I carry your bag?
"I will see you on next Tuesday, that is to say, the 10th of September."
Dad is a hard worker.
I would like him to write more often.
The ASEAN nations have come a long way.
What did Tom and Mary quarrel about?
Tom asked Mary if she was free on Valentine's Day.
I paid for Tom's ticket.
You don't seem too happy to see me.
Tom is back in town.
"Just out of curiosity, what do you expect to happen?"
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
He added a little sugar and milk to his tea.
Tom went to Boston at the end of October.
We won this time.
May I request a favour of you?
I can't untie this knot.
I'm still busy.
Come watch us play music sometime.
You ask questions about everything.
No one believes me.
I hope we'll find lots of it.
Wait for us.
The ice cream was delicious.
I keep a diary in English.
I almost always walk to work.
How adventurous!
I'm trying to work out this problem.
Who is your lawyer?
Your bicycle is similar to mine.
The shoemaker said the shoes were too old to repair.
You won't have that problem.
What does one call you?
"You thanked Tom for the present, didn't you?"
"You don't like Tom very much, do you?"
This is a top secret mission.
A curtain of mist blocked our view.
The Socialist Party groomed him as a presidential candidate.
"Speech is silver, silence is gold."
Tom didn't want to tell Mary about what had happened.
My father gives my mother all of his salary.
Why is Tom's name not on the list?
The bread is stale.
She is growing tall.
You ought not to stay up so late.
Dry sand absorbs water.
I chose the wrong answer.
How do you do this?
Boston is overrated.
It doesn't mean anything!
Ask Tom how Mary is.
Tom wants to go back to Boston.
Come on. I'm taking you home.
I have to try.
Tom won't be here that long.
"Luckily, you were at home."
An important quality of steel is its strength.
Let me take a quick shower.
Everyone was dressed in black.
I'll go by taxi.
I had a hard time finding his house.
Can I go buy some ice cream?
Tom ate a quick lunch.
He talked to himself.
I was taken up to the third floor.
Tom wanted to give Mary a chance to explain why she hadn't yet done the work.
May I help you?
Such a thing occurs frequently.
Sexual harassment has now become a social issue.
She has been watching television for three hours.
"If you trust such a fellow, you'll lose everything you have."
He kept me waiting for a long time.
China is much bigger than Japan.
Tom hasn't painted his house yet.
That is a pencil.
"You don't really want to talk about this, do you?"
I can't wait to eat the cake.
The interior of the cabin was cozy and warm.
The conductor appeared on the stage.
Tom did a terrible thing.
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
You should try to find somebody closer to your own age to date.
I want my desk back.
I want a friend.
"If the weather is fine, I'll go swimming in the river."
Go inside.
I play football every day.
I will do it right now.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom.
The dog should be on a chain.
The police shut down Tom’s lemonade stand.
How long did you work for Tom?
They're both expecting babies.
"You don't know this song, so don't try to sing along."
I have what you're looking for.
Do you really think Tom will let you do that?
There have been a lot of complaints in the last few days about the amount of noise coming from your apartment.
This is the camera I bought yesterday.
It's all up to you.
Don't kid yourself.
Don't punish the children.
Have you seen this man?
My sister bought five yards of cloth.
My aunt lives in New York.
We were right.
It's all going to be OK.
Tom came here last week.
The bureau drawer has several compartments.
That book is a new book.
Please remain seated.
I spent a whole day in cleaning up my room.
Tom's parents got divorced when he was very young.
Let the boy go.
Is that a boy or a girl?
I kept my word.
He didn't open his mouth all afternoon.
You should eat more vegetables.
"Tom got down on his knees in front of everyone in the restaurant, pulled a diamond ring out of his pocket and proposed to Mary, to the applause of all present."
I wonder if Tom found something.
Tom asked me whether I was hungry.
I'm going to get you.
I had to pay in cash.
He walked across the street.
What happened can't be undone.
The king abused his power.
You can learn as much in the library as in school.
The boy complained of a headache.
Tom is folding his laundry.
Do you smell something?
You're totally right.
The food here is inexpensive and delicious.
I'm sure you'll like Tom.
Tom poured me a cup of tea.
Her son will succeed for sure.
We went to see turtles on the beach.
Perhaps she will come tomorrow.
"If I had known her address, I could have visited her."
You can't show this video to anyone.
The scenery was beautiful beyond description.
We don't have a lot of options here.
The boy is jumping.
I shouldn't have sold my car.
Let's do this another time.
Swimming in the sea is great fun.
Do you really believe those stories?
Tom usually walks his dog on a leash.
I made fun of Tom's accent.
He tried to sleep on the floor.
They should have arrived home by now.
I don't feel like working.
You're the experts.
He doesn't want you to know.
Tom is history.
Be careful crossing the street.
I cannot afford to keep a car.
I just want you to listen.
You should have attended the meeting.
I worry about my future.
I get off work around midnight.
Tom asked Mary if she loved him.
"Tom didn't know where Mary was going, but he had a good idea where she might be going."
Tom spent the last years of his life in Boston.
Don't you think that's a little strange?
Tom used to play football before he got married.
Why didn't you wake me up?
How did you get a naked picture of me?
I would like you to meet my parents.
You can't just not show up.
I doubt Tom knows how to fish.
What can you tell us?
It doesn't matter now.
Tom lives somewhere around here.
The man went to pieces when the judge said he would have to go to prison for life.
My customers never complain.
The plan was doomed to failure from the start.
Tom should've let me know earlier.
You two have a lot in common.
Towns are larger than villages.
He is proud of his punctuality.
He's a very talented man.
She accused me of telling a lie.
"If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave."
I'm sorry that I can't come today.
Are you guys still dating each other?
He decided to put off his departure.
I'm pretty sure Tom really loved Mary.
Tom is no longer living in Boston.
I'm not your husband anymore.
A father provides for his family.
Tell Tom it was a mistake.
I don't usually work on Mondays.
I always tie my shoes tightly before I go jogging.
Where shall we meet?
My father is expecting you to phone him tomorrow.
How will you stop him?
Not a sound was heard.
This isn't my money.
"If you want quality, pay for it."
Tom decided not to go to the party.
I wish you had more time for me.
Are you sick?
We should make it if the traffic isn't too heavy.
It's like a drug.
Paper burns easily.
Put your hands up in the air!
The teacher called the students in alphabetical order.
Did Tom need help?
I want to find out who did this.
There are only two ways out of this house.
Tom will save us.
Today is a good day to die.
"Tom entered the classroom, carrying his bicycle helmet."
I reconsidered your proposal.
Tom doesn't want to drink anything else.
Things have changed here.
I don't understand what you mean.
I'll go provided you go with me.
I don't like it when you're so busy.
I wish you'd never been born.
He looked for every possible means of escape.
It's monkey meat.
You knew how to count to ten when you were two years old.
She watched him dance.
What Tom did was incredibly stupid.
Tom rides a bike to work.
Tom had a hectic week.
Tom promised never to be late again.
Who's that woman standing over there?
We went without him because he wasn't ready.
Tom likes to play with puppets.
"If you stop and relax, this will relieve the tension and stress in your shoulders."
Almost all of Tom's free time is spent on a golf course.
He'll be here any second.
How much is a first class ticket?
I'm over here.
He lives far away from his hometown.
How about dining out for a change?
Tom's car wouldn't start and he had to get a new battery.
Tom has long legs.
I want to buy a pair of ski boots.
There are a lot of famous old buildings in Kyoto.
Tom isn't speaking to me anymore.
Tom's attention remained focused on Mary.
Tom married young.
I suggested that he follow my advice.
Follow your sister's example.
We need to talk to you.
Tom switched off his computer.
"He has two daughters, one is a pianist and the other is a violist."
Are all these books yours?
There's no doubt.
Tom was born in Boston in 2013.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
We mustn't let this news get out.
"Although I was exhausted, I continued to work."
She put her CDs in a row on the shelf.
He found his key and opened the door.
How do you know there isn't one?
Have you seen my pen?
Can I go first?
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
That's Tom's answer for everything.
Is it true that you're Tom's sister?
They're waiting for you.
I'm feeling OK except for the earache.
You've hurt Tom's feelings.
You are not allowed to leave the room.
How do you like your new job?
Why don't you go play outside?
Tom said you were busy.
She put the money in the bank.
Do you think I'm ugly?
Do you have any tax-free articles?
I love what I do.
I eat sushi every chance I get.
I haven't heard that joke in ages.
Tom was mauled by a vicious animal.
He fell asleep with the radio on.
"Are you Swedish? ""No, I'm Swiss."""
I can die happy now.
Can you leave it with me till this afternoon?
Tom was wearing a new hat.
Let's relax a little.
He likes geography and history.
Teenagers often wear strange clothes.
She is certainly above forty.
What would you like to eat?
Tom offered to drive Mary home after work.
You're in great danger.
Do you play golf?
She was carrying a large leather bag under her arm.
Tom knows who Mary is.
Tom and Mary are students.
Do you want to come along with us?
Give me a day.
How about a cup of cocoa?
Please call him up.
I want to study math.
Finishing this job by Tuesday will be easy.
He failed in his attempt to swim across the river.
I would rather stay at home than go out in this hot weather.
I don't know what Tom's problem is.
Your death will be painless.
I told you not to tell anyone.
I helped them yesterday.
We were friends.
Did you hit Tom?
We'll do it.
What is your favorite fast-food restaurant?
How are you holding up?
We're fighting for our lives.
The wounded are getting better.
Call me if there's a change.
You don't want that.
I had a guilty conscience.
I am ashamed of your conduct.
That firm has a good reputation.
Tom quickly reloaded his gun.
"If I were you, I wouldn't go there by myself."
Have you read that book?
The person who shot JFK worked for the CIA.
Tom didn't go home last night.
May I have this book?
Night came on.
I'll be with you as soon as I finish this job.
I asked Tom to stop.
Tom ripped open his presents.
Tom doesn't have enough money yet to buy the car he wants.
Add more water to it.
The man robbed her bag.
The book fell to the floor.
It's a risk that I'm willing to take.
I went swimming after I woke up.
Tom is going to want to do that.
This car is older than I am.
Who's your favorite painter?
I regret to inform you that your application has been refused.
The law was enforced immediately.
What do I know?
She has a claim on her deceased husband's estate.
I found the key underneath the mat.
What do you expect me to do?
There's no doubt that he's English.
Did you know this at the time?
Please don't follow this advice.
He must be innocent.
How often are letters delivered here?
Were you there when it happened?
This yogurt tastes strange.
She likes to play the koto very much.
I want to see Boston.
I could've met you at the airport.
That bicycle belongs to our school.
I've always been interested in botany.
Are you accusing us of price gouging?
The chimney is made of brick.
I'll try to keep it short.
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
We'll meet Tom there.
The problem was too much for me.
Tom is joking.
How was your day?
The roof of the house is red.
Tom might get sick.
Tom needs to let off some steam.
The unspoken question is why.
I want to go to another country.
This is a public beach.
Tom asked Mary what the weather had been like while he was away.
I'll be done in five minutes.
I see Tom here all the time.
What is your decision?
I just don't think it's possible.
Tom didn't like living in the country.
Which do you think she chose?
I was too astonished to speak.
I require that all my employees be on time.
You shouldn't make fun of Tom.
"Could you do that, Tom?"
"As soon as he saw a policeman, he ran away."
Please don't get up.
Hide the money.
"Although she was tired, she tried to finish the work."
She is a well-known singer.
"Japan is, as it were, his second home."
He resembles his grandfather.
Tom's great-great-great grandmother lived in Scotland.
We trust him.
Where did you find that strange thing?
Mary wants to have a balanced lifestyle.
You are our one millionth customer.
I know the boy standing over there.
I have to buy a car this weekend.
Please tell Tom.
"If you want to talk, let's talk."
Politicians in Japan sometimes get away with doing illegal things.
Could you drive Tom home?
The story reminded me of my father.
I'm busy today.
It's been 10 days since my boyfriend went to jail.
Tom waited for Mary to come home.
He passed by without looking at me.
America loves you.
Tom said you speak French.
He's very talented.
A lot of companies have pared their staff down to a minimum.
Why didn't Tom come?
My knee hurts.
Looters stole ancient artifacts from the tomb.
Tom speaks French so badly that he's often misunderstood.
She turned off the radio.
Do you want me to read this out loud to you?
I'll help you.
How much for half a kilo?
Tom knew that would happen.
There will be a reward for the person who finds my dog.
He asked me to dance.
I swim here every morning.
He is known to the public.
I didn't know it at the time.
I just want to live a normal life.
"Corn yields in the U.S. have increased fivefold over the past seventy years, thanks to advances in agricultural technology."
I hope you feel at home.
I don't want to go anywhere tonight.
What you said convinced Tom.
I work a lot.
I found it.
I thought I was going to suffocate on the crowded train.
I'll tell Tom you asked.
I think this is going to work.
I'm glad someone agrees with me for once.
Why can't I stay with you?
"I love you, too."
His father was a policeman.
Tom hid some papers behind his back.
It is strange that he has not come yet.
How did you know Tom was going to Boston?
I just want to go home.
I didn't want to scare you.
She jumped for joy the moment she heard the news.
Tom doesn't have a good French-English dictionary.
"I tried to persuade Tom to come to Boston with us, but he said he had other things he had to do."
Tom closed his laptop and stood up.
I'll finish it in two or three minutes.
I like your beard.
They named the dog Shiro.
I'd like to help you.
Tom raises rabbits for meat.
You can see a lot of stars in the sky.
May I speak to you outside for a minute?
I am afraid of dogs.
I always carry a small pocketknife.
Do you have tuna fish?
Look at these photos.
He did not enjoy his lessons.
Rainforests should be preserved.
Tom stood on his head.
"Tom said that he loved me, too."
"If he should arrive late, you may start the conference without him."
Here is your bag.
I haven't done any of the things you've asked me to do.
"She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so."
She can do both at the same time.
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
I underestimated Tom.
Did you remember to buy candles?
I should stop procrastinating.
I can't explain everything now.
Don't act like you're so innocent.
Tom died two years ago in a plane crash.
Do you know my father?
When does the game start?
Tom calls Mary every night.
He's not cut out for teaching.
I've made some mistakes that I should've been able to avoid.
Tom sometimes wears a hat.
Do you think you've made the wrong choice?
Look ahead.
Please tell Tom it's important.
We never said that we were Canadians.
Things have changed.
Tom wasn't able to defend himself.
Mary is a widow.
Who am I?
Tom likes you.
Why don't you wait in the car while I go into the store?
Why do people kill themselves?
I don't like this type of house.
Do you talk to your dog?
Tom closed the door when he left the room.
I am wasting my time.
What time will we arrive in Boston?
My father will be forty soon.
I like it.
I've got a great idea.
Tom got sleepy.
Tom didn't want to waste any more time calculating how much time had been wasted.
I think Tom's here.
I especially like your chocolate cake.
She's feeling much better thanks to that medical treatment.
We were reading a book and it was a very good one.
Tom ran down the road as naked as a jaybird.
How long did it take you to translate this book?
Tom will never have to worry about money.
I'm not ashamed of that.
Tom became a policeman.
I seem to have caught a bad cold.
I had something else in mind.
Who doesn't think so?
Life is a dream.
Do you think Dad will change his mind?
"Tom, can you get us some water?"
He established the company.
I don't think Tom is in Boston.
Tom left a gift for you.
I am going to go to Tokyo tomorrow.
I'm leaving you tomorrow.
She identified him as the murderer.
You can hear everything.
We're going to listen to their new record together.
Tom likes Mary and Mary likes Tom.
Please tell me you're joking.
I haven't seen anything of her lately.
The little girl stuck out her tongue at him.
"Are you going, too?"
Tom is still waiting for you.
Your story wasn't interesting.
He has knowledge and experience as well.
I'm going to be late for class.
I had a good time.
Did you remember to do what I asked you to do?
This doesn't look like Tom's handwriting.
Let's go out and eat dinner together from time to time.
He doesn't know me.
Tom had trouble believing that Mary would actually want to go out with him.
We haven't discussed it yet.
How sure are you it's not Tom?
You can take a taxi.
I saw her coming up the road.
Tom wants to learn how to ski.
"Even though Tom is only sixteen, he looks like he's over twenty."
"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die."
Do you know Tom's phone number?
"Two beers, please."
Tom couldn't tell from Mary's reaction how she felt about what he had said to her.
They didn't offer me anything to drink.
Tom hid himself under the bed.
"Recently, Tom has been worrying about his future."
She bit into the apple.
It's your favorite song.
There is a serious problem.
You may take either of the books.
How do you know it won't happen again?
There are a lot of beautiful places in Japan.
I asked where he had been.
Tom wasn't willing to cooperate.
"That's an order, Tom."
He had the cheek to ask me to help him.
"If we miss the train, we'll go by bus."
I wish I could figure out how to finish this project without asking for help.
Who's going to look after my sick grandfather if something happens to me?
He's a lawyer.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
Tom pushed the clutch pedal down with his left foot.
It was him that broke the window yesterday.
We did not evolve from monkeys. We share a common ancestor.
She greeted me with a big smile.
No one has seen Tom for years.
Come on home.
Tom uncorked the bottle with his teeth.
I'm not doing great.
How long were you planning on keeping this a secret from me?
Tom loves money.
We were all tired.
Tom's car won't start.
Are you all alone?
Tom almost never goes to Boston.
Tom slipped away unnoticed.
The children want to go to the pool.
I hate it when hair clogs the drain.
Tom's grinning.
The valley was twenty miles wide.
Tom wants to drink a cup of coffee.
The birds flew to the south.
Do you know who you’re talking to?
We can't let Tom in.
Tom drove back to Boston.
Tom came.
Tom forgot his wedding anniversary.
Put it on.
How much snow have you had?
I thought you'd be too busy to see me.
The hardware store is still where it used to be.
I don't have a phone.
He is even afraid of his own shadow.
When's the wedding?
Tom isn't here at the moment.
We have lobsters only on special occasions.
I keep it in the attic.
I asked Tom if he knew Mary.
Where did you get that piece of wire?
How long have you known?
"Where do you live, Tom?"
Yours is over there.
I'll come back on the tenth.
He failed to come up to our expectations.
You missed your chance.
Tom is not welcome in this house.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
It appears to be broken.
Tom says he can't even work in this heat.
Tom is the one who bandaged Mary's arm.
This vending machine is out of order.
Where's my driver?
How did you do it without our help?
"This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday."
He carried his grandfather on his back.
Tom runs a company in Boston.
I believe in my abilities.
That doesn't mean that I'll stop doing it.
I've never done harm to anyone.
How long have you worked for us?
My father has just returned from abroad.
Do you like that song?
It's too hot inside.
May I use your car today?
I'm bad at keeping secrets.
My shoelace got caught in the escalator.
Just relax. Everything's going to be all right.
What do I owe you?
Tom told the truth.
I couldn't speak French.
I'd be lying if I said no.
Tom has begun to look into the matter.
This isn't complicated.
My girlfriend often cuts my hair.
My clothes are still wet.
I am who I am thanks to my mother.
Tom didn't recognize anyone in the room.
I believe that it's all a hoax.
There are some eggs in the box.
Take the first street to the right.
Tom doesn't have any friends who like to go camping.
You can't park there.
Tom has many friends here.
She looks exactly the same as she was at school.
She's been poisoned.
I'm not going to tell you the reason.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
"If that is true, then he is not responsible for the accident."
I can open the window.
I could have done it without your help.
I don't like running.
He must be crazy to behave like that.
We can't let Tom find Mary.
Is it OK if I go over to Tom's house to play?
"I can read German, but I can't speak it."
You've been luckier than me.
We have been studying French for three years.
"Robinson is a practical, rational and brave man."
You can't blame him for the accident.
You can't fix it. You should buy a new one.
Tom and Mary walked down the busy sidewalk.
I consider Tom one of my closest friends.
Children shouldn't be spoiled.
Tom is Mary's boyfriend's father's cousin.
"You're imagining things, Tom."
He doesn't like fish.
I thought Tom was Mary's boyfriend.
What have you learned about Tom so far?
Do you have paper?
The ice was thick enough for me to walk on.
Tom got home just before 2:30.
Tom and I planted some trees on the south side of the house.
She can never keep a secret.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be married.
I know Tom isn't your boyfriend.
I always take a bath before going to bed.
Tom wanted to stay.
You've been luckier than me.
That's when I'll do it.
Would you like me to help you with your luggage?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
What's the safest way to get to the top of the mountain?
All is well that ends well.
She has a wonderful personality.
I just didn't want to take any chances.
Tom spent the afternoon with friends on the beach.
Tom's in there.
I got even with him.
You should rest.
"Even when I was a child, I was able to swim well."
This is a stupid idea.
"You can swim, can't you?"
Have you been to London before?
"Weather permitting, we are going to get to the top of the mountain tomorrow."
The danger is apparently over.
New York is worth visiting.
Tom doesn't like it here.
This happened prior to receiving your letter.
Tom took a drink and then offered the bottle to Mary.
I knew we'd win.
I am very concerned about his health.
You know I'm married.
I can't remember the last time I spoke to Tom.
"I was planning to do my homework, but I fell asleep."
I wonder what Tom means by that.
Suit yourself.
I want to know where you heard that.
"It was a nice party. You should have come, too."
The patient's condition changes from day to day.
This house is not very large.
He tried harder to get good marks than I did.
He lied to his parents.
That's a very good car.
Tom and Mary invited John and Alice to their wedding.
"Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?"
He is twice as old as I am.
Are you waiting for anybody?
You shouldn't laugh at Tom when he makes mistakes.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
We had a very hot summer this year.
Tom is able to play soccer.
Tom didn't help much.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
He died from overwork.
Where do you buy vegetables?
The captain gave the order to abandon the ship.
Tom will share.
That is not what the narrative is about.
You're very mature for your age.
It is likely to be cold this winter.
Tom isn't mad at you.
Bread is baked in an oven.
Come with me.
I'm taking off now.
What's wrong with my manners?
Can you please translate this for me?
I'm not finicky.
Tom loaded the bags into the trunk of his car.
"You must apologize to her, and do it at once."
Nobody knows where he has gone.
I overslept yesterday.
My father takes a walk every day.
She died yesterday.
I can't help.
Let's start!
I trust Tom.
Tom took a couple of steps back.
I listen to the radio every night.
How do I explain it so that everyone understands it?
You've got a good head on your shoulders.
He has trouble remembering names.
We are flying over the Pacific.
My homeroom teacher is the same age as my mother.
Tom needs a driver's license.
They're not good.
I'm not like that.
Tom and Mary met in Boston three years ago.
Tom asked me to look after his children.
I fear nothing.
He won't talk to her and she won't talk to him.
I don't believe in religion.
Tom isn't coming till tomorrow.
Tom enjoyed being a celebrity.
Tom helped Mary get back on her feet.
I go swimming once a week.
I thought you might be able to tell me how to do this.
I believe Tom is correct.
Tom pleaded guilty to drunken driving and his driver's license was suspended for six months.
Tom has won three races in a row.
She attracted our attention.
I hear that he eats frogs.
We'll win.
Tom isn't a liar.
This window won't open.
I think Tom must be hungry.
They won.
"We wish you well, Tom."
I recommend Tom.
I don't want to say that to Tom.
Go to bed.
I've just finished lunch.
"You, too, should have seen that movie."
There is always the risk of losing all the data on your hard disk.
You were wearing a blue coat the day I first met you.
Tom isn't listed in the phone book.
I'm pretty sure Tom is dating Mary.
You must keep your room tidy.
"Even though the media reports that she is a potential presidential candidate, does anyone really think that she is a potential president?"
He's very protective of her.
I must hurry.
I met him just now.
Do you want to take that?
Thanks for the hint.
Do you remember what she said?
Where's our car?
Tom is liked by everyone.
He lives in a very small room.
Tom and Mary were sitting next to each other on the couch.
Please buy a few apples.
Can you teach me English?
You promised me you'd look after Tom.
The Beatles are popular among young people.
Thanks for having me here.
I'm not ashamed.
Tom is not a happy boy.
I believe I made myself clear.
I can tell you that it didn't happen.
How long did it take you to get to Boston?
That's terrible.
I'm a little busy.
They ate lunch together.
Tom wrote to Mary this week.
Get out of my way.
Tom removed his sunglasses.
Two jet planes took off at the same time.
I'd like to hear what your opinion is.
"I'll take that one, too."
My foot hurts.
I can't remember how to go there.
You are morons.
The soldier saved his friend at the cost of his own life.
Do you think this is funny?
Better to be the head of a dog than the tail of a lion.
Tom was my babysitter.
You didn't have to come into the office today.
It's Tom's phone.
I was in such a hurry that I left my bag behind.
Tom can't hide the truth from Mary anymore.
The hunter followed the bear's tracks.
Tom knows that everything Mary is saying is true.
You're not looking so hot.
Please promise you'll never do that again.
Tom doesn't know who painted that picture.
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve.
He would like to come with us to the movie.
She is about to leave.
I considered Tom.
Would you mind waiting a moment?
I'll talk to you later.
I won't go there anymore.
I hate riddles.
She advised him not to buy a used car.
I don't usually burn incense at home.
"You don't know who did it, do you?"
You know that your English is good when people stop complimenting you on how good your English is.
What kind of girl are you?
Tom asked Mary if she was free the next day.
"Without your assistance, I would have failed."
My headache is completely gone.
Tom is grateful.
Welcome to the USA.
Her crying was just an act.
Tom was the one who wrote this story.
He thought up an excuse.
I'm sure that she has arrived at the village by now.
I'd like a chance to set the record straight.
Try on this sweater.
I bought that scarf we looked at yesterday.
Tom is a newcomer.
I'll get another job.
You don't need to do it right away.
I caused this.
Why did no one warn me?
We can at least try.
Tom came with Mary.
Did you propose to Mary?
Let me have a word with Tom.
The teacher asked us to clean our classroom every day.
This house is quite small.
Thank you for your attention.
The police never showed up.
What do I look like?
Tom didn't go to college.
Who believes in God?
I sat down in the shade of a tree and read the book.
Don't you have anything to say?
I don't come here very often.
There were four chairs by the table.
Tom is still there.
That's a good idea.
We assumed you were dead.
I want to study French.
She is a member of this organization.
I'm very worried about you.
I don't believe half of what I've been told about you.
She is concerned about her son's health.
They helped him get to Canada.
I started reading the book.
"If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask."
Does Tom enjoy it?
The concert will take place next summer.
She is very fond of writing poems.
It is because he is cruel that I dislike him.
We knew them very well.
Why aren't we doing that?
Be on your guard against him.
I've just changed my mind.
His debts amounted to a thousand dollars.
There are more women than men in the world.
I don't know where Tom and Mary met.
I feel on top of the world.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
Tom sounded slightly panicked.
"Having failed twice yesterday, he doesn't want to try again."
I don't want to drink that.
Tom is ticklish.
How could you do this to Tom?
He passed away quite suddenly.
Tom knows that we know.
Did Tom enjoy it?
I'm not going to ask Tom to do that.
Lawyers are all liars.
We must deal with this problem.
What did Tom just say to you?
These are animals.
Let me explain why.
I have to be up by 6:30.
Tom was the only one in the house.
I want to be alone for a while.
"Tom still owes Mary 2,000 dollars."
I can't stand that noise any longer.
Is there a barber shop in the hotel?
I love to read.
Did you murder Tom?
It's like one of those.
He walked down the street whistling cheerfully.
The new school failed to take into account the special needs of young people.
"You feel lonesome, don't you?"
Tom asked the DJ for a slow song.
Fix this.
Did you clean your room?
"As soon as I finish writing the report, I'll send it to you."
What is your name?
I never said anything like that.
The plan has worked well.
This is for internal use.
Tom said that he was very interested in archery.
She is used to speaking in public.
We became Americanized after World War II.
Tom has so much money that he doesn't know what to do with it.
The bartender kicked Tom out of the bar.
He is proud of his family.
Are we alone?
I wonder why the police didn't find the gun.
Give me a little more water.
I don't remember sending that text message.
My father doesn't drink liquor.
Her hair comes to her shoulders.
I intend to try.
Tom gave the baby a bath.
He picked up the book.
Tom is headstrong.
He went on singing.
Tom made a promise to himself that he would never make the same mistake again.
Where did you find the keys?
This is all Tom has to do.
The books are on the table.
Do you want to see Tom again?
I yelled for help.
That's a big problem.
This vase is very fragile.
There's a sale today in that department store.
Are you talking to yourself again?
Don't hurt me.
No one seems to have any idea where Tom is.
Tom kept a list of all the food he'd eaten that week.
Tom hasn't yet told us what he wants to do.
Mary is a waitress.
You're my brother and I love you.
The toilet doesn't flush.
He could die.
Why are these people in here?
How is your family doing?
Tom soon realized that no one was paying any attention to him.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
"If Tom does that, I will, too."
The detectives pursued him.
Tom begged Mary not to say anything.
"You might at least say ""thank you."""
I don't want to eat this.
I told Tom I'd pick him up after school.
Where are you now?
She's highly intelligent.
It appears that the bank robbery was planned right down to the last detail.
I can't read Tom's handwriting.
I was at work.
Tom and Mary talked all afternoon.
You're here awfully early today.
He lives above me.
Only you can answer the question.
"I recognized him at once, because I had seen him before."
I didn't know I was adopted.
His policies were too progressive.
We took a long hike up to the summit.
There are not enough chairs in the meeting room.
Do you think I'm fat?
There is no excuse for such behavior.
He lives in Tokyo.
When did you begin learning German?
I believe I have now told you everything.
Your father will be so proud of you.
Where's your phone?
There were fifteen persons injured in the accident.
Your fingerprints were on the gun.
What will you do now?
He assumed full responsibility.
I feel like vomiting.
Tom was killed by a snakebite.
He made a bad decision.
He can be trusted.
Is there anything to drink in the fridge?
What do I get out of it?
You may invite whoever you like.
The Rosetta Stone was found in 1799.
Tom is a realtor.
"I had heard that he was fat, but I didn't think he would be that fat."
I've never had that problem before.
Pork has a lot of fat.
Tom doesn't smoke or drink.
Tom wasn't married.
I have seen a shooting star once.
We're pretty pleased with that.
I'll take care of your kitten while you're away.
I'm busy preparing for the trip.
Tom was totally wasted.
Do you need help?
"Tom is going to be OK, isn't he?"
I wish I earned more money.
He treated it with utmost care.
Do you mind if I ask you something?
Do you know much about music?
The little girl screamed at the top of her lungs.
He wants to pay off his debts.
You're the only friend I have.
"You have no idea what that means, do you?"
Tom said that he loves me and wants to marry me.
I could hear everything.
"You don't recognize me, do you?"
"Although I was sick, I did my best."
We're lawyers.
I can't believe they hired me.
I have a lot of friends.
Tom drank milk.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Tom could tell right away that Mary was in trouble.
"Well, then, if you want me to I'll do it."
That's not what Tom wants you to do.
The secretary inserted the letter in the envelope.
I can't believe that Tom just left without saying anything.
It'll take you too long.
Tom almost convinced me.
I didn't mean to hit you.
You keep forgetting to pay the bills.
There is a book about dancing on the desk.
You should go to bed. It's almost midnight.
I prefer working alone.
She pretended that she knew nothing about it.
I told Tom I was fine.
Prices may change.
I'm not interested in talking to her.
Tom couldn't believe that Mary had actually kissed him.
I haven't had a chance to see the movie yet.
It is no use trying again.
Tom won't be here till 2:30.
I'll be ready in a jiffy.
How much money does Tom owe you?
We are thinking of buying some new furniture.
The boy narrowly escaped drowning.
What are you going to drink?
I think he will never come back.
Tom made some extra money by renting one of his rooms to a college student.
Is it too small?
I do that for Tom.
I don't have time to write.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
He tried it with a friend.
I have to take off my socks.
What was I saying?
I'd rather not discuss it now.
You look good.
What's your favorite question to ask on a first date?
The police are after the murderer.
Tom doesn't know if Mary will go camping with us or not.
Are we good to go?
You have better taste than I thought.
Tom fooled Mary.
If you keep at it you will eventually succeed.
Tom is behaving strangely.
Tom can't figure out how to get the box open.
I know how angry you are.
I can't just ignore Tom.
Tom arrived at the party after Mary did.
I can take the bus.
I see a girl standing under that tree.
I wish I had a better memory.
The motor does not function properly.
"You knew this was going to happen, right?"
Tom seems a little nervous.
It's in the fridge.
Can you wait here until I get back?
Most people only want to hear their own truth.
These factories are polluting the environment.
What would you change?
It's me!
Tighten the strap around the suitcase.
His poetry does not translate into Japanese.
English is a compulsory subject.
My father is the tallest of us all.
I can't get Tom to slow down.
Why aren't you at Tom's?
Tom needs to follow my advice.
It is not easy to get rid of bad habits.
Some snakes are poisonous.
Aren't you going to ask Tom?
Tom hasn't called.
Would you like to try it again?
He is skating.
He showed me his collection of stamps.
Will you tell me how to get to your house?
Do you enjoy playing mahjong?
Tom didn't believe Mary.
This book is selling like hotcakes.
I had dinner with Tom.
I study abroad.
Tom read the letter.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
Why did you sell it?
Tom and Mary are both good teachers.
You wouldn't have won without me.
Could you gift wrap it?
There are no gods.
Tom put on some music.
What are you two fighting about?
He's a successful banker.
I've got a lot of thinking to do.
Nobody likes impolite salesmen.
The fact is we were not invited.
What would you do in this situation?
Mary showed the letter to me.
He has more than five dictionaries.
"I've apologized, so get off my back."
I know how to fly.
Tom looks angry.
There is a strong bond between the brothers.
We're moving in next door.
I don't know what it is.
I understand it.
The train will be leaving in five minutes so you had better hurry up.
His answer was far from satisfactory.
Tom had his T-shirt on backwards.
I love this park.
I don't have the foggiest idea.
I'm so glad you called.
"She seldom, if ever, goes to movies by herself."
Has Flight 123 been delayed?
Can't you understand what's happening here?
I bought him a magazine.
I have to solve the problem myself.
Tom and Mary were both born in Boston.
Your hat is somewhere around here.
I prefer coffee.
I would like something to read.
Tom doesn't do anything without first asking Mary if it's OK.
Do you often talk to yourself?
I have to get that.
Tom sounds sad.
Tom could hardly breathe after the race.
We have to find out.
He would often say such a thing.
Let's talk about why you're here.
People here are very prejudiced.
Promise me one thing.
My foot fell asleep.
His mother died when he was eleven years old.
Tom was satisfied with the result.
I'll gladly help you.
Is Mary a real blonde?
I'll catch the next bus.
Don't forget to take your pills.
Leave now.
Tom is a very wealthy man.
What made you think Tom did that?
Let's divide this money between you and me.
Which newspaper do you usually read?
What are you going to take this semester?
We don't have all day.
I didn't see anybody.
"When I was your age, I had a job."
Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom is in prison.
Where's my brandy?
Why didn't you tell me three hours ago?
He has come!
That is not a tiger.
I don't hate Tom anymore.
"In case anything happens, call me immediately."
Sugar is soluble in water.
Do you think I'm wasting my time?
Are you going to do something about it?
Mary had the last laugh.
Tom thought he heard a dog barking.
Are you angry at him?
Tom got up at 6:30 as usual.
I love collecting stones at the beach.
Tom played a sad song on the piano.
Try as hard as you can.
Tom is worried.
"Man, don't say that!"
What's with you?
What's your cat's name?
I can't help you because I am busy.
It has to stop.
Do you think that he is equal to the task?
Does Tom have a problem with that?
I can't find anybody to ask.
Is it true that illegal immigrants are taking jobs away from citizens who want them?
This clock gains one minute a day.
That species of bird is said to be in danger of dying out.
Please ask at the information desk.
I hoped you would understand what I meant.
Tom was suspected of murder.
I think Tom was lying to me.
He asked me whether I was busy.
Nobody noticed Tom.
He came at dawn.
I didn't have to pay.
You are someone very special to me.
I like football.
It may not come to that.
You didn't hear this from me.
Stop doing that.
The thing that impressed me the most in China was the Chinese.
This show's main character is a talking squirrel.
Tom didn't tell us why we should come.
What's all this noise about?
Thank you for today.
Tom has plenty of time.
I saw a dirty dog coming into the garden.
She couldn't attend that party because she was sick.
There's something Tom is not telling us.
Has Tom been charged?
Tom won't be going camping with us this weekend.
That movie is worth seeing.
It looks as if you're right.
There are many active volcanoes in Japan.
Can you cook a meal?
Tom couldn't decide whether to go to Boston or Chicago.
I wrote this song just for you.
You may borrow my car.
May I borrow your headphones?
Tom was homeschooled.
Let it be.
I don't usually dress like this.
"Excuse me, where's the American Embassy?"
Let me know if you need my help.
Get in the car.
Tom told me it might take a while.
Tom is romantic.
Tom tied the canoe to the top of his car.
I'm hungry!
Does she know you?
I am picking apples.
Tom is going to be very disappointed if that happens.
Who was that sitting in front of you at the movies?
Tom is about to get married for the third time.
"That's from Tom, isn't it?"
Are you taking the train?
Why won't Tom listen to me?
Let's start as soon as he comes.
It was this fountain pen that I bought in Paris.
I don't think you should eat that.
"Seeing me, the baby began to cry."
You should make notes.
They look healthy.
"I know you think this is a stupid thing to do, but I plan to do it anyway."
You can't have any of this cake.
This is Mary's dog.
Dolphins and whales are not fish.
This might interest you.
Mary was wearing a tight red dress.
How many years have you lived here?
All you have to do is sit here and wait.
What am I supposed to do with what you gave me?
I'm not feeling too well.
You will be welcome at any time.
I am afraid of dogs.
I've never been so moved.
Tom's great-great-great grandmother lived in Scotland.
Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935.
Did he go home yesterday?
Tom may have been sick.
You know what I want.
I love summer rain.

He is not interested in art at all.
You killed Tom.
I'd say no if I were you.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
You have to listen to Tom.
Tom needs a sharp knife.
We drove back to the motel.
Dry sand absorbs water.
Tom won't let me drive anymore.
This problem demands immediate attention.
Please think about the problem.
Tom will have an answer for you by next week.
We've run out of money.
Tom nearly got me killed.
Why doesn't Tom return my phone calls?
The sea is to fish what the sky is to birds.
They come from the same village.
You always complain about the weather.

Many consumer reviews on Amazon are fake.
That was actually unexpected.

General Montcalm attacked several British forts in 1757.
I've never been to Hokkaido.
He spoke more and more loudly.
Are you sure we've never met before?

Everyone in the class learned the poem by heart.
This pamphlet is free of charge.
He grew up in Australia.
Either Tom is lying or Mary is.
Tom gave me a wink.
How would you feel in this situation if you were Tom?
I haven't quite made up my mind.
Please bear this fact in mind.
I like them both.
Is Tom in trouble again?
We have had lots of typhoons this fall.
What is the total number of students?
You haven't answered my question yet.

"Can we change the subject, please?"
His father had died of cancer 10 years ago.
Tom wanted to talk to me about something.
You'll be hearing from us soon.

It couldn't hurt.
"If you cannot work out the problem, you had better try a different method."
Tom told Mary that he thought it wouldn't be good if she went there by herself.
"You're a good student, but you still have a lot to learn."
Tom owed Mary a lot of money.
It's so warm in this room that I'm sweating.
He received a registered letter.
I hope you know that.
Tom won't let Mary in.
Tom isn't very tall.
"If I had the money, I would immediately buy this computer."
That's not what Tom wants.
I've fallen in love with you.
I don't think it's a good decision.
He became sad when he found out.
He can read well.
How are we feeling today?
I almost had enough money to buy everything I needed.
I pay Tom well.
Everything else doesn't matter now.

I received your message.
How long do you intend to spend at the library?
Could you stand behind my car for a minute and tell me if my brake lights are working?
I need it today.
Don't let Tom eat this.
I'll miss you so much.
I'd rather be poor than rich.
Both girls coughed at the same time.
"Louis Braille, who was blind from the age of three, invented a way for the blind to read."
She kept crying all night.
I was there that night.
We missed the exit.
"I was tired, but continued working."
She didn't let him touch her baby.
Do you want me to say that I'm sorry?
It was a really beautiful day.
There were nice pictures on that wall.
The police expect people to follow the law.
I have to be back home by seven.
We need to save up money to buy a new car.
I've been waiting for him for an hour.
It is essential that we find it.
You have changed so much that I can hardly recognize you.
Tom got an A on his last French test.
Your story is hard to believe.
My father bought this house for us when we got married.
I like drinking beer and wine.
My prayers were answered.
They don't listen.
He wanted to go to sea.
Which one is more expensive?
I am fine.
There is one problem.
"No matter how you do it, the results will be the same."
He raised his hand.
Tom might have cancer.
I don't want to start rumors.
That person died.
Did Tom vote?
Tom thought the same thing I did.
"If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself."
Learning a foreign language is fun.
Are you studying?
I used to drink beer.
When did this occur?
How do you access the Internet?
She kept quiet.
Tom will keep coming.
I think you should sit.
Please speak as slowly as possible.
Everybody looked up.
What's the use?
I bought new shoes at the shoe store.
I expect a subway station will be here in the future.
China is rich in natural resources.
There's hardly anything left to eat.
He doesn't know what to do with his money.
I have to see this movie.
The problem is we don't have enough money.
The shop is closed today.
Don't throw away your chance.
Tom is decorating his room.
Tom is a common name.
Would Tom help us if we asked?
Just check it.
Ask Tom what his sister's name is.
How is the investigation going?
I won't leave this house voluntarily.
How could you do that?
Tom was violent.
Tom looks awkward.
Tom is obviously drunk.
Is that all you want?
I can't imagine why Tom would do something like that.
Tom likes oranges and eats around 3 or 4 of them per week.
Tom gave me his number.
You have to ask Tom first.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom has been reading a book all afternoon.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
There's no need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
I have blue jeans on.
I want a cup of tea.
How will he pay his debts?
I don't agree with you.
There's no shame in that.
I must leave tomorrow morning.
I've thought a lot about what you said.
"Please let me drive your new Toyota, too."
I can't get in touch with Tom.
This is critical.
I saw Tom on Monday.
I'll make you breakfast.
I never would've guessed.
I can't help myself.
That man is in a panic.
I want to sum up this passage for you.
You should spend what little time you have left with your friends.
Here's the one I like.
Tom stepped aside.
Tom decided not to play dodge ball because he wasn't feeling well.
Tom is having trouble coping with the fact that his son committed suicide.
The website is down.
Use acrylic paint.
Do I really remind you of Tom?
I won't do it anymore. I promise.
Tom canceled.
I'm sick of eating fast food.
Tom filled the pot with water and put it on the stove.
I'm not a prince.
You should've never come here.
I'm available in case you need something.
He has blue eyes and fair hair.
This is probably Tom's bicycle.
The rings around Saturn are made up of dust and ice.
I went to the wrong door.
Older carpets are more valuable than newer carpets.
The boys laughed at Tom.
I expect you to follow my orders.
You might have left it in the car.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Let us know whether you can come.
Will you knit a sweater for me?
Her mother is American.
Let's go see Tom.
Tom has a history of drug abuse.
She came to Japan for the purpose of studying Japanese.
We only have one day left.
We go mountain climbing almost every weekend.
Could you please repeat it slowly?
What is your favorite classic rock song?
Why do you guys always ask me that?
You can't take it with you.
The train doesn't stop here.
Things look good.
Can you at least try?
Everyone seems to be happy but me.
Tom hurried out of the classroom.
We're out of wine.
I haven't seen you around here before.
He seems absorbed in his work.
The President left for America this morning.
I remember.
Don't you miss anything?
She was ready to face her fate.
Tom is older than I thought.
I guess Tom forgot to tell you.
Turn left at the next corner.
Love began to grow between the two.
"If it rains tomorrow, we'll not go there."
Tom will arrive in Boston at 2:30.
That medicine worked well for me.
Cats are smarter than you think.
Don't forget to return the book to the library.
He did a pretty good job.
You're welcome to move back to Boston.
"You don't like Tom very much, do you?"
Tom is the one who told me how to do it.
We expected that to happen.
Do you have anything to say regarding this?
We can't let anybody else die.
I'm very tired.
Does he know how you feel?
I'll give him your message when he comes.
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
I want you to go to Osaka at once.
What was Mary's last name before she got married?
What do we have?
I've enjoyed this novel very much.
I'll see you this afternoon.
Tom is really busy.
Behave yourself while I'm gone.
He doesn't sing well.
Are you interested in flowers?
The boy singing a song is my brother.
Tom put his sweater on.
He has his own room.
I plan to leave as soon as I finish this beer.
Those things happen.
Tom helped Mary dye her hair.
You've got to make sure Tom isn't late for school again.
Tom hasn't been on speaking terms with Mary for years.
Would you mind if I help?
Tom drew a picture of a squirrel.
Do you want me to beg?
I see no reason why I shouldn't accept her offer.
Did the Indians invent cigars?
The driver who caused the accident didn't stick around.
I had an out-of-body experience.
How was your trip?
I wish Tom were my younger brother.
How did you answer Tom?
My sister expects to graduate from college next year.
It's every man for himself.
That has nothing to do with him.
It is already dark.
There is plenty of food.
I loved it.
Tom might hear you.
The pond is too shallow for swimming.
Do you remember when you last saw Tom?
I want to say hello to Tom.
Tom said hello to Mary.
I can't thank you enough.
Is there something you're not telling me?
She hit him again and again.
Tom wants to watch.
Mary likes you.
You're very observant.
The mountain is covered with snow.
Tom corrected himself.
She helped the old man across the street.
Tom is watching Mary.
I have a new bicycle.
What are you doing right now?
Tom lived with his uncle in Boston while going to college.
Tom's finished.
Tom tried to flush the drugs down the toilet.
Tell me where you plan to go for your summer vacation.
"Both Tom and Mary have Boston addresses, even though they don't live there now."
I've taken care of everything.
Get off my lawn.
I have reason to think that we'll never see Tom again.
"Admit it, we're lost."
Don't you ever come back.
We need lumber to build a barn.
What's the best way to get in touch with you?
Can you leave it with me till this afternoon?
Tom put his hand on Mary's shoulder.
I was expecting you last night.
He's a very zealous worker.
It's about to explode!
This is critical.
Read this.
Do you think it's worthwhile? I don't think so.
"Where are my glasses? ""You've left them on the kitchen table."""
There are enough seats for everyone.
I won fair and square.
Call me this evening.
You may use my typewriter.
He must have been brought up in a good family.
I didn't know what was happening.
Tom made Mary do that.
Give me that.
Tom thought the car Mary was driving wasn't safe.
It's seven o'clock.
It's against my religion.
"I'm not sure, but I think I hate Tom."
Tom turned a somersault.
How many pens do you have?
How long have you been here in Boston?
The elevator isn't running.
Tom and I were married to each other for three years.
Their teacher praised them.
"Tom is a medical student, isn't he?"
I know you're talented.
I believe we've seen enough.
There are 340 species of hummingbirds.
Keep it up.
She drives me crazy.
I saw you.
"Help yourself to the cookies, Tom."
Fill the tires with air.
We can't do that either.
He was compelled to sign the contract.
She just left.
Good for you.
"They seldom, if ever, speak in French."
You won't believe who I just saw.
The road was muddy and slippery.
He is just the man for the job.
I don't recognize this shirt. Whose is it?
My brother's six years younger than I am.
I won't forget what you did.
Do you think I'm pretty?
The man is checking in at a hotel.
I feel so lonely.
Tom went into the kitchen to get some coffee.
Who made this cake?
I saw Tom less than an hour ago.
This makes me curious.
The problem will resolve itself eventually.
Can you use a computer?
Tom promised it would never happen again.
I am proud to work with you.
Tom lowered himself into the water.
The train is ten minutes behind today.
Nobody'll ever find us here.
Tom arrived on Monday.
I don't see him.
Tom wants to learn how to knit.
Why don't you slow down a little bit?
Why didn't you listen to his advice?
We all have stomachaches.
Mary looks hot.
"Tom looked around the room, but he didn't see Mary."
We found them here.
Some parents don't punish their children when they lie.
Tom shouldn't have let Mary drive.
We've always done it this way.
I'm very happy with the result.
Where's your friend?
Is Tom still coming?
I was ready.
"We did our best to help him, but he didn't so much as say thank you."
We had hardly reached there when it began to rain.
"If you change your mind, let us know."
We just can't take that chance.
That guard tends to do everything by the book.
Tom likes Tchaikovsky.
You're very courageous.
That's no reason to apologize.
I need money badly.
Are you Catholic?
I saw Tom tonight.
I'm not a patient person.
Tom is very good at doing that.
Tom never returns my calls.
"After his bankruptcy, he wasn't able to get back on his feet."
She had never dreamed of meeting him abroad.
That store supplies us with coffee.
Do you think he resembles his father?
"I'm 17, too."
She does whatever comes into her mind.
He was covered with sweat.
His son took on the management of the factory.
Please remember to mail this letter.
I don't really use Facebook that much.
Tom sent me a funny text message.
Why did you call me?
He grew up in Germany.
He painted the ceiling blue.
The war was finally brought to a close.
How well did you know Tom?
Can we afford it?
What impressed you the most?
He dropped to his knees.
I'm in constant danger.
I wish I hadn't believed Tom.
You ought to have seen it.
You never should've left your husband.
Where is the missing dollar?
Don't kid yourself.
I hope everything's going well with you.
Tom worked for almost three hours.
You might not want to go there by yourself.
Why didn't you get married?
I am playing volleyball now.
You hardly ever laugh.
Tom isn't nasty.
"He seems like a respectable businessman, but he's really part of the Mafia."
You look very tired.
Who would you like to speak to?
There's nothing more you can do for me.
It's too heavy to move.
I'm leaving it to you.
When do you return home?
We can do a lot more.
I hid it in my sock drawer.
"Hold on a moment, please."
We need your help.
You should call your mother more often.
He is one of my best friends.
I can look after myself.
That's the eject button. Don't touch it.
I seem to have lost my appetite.
It's the only way.
She is as beautiful as ever.
It's time we went home.
No one will believe us.
Tom stayed in the hotel.
"I got up at six, ate breakfast and then went to school."
There is an urgent need for blood donations.
How can it be done?
It's not a good idea to date your neighbor.
The room was cold.
Tom took off his headphones.
Laws are necessary.
We can't work under these conditions.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
Tom turned to Mary and asked her a question.
You look incredible.
I long for company.
I need to know tomorrow.
Why did you come to Japan?
My father stopped drinking.
"You can't read French, can you?"
He will regret this.
What am I going to say?
See you tomorrow.
Where's my daddy?
You're going to need all the help you can get.
He believes that he can prove it.
Have you ever given a speech in French?
He was not pleased.
You underestimate me.
Tom asked Mary to call him later.
Is this the girl you spoke well of the other day?
It turned out to be true.
He can't be smart if he can screw up something like that.
You're working hard.
You can come with us.
Tom will recover.
I'll give it to you.
We'll be across the border by tomorrow.
What kind of teacher do you want to be?
Rubies are one of most beautiful gems in the world.
Tom has finally returned to Boston after living in Chicago for three years.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I threw the paper into the flames.
Tom knows what it's about.
Tom hasn't yet told us what he wants.
He doesn't love his girlfriend.
How did you figure out this problem?
Tom flinched.
You are not to speak to him while he is studying.
I'm not ready.
What should I do now?
We still have an old tube television.
Can that really be coincidence?
Can it be phrased in another way?
Tom always wears his seatbelt.
Tom's car was rear-ended and he suffered a whiplash injury.
I've packed my suitcases already.
Tom put his books in his locker.
Is there a vacant seat?
We now live in Boston.
The theory is not accepted.
We should probably go home.
Tom is afraid to go out at night.
Tom made a complete fool of himself.
I know all your secrets.
We have lunch at about noon.
Tom was charming.
I like to dance with Mary.
There's no one home.
I want to know why you did that.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
I hate being taken advantage of.
It's still Monday.
That was a new experience for me.
What are you going to do after graduating from college?
I asked Tom if he wanted to drive.
Tom got involved with people who had a really bad influence on him.
He took over the business after her death.
I wouldn't want you to think I was mean.
I got something in my eye.
I love sports.
Tom put a knife to my throat.
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her.
Tell me your names.
Country life is healthier than city life.
I know that you're disappointed.
Tom shuffled off.
We never went on family vacations because we were too poor.
The room was crowded with furniture.
Do you have any idea how important your test grades are?
I love the way you laugh.
A drunken man was sleeping on the bench.
You've got a lot of guts.
It'll be hard for me to wake you up.
Both sisters are very beautiful.
That's what you have to do.
Tom's voice trembled slightly.
We ignored Tom.
He quarrels with every person he knows.
She looked around her room.
I can open the window.
This beach is a paradise for surfers.
I'll be back in a while.
Tom didn't think he could trust Mary.
I'll be very careful.
Do you go to school by bus or by train?
I always liked Tom.
I don't know anything about his past.
There is a curious story about an Englishman.
Be careful not to fail.
I am washing my brother's car.
Stand up straight when I'm talking to you!
The two families have very close ties.
I had fun doing that.
I'm the same height as Tom is.
"You've been here a long time, haven't you?"
It was a traumatic experience.
You can't talk to me like this.
Stop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.
The mother didn't know what to do with her son.
She ironed his shirts.
Mary is still wearing the ring Tom gave her.
Tom likes Mary.
How many children do you have?
Tom found out what went wrong.
It's a true story.
"One for all, and all for one, this is our motto."
Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
Soldiers must carry out their orders.
I love your daughter.
My father said he would reserve a day to take me to the zoo.
We arrived on the island two days later.
We're fighting.
What's the date of the letter?
Why don't you go there?
Tom eats tofu quite often because he heard that it was healthy.
My computer's acting strange.
Who did you see?
Are you going to Tom's party tomorrow?
Which skirt do you like?
What makes you think I want this?
I was married here.
Tom was caught cheating on an exam.
Tom went downtown this afternoon.
I was hoping you might be able to tell me where Tom is.
They admired the scenic view from the hill.
It's because you're an idiot.
I had mosquito bites all over my legs when I woke up this morning.
A good deed never goes unpunished.
It's Tom's duty.
Why do they say you have to learn English to survive?
Could I get my ring back?
How is this even possible?
Which one do you like better?
He liked making decisions.
Tom lay awake almost all night thinking about Mary.
Her answer was incorrect.
"As soon as she saw me, she greeted me with a smile."
There were plenty of guests in the hall.
I can't really put a price on that.
Tom isn't good-looking.
I hear you.
She lowered her standards.
You don't need to stand up.
I guess I'll find out soon enough.
I'd like to look at that graph.
He knows how to recognize aliens.
Tom disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer.
She believes whatever he says.
Germany did not want war with the United States.
Hitler assumed power in 1933.
The soldier groaned with pain.
That's what people don't understand.
Have you fed the dog?
It didn't seem to bother Tom in the least.
Mary is working as a model.
Tom says he's studying French.
Do you want the job?
I doubt that Tom had to sell his car in order to raise money for medical expenses.
What time does the store open?
I'm able to speak French.
I tried really hard.
There were a dozen suspects in the case.
It's within walking distance.
He still has three servants.
Tom described to the police officer how the accident had happened.
I found it quite impressive.
Have you fed the dog yet?
Have you already decided how you're going to take care of this problem?
You gain nothing by speaking ill of others.
The children were standing in line.
I used to play alone when I was a child.
I make it a rule to study English for 3 hours every day.
Have you been keeping something from me?
You're a very pretty girl.
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
We require your help.
You can do better than that.
How much did Tom pay you to mow the lawn?
This book is to me what the Bible is to you.
I'm tired of your complaints.
Are you scared of me?
Have you already voted?
I met him once.
Tom has very few photos of himself as a baby.
I'm coming to your party.
You don't have to make up your mind right now.
She explained the reason why she was late.
I'll let Tom know.
Tom wants you.
I like to learn ancient languages.
Tom told us some jokes.
"There was an earthquake and, in addition, there was a tsunami."
Tom is quite popular.
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Tom wants Mary to say that she needs him.
How's the world treating you?
It's about time you settled down for good.
I've seen a lot of strange things in my life.
That child stuck out his tongue at me.
I wish you had come with us.
She can ask and answer questions.
A honeymoon in Canada costs a lot of money.
This movie is so unrealistic.
Tom is eager to meet Mary again.
He pays no attention to others' feelings.
We can't really do anything until we get permission from Tom.
The new store is going to open next week.
I want a family.
You could've died.
Tom became disillusioned after working on Wall Street for a few years.
Obviously that's different for men and women.
Tom is interested in golf.
Tom is a lousy kisser.
I am leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
What're you thinking about?
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
He's looking for a job.
Don't believe anything they say.
Tom didn't take the news very well.
Do you have a hunting license?
Go wake Tom up.
Why are you in such a bad mood today?
It was impossible for me to answer this question.
I'll take him.
You have no messages.
I came yesterday.
"A bad habit, once formed, is difficult to get rid of."
Tom and I hardly ever see each other anymore.
Don't let the fire burn out.
How many students are there in total?
Tom waited impatiently.
"It's mine, not his."
I can't let them catch me.
I don't have a sister.
"Tom is very unsociable, isn't he?"
Does Tom have a girlfriend?
I seldom eat dairy products.
You're humming.
There he is.
His theory is based on fact.
Tom really wants you to stay here with us.
"Tom is allergic to bees, hornets and wasps."
You're not dressed.
I can't steal for you.
I won't be coming back.
Fishing is not allowed here.
Isn't it great?
I'd like to be a teacher.
Is this your first time in Korea?
Do you recycle?
Tom and Mary left together.
We must be alert to dangers.
We have you to thank for it.
Tell us something.
I know that some of your students don't like you.
I suppose you know everything Tom did.
Can you do it in one day?
Why isn't Tom helping Mary?
Tom said it was none of my business.
I'll let you know when she arrives.
I just want things to be normal.
He owns a very valuable wristwatch.
A strange feeling came over me.
Tom didn't want to hurt Mary's feelings.
It isn't expensive.
Can anyone here speak French?
They aren't hungry.
That's not quite right.
"This tool, if used carelessly, can be very dangerous."
That chair goes in the corner.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom has visited Boston three times.
Why are you always so cynical?
We have no way to verify this.
You know you can trust me.
The book's illustrations are very good.
Is he tall?
I didn't catch what he said.
I wish I could understand you better.
Tom is not fond of pets.
He is still angry.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I have done what I could.
Did you have a nice summer?
I was on leave.
I will confirm my plane reservation.
Tom told Mary to go home.
Tom can do it better than me.
Have courage.
Tom finally contacted Mary by phone.
Did Tom stay long?
Tom is better at speaking French than Mary is.
The ship carried hundreds of emigrants to the US.
He is superior to her in math.
Tom was holding a small box in his hands.
Tom says it's an emergency.
What's in this stew?
There's a party after work.
I remember them.
To investigate the incident would take us at least three weeks.
We're planning to do just that.
The kettle is whistling on the stove.
Who did you vote for?
We're here to protect you.
Where does Tom want to live?
We knew that.
Have a good look at this picture.
Tom is much shorter than Mary is.
I heard someone call my name in the crowd.
Is anyone coming besides your friends?
Tom had nothing.
Tom has been wounded.
What are you getting out of this?
Tom went to a Halloween party.
Tom doesn't know how to start a lawn mower.
Tom helped Mary in the garden.
He assured me of his help.
Worrying never did anyone any good.
The wound has not healed yet.
What's it worth to you?
I think you're hot.
I'm going to shoot him dead.
Have you picked out a name yet for the baby?
I can't take it any more.
I'm very afraid.
Tom asked Mary where she had been.
I have been to Europe twice.
Cut the melon into six equal pieces.
I'd rather die than surrender.
Ask your question.
Get out of the classroom.
Why don't we head back?
Tom lent me three books.
The car is not available today.
Are you generous?
They mistook him for his brother.
The accident took place near that intersection.
Who did you talk to?
The teacher caught the student cheating on the examination.
Tom said you were too busy to talk to us.
Tom emigrated to Australia when he was thirty.
Tom can't believe Mary's over thirty.
We haven't tried the drug out on humans yet.
Tom is a lot smarter than Mary.
Don't accept drinks from strangers.
Is this really allowed?
You're incompetent.
This could come in handy.
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
What a pity!
Did you understand what he said?
She scolded her daughter for coming home too late.
Leave Tom alone or you'll regret it.
I have to go to Boston with Tom.
I'll have to meet you there.
Something similar happened to me.
My hands are shaking.
This question is one of great importance.
I cannot thank you enough for your assistance.
It's not your style.
I've decided to give Tom the promotion.
We thought it wise not to continue our trip.
Tom is enraged.
"If it rains, the excursion will be called off."
Tom can cook very well.
Tom isn't as patient as you.
The fire started in the kitchen.
Stir the soup until it boils.
Nothing's been changed.
Don't lose your temper.
I asked Tom if he would mind doing that.
He plays the piano better than me.
Tom got up early in order to catch the first train.
We should consider the problem from a child's perspective.
Do you know who they are?
I bet you think I'm just writing that to impress you.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
Tom's phone buzzed.
What's Tom's job?
Do you know the reason?
Do you know what this says?
He asked her some questions.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Tom will be exhausted when he gets home.
Tom said he asked himself that same question.
I've heard of you.
I think you'll want this.
Why don't you want to go?
Would you like to go to a movie tomorrow night?
Tom stuck up for me.
Tom is watching television.
I need a pair of new shoes.
He is a complete stranger to me.
Is it always so awful in April?
Do you know what AMP means?
It's sort of strange.
Tom is very good at videogames.
How did you enjoy the concert?
What're you reading?
I disagree with just about everything Tom just said.
We can't do this without you.
Tom is very wise.
You ought to have told me that before.
I'll leave this work to you.
I can't find my red hat anywhere.
Tell me how to spell the word.
Why is it the mass media didn't report this?
We must work hard to break down social barriers.
I have a daughter who's married to a Frenchman.
What is all the fuss about?
He was satisfied with his new car.
I have a wife and kids.
Everybody knows we don't like each other.
"Tom's eyes weren't yet accustomed to the dark, so he couldn't see a thing."
Tom thanked Mary for the present.
My family loved Tom.
We can rely on Tom.

The back of my neck hurts.
More and more students are joining the protests.
I don't like this kind of joke.

We apologize for the inconvenience.
She has many friends in Hong Kong.
I was born in 1972.
Nice timing.
I saw Tom in the library yesterday.
That report was important because it pointed out all the errors the committee had made.
I can't believe that people think Tom is intelligent.
How many people are here today?
I'll call you a taxi.
"Witches don't exist, but bad people do."
Tom likes doing that here.
My wife showed excellent taste in decorating the room.
Tom never talks about his job.
"Whose cats are these? ""They are Fatima's."""
Tell us something.
He praised the girl for her honesty.
We'll come back later.
Your suitcase is too heavy.
Tom asked a question.
Anyone home?
What time will Tom arrive in Boston?
The sky is clear almost every day.
I can't save you.
You don't have to go to the party unless you want to.
Tom clenched his fists angrily.
I have work for Tom.
That's perfectly natural.
She has a piano lesson once a week.
I know that most people here don't like doing that.

That's where I want to go.
This bird can imitate the human voice.
Let's get together again tomorrow evening.
I think that he will succeed.
He used to love that.
Her fiancé gave her a very big ring.
"Tom, I'm here."
"Basically, I agree with your opinion."
Take me home.
Rest assured that I will do my best.
"Think about it, OK?"
"When we saw what was happening there, we decided to leave."
Do you know how to use this camera?
I take the bus to work every day.
We always want what we can't have.
I hate myself sometimes.
How much money do I owe you?
Tom saved my life.
I don't understand your question.
He asked me to pass him the salt.
I miss you.
I'll definitely never do that again.
I met him by pure chance.
Just look at those legs.
Tom brought that.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
Tom was late for work.
Everybody waited.
Do what you believe is right.
Call me if there's a change.
What is the book about?
Stop that!
Where is the railway station?
He gave in.
I think you're ready.

You're lying to me.
Tom says he's Canadian.
Enjoy your food.
Count me in.
"Up until now, they've been good neighbors."
Tom doesn't have to do this.
Are they friends?
He is doing a super job.
We have a colleague in Spain.
"You know the way, don't you?"
He looks like your brother.
No one was interested in what I had to say.
I saw Tom kiss Mary.

Tom got an unexpected visit from Mary.
Do you know the answer?
Boys are not welcome.
The road is ten feet in width.
Could you please stop singing?
I took Tom's blood pressure.
You have totally lost your mind.
I'll finish reading this novel soon.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
Can't you leave me alone?
I'd like some ice cream.
"You're not going, are you?"
His birthday is May 5th.

I could do with a change of pace.
It's already happening.

"I'm sorry, today is fully booked."
This is Tom.
I ran so I would be on time.
You must not leave right now.
It'll soon be spring.
Let's get started.
They've turned on us.
Tom has done more than anyone else.
The two of us are finally alone.
I'm happy doing what I do.
Tom isn't going to be happy to see me.
What do you believe in?
The air conditioner makes too much noise.
How was Tom able to lose so much weight so quickly?
Tom is obviously very popular.
I'm not certain.
I think Tom might be telling the truth.
That was very considerate of Tom.
Wake up.
Don't despise a man just because he is poorly dressed.
I didn't think of that.
It's a windy day.
I love ice cream.
I don't need a break.
Is this your first visit to Japan?
Are you content with your position in the company?
Do you have small change?
I remember my childhood well.
I want you with me.
Do you know where my watch is?
I don't see what that has to do with this.
Is that book for me?
I didn't get a reply.

I think Tom is skinny.
I've told you everything I remember.
He is very stingy with his money.
Tom and Mary haven't been married long.
I neither drink nor smoke.
Tom is just pretending to be your friend.
When would it be convenient for you?
That's not what I ordered.
Could you change my room for me?
No one can escape.
You don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
He eats nothing other than fruit.
The tie doesn't go with my suit.
It is both good and cheap.
Did you bring your family with you?
Tom has had so many chances to do the right thing.
Someone parked in my spot.
It seems that you don't want me to succeed.
The path twists through the mountains.
Tom is likely to arrive before 2:30.
Are you busy these days?
Can you give me a ride?
Tom does that sometimes.
Tom isn't afraid.
Stop doing that.
"What are you thinking about? ""I'm thinking about you."""
"If you're not prepared to take the trouble to learn how to train a dog, don't get one."
Tom does not look happy.
I got up about five.
Ask me anything you want.
Do you want money?
"How old are you? ""I'm sixteen."""
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
Do you want another one of these?
We know about that.
Do you want to see a picture of Tom?
The story of a great flood is very common in world mythology.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
It has nothing to do with the subject we are discussing.
That's not what I said at all.
Tom wants this.
"You knew that, right?"
Anyone can make a mistake.
His answer was to strike me on the head.
Nobody wants to talk about that.
Tom speaks French very well.
What did I do to deserve this?
Ask Tom where Mary lives.
I don't have a lot of money.
I'm used to driving a truck.
We'll have to make do with what we have.
She sent him a long letter.
I'll miss you after you've gone.

How long does it take?
Guess what he told me.
We want to see Tom do that.
My mother was very weak from a long illness.
Tom is Mary's adopted brother.
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
Do you have any vacant rooms?
It's a large amount.
I'm not at all scared.
Why do you want that?
Tom doesn't like the color of the walls in his bedroom.
I've enjoyed this novel very much.
What time does the bank open?
We got to the station at six.
Tom wanted you to know.
Tom sat down on the bed.
Can you count in French?
Asking a woman how old she is is not a good idea.
This is a time of rejoicing.
What's going on down there?
This milk has gone bad.
Tom said he doesn't think that Mary will do that again.
I'll see this doesn't happen again.
Rural life appeals to me very much.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.
What've you been doing recently?
She has broken the toaster again.
I had to do everything alone.
Tom became calm.

He lost his honor.
How many hours do you work per week?
Silence makes some people nervous.
He is far from happy.
The investigation will probably bring a lot of details to light.
Mary likes to wear flowers in her hair.
Tom looked embarrassed.
Is French your native language?
I need to have a talk with you.
I'm hoping you'll tell me how to do this.
She works as a secretary in an office.
His wife kicked him out of the house.
Someone screamed.
I won't let anything happen to you.
All we know is that Tom is guilty.
I can check that for you.
"Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes."
I'll buy you a beer.
How was your summer?
Are you sure that you haven't forgotten anything?
Where's the source of this river?

Mary's dream of going abroad finally became a reality.
I hate this rug.
I was caught in a shower on my way to the station.
The room was dark.
Tom was attracted to Mary from the moment he first saw her.
You can't blame this on us.
Stop right there.
"This is his car, I think."
You did so much better this time.
What you say is true.
Stay for a while.
I think Tom misses you.
I just can't do it.
We talked about basketball.
"If you are to succeed, you must try harder."
Tell me where you're going.
You're picking up some bad habits from us.
I don't think I said that.
"Like many students at our school, Tom stays up until late at night studying."
I'll go for a walk if the weather improves.
That's how it is.
I'll cook.
Tom knew this.
I know you well enough to know that you didn't really want to go out with Tom.
I have your dog with me.

It won't be pleasant.
I've heard that if you drink beer you are more likely to be bitten by mosquitoes than if you don't drink beer.
He wanted to meet you.
It seems like the cat caught the scent of a mouse.
Don't disturb me while I'm studying.

We've got to start doing that.

Nobody was listening.

They're going.
I really can't understand it.

I want to know the reason.
We are students.
What did you do with my baggage?

I think we're being followed.
Let us know whether you can come.
Don't sign the contract with a pencil.
Tom lent me his French textbook.
My father doesn't allow me to go to the movies alone.
He can't come with us.
He lives in that house over there.
French is a very interesting language.
"I'm sorry to trouble you, but could you tell me the way to the station?"
Does Tom like French?
You aren't allowed to do that.
I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the monkey.
He took me for my twin brother.
Do I really have to drink that?
"Tom's father comes home once in a while, but he never sticks around for long."
I met her by chance.
I heard that he'd died.
Complaining about something is one way to adapt yourself to a new environment.

You're safe in here.
Tom was frank.
Can we get help for Tom?

Would you like me to help you with washing the dishes?

Who helps her?
I got up early yesterday.
Please stop it.
I'll stay home and study.
How can you eat so much?
You're just wasting your time.
This is the opposite of what I expected.
We don't need them.
That's enough.
I'll buy you a new one.
I am busy now and can't play with you.
You must have a reason for telling me.
Please take more care in the future.

The teacher explained the meaning of the word to us.
You can stay here till the snow stops.
We can count on Tom.
I only hope that that is enough.
Have you ever had food poisoning?
Tom is a brave man.
He pushed past me.
It's about time.
How did you do?
I don't work there anymore.
I'm left-handed.
Is this hat yours?
I don't even know where she is right now.
Tom thinks Mary is kind of cute.
How many symphonies did Beethoven write?
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
Did you have anything to do with this?
He looks confused.
This ought to be fun.
We know it's not going to work.
Tom tried to save me.
It's just what I needed.
This car handles well.
He kept me waiting for more than an hour.
Did Tom say where we should meet him?
He really wants to buy a new motorcycle.
Tom isn't up yet.
Your plan seems excellent.
I've been misunderstood.
It's a lot easier than I thought.
My watch is different from yours.
I couldn't help but cry.
There are still many things left to do.
The pain she suffered while being tortured was unimaginable.
Tom comes here every day.
You don't have to worry about a thing like that.
He gave them food and money.
I wish I could be in Boston now.
Our car broke down in the middle of the street.
Tom couldn't have done it without you.
"When I painted this picture, I was 23 years old."
There were stacks of books all over the floor.
When did you go to work?
"First, we have to find out where they live."
Tom is looking for someone to help him build a wall.
"Tom's handwriting isn't very good, but it's easy to read."
Tom was willing to try anything.
Tom kept eating.
Tom is odd.
Did you buy a new car?
"At last, they came to a decision."
It's time to leave.
"Tom held one of Mary's hands, and John held the other."
I hope I can keep up with you.
Can't you just accept that?
Japan has been sending athletes to the Olympics since 1912.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
Turn up the TV.
Tom and Mary gave exactly the same answers on the test which made the teacher suspicious.
I'd like you to stay and help me clean up.
Tom likes to observe the people walking by.
It took Tom a long time to get over Mary's death.
That's what I'm asking you to do.
Tom has a hunch.
Don't do it! It's stupid and dangerous.
I go to school with Tom.
She looked very beautiful in her new dress.
You have absolutely nothing to fear.
Mary went to the ladies' room.
I wouldn't like to be in Tom's shoes.
I have to be home for dinner.
You're not normal.
What's the secret ingredient?
That's exactly what I want.
I need some water.
He smoked a cigar after lunch.
I thought you were off today.
I have no one to talk to.
Nobody wants Tom.
She tore the letter into a thousand pieces.
He has great confidence in himself.
I thought you'd already talked to Tom.
"You don't want to talk to me, do you?"
Everybody was staring at me.
He is free from care.
Tom wants a watch like yours.
I think you can help us.
It's hard to please him.
Just get me the list.
We must take good care of ourselves.
Water was coming out of the damaged pipe.
Tom could still hear Mary crying in the next room.
Nowadays nobody believes in ghosts.
"He was impolite, not to say rude."
Make your bed.
You're quite mistaken.
The cathedral's clock just struck three.
Is that man over there Tom?
I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
Tom looked around to make sure they were alone.
I meant it as a joke.
Tom's third marriage was unhappy and he was considering yet another divorce.
There's got to be a way.
"You know where it is, don't you?"
We walked to the river.
Do you like French literature?
You can do it at your leisure.
Same-sex marriage is legal here.
Tom cried all night.
I'm nervous and excited.
How cute!
How dare you say such a thing to me!
When are you going to pick Tom up at the airport?
She came out of there.
Living conditions were hard.
I bought a lot of books.
"Common sense tells us, however, that there is no easy solution."
English is the world's language.
Tom didn't do it.
Look at that picture.
Do you have anything further to say?
It's likely Tom and Mary will get married in the near future.
Tom's very hard-working.
He died five years ago.
"You don't speak French, do you?"
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom sat down on one of the barstools.
"When Tom was walking down the street at night, a man he didn't know threatened him with a knife and robbed him of his cash."
Tom said this to me.
The first round is on the house.
I only need two more minutes.
Can't we go with Tom?
I missed the train. I should have come earlier.
What if your parents find out?
A good sailor only requires a short time to get his sea legs.
I am mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
I've come up with a brilliant idea.
Tom hopes that Mary will like the present he bought for her.
All of us were silent.
Tom has been waiting for more than three hours.
It fits perfectly.
Let's play ball.
I need you to listen.
I've just washed the dishes.
Tom is seeking a job.
It's a fungus.
Why is Tom hiding?
This new necktie goes well with the suit.
We're working on it.
Do you wear glasses?
Don't get nervous.
Please keep this money for me.
Tom's body was found along a deserted road.
I guess Tom was right.
"Tom isn't afraid of snakes, even poisonous ones."
It was very simple.
I'll get there in an hour.
Tom has a pounding headache.
This annoys me.
Tom just needs a little rest.
He is five feet tall.
Tom dropped in to see us.
Do you want fries with that?
You're going to like this.
They left it to me to decide on a gift.
Tom learned shorthand from Mary.
Do you know the concert schedule of London Symphony Orchestra?
Tom and the others ran out of the building.
You never know who's watching.
It's obviously a typo.
That's why I came.
She complained about my low salary.
I didn't get an invitation to Tom's party.
What does that have to do with you?
Tom kissed Mary and then went to work.
I'm prettier than Mary.
Tom is suspicious of Europeans.
Were you in Australia last summer?
Come sit down.
I hugged her.
"After getting through customs, I was free to go wherever I wanted."
Tom told Mary to study harder.
Place your bets.
Was this supposed to be funny?
That girl is really shy.
I will see to it that everything is ready in time.
It must be hard for you.
I'll take your word for it.
Tom knows Mary is rich.
She made it clear that she couldn't make it in time for the meeting.
I'll let you know tomorrow.
You're uninteresting.
Mary's closet is full of clothes that she never wears.
Pork has a lot of fat.
I want to go outside for a breath of fresh air.
Tom said he didn't want anything.
I will give you this book.
Tom didn't know that Mary liked to cook.
Everything's negotiable.
Tom wanted to write something.
I just need a little time.
Mary is like my own daughter.
I want Tom to stop.
She has only bitter memories of her time with them.
Would you like another glass of wine?
He spoke in a broken English that was hard to understand.
No one knows where Tom's gone.
"I saw her five days ago, he said."
Do you want to stop Tom?
I just lost at the races so I'm flat broke.
What a hot day it is!
Someone called.
You of all people should appreciate that.
Could you help us after school?
Tom is in the prime of his life.
"All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses."
The police officer put handcuffs on the suspect.
Hand me that broom.
Orange juice is the most popular juice in America.
Tom tried to help the old lady.
Are we all going to die?
Set Tom free.
They entered the jungle.
"If you ever need a job, go see Tom."
It takes two to tango.
Hello again.
My study is upstairs.
England is going to win the match.
Tom almost always wears sunglasses.
I'd like to have a word with you.
Please tell me what that is.
Let's clear up this problem.
Please wait for me.
Tom threw me an apple.
Tom never walks barefoot.
Does Tom know you're here?
"Can we have a menu, please?"
I know the whole story.
It will soon be breakfast time.
Boys spend less time on homework than girls.
Both children were punished.
Where is Tom from?
I am nothing but a poor peasant.
I've never seen you so nervous.
Tom didn't understand my French.
That won't be hard to do.
They took off after Tom.
Where do you want us to go?
"If I had known the news, I would have told you."
I can walk to school in ten minutes.
Mary left the door ajar and Tom could overhear what she was saying.
The bridge is under construction.
The train stopped in Baltimore.
Let me see what's in your hand.
My friend was arrested for speeding.
"For here, or to go?"
"In spite of the heavy rain, he visited his friend in the hospital."
You look very tired.
I have many things to do.
All the rooms are taken.
The mist is clearing.
Tom has a Ford.
She became rich by virtue of hard work and good business sense.
What do you mean?
I agree with all my heart.
The telephone was invented in 1876 by Bell.
The river flows too fast to swim in.
Tom went bananas.
Who wants to know?
There's so much I want to show you.
Wait here until we get back.
I'm glad to see you.
Something was about to happen.
I don't even know where Tom lives.
We long for peace.
"If you spend too much time in the sun without putting on sunscreen, you are likely to get a sunburn."
Tom is cooperating.
I don't speak a word of French.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
I will go at 10.
What were you doing when I called you yesterday?
It didn't take you long to get here.
Tom would like to stay young forever.
Girls aren't welcome.
I'm washing my hands because they're dirty.
It's a present for you.
This river is deepest here.
Tom pretended not to understand French.
His parents hate me.
What Tom did was very wrong.
It's 8:00 p.m.
There must be a better way of doing this.
How long have you been dating?
Hardly anyone thinks that we are sisters.
Tom threatened them.
Can I eat?
Mary is saving money so she can go to Japan.
I'm looking forward to doing this again.
She took a deep breath and then started to talk about herself.
You must hurry up.
Can you pronounce these words?
No one is waiting at the bus stop. We may have missed the bus.
Tom put the book back on the shelf where it belonged.
Tom sang better than Mary.
No one's stopping you.
When does the rainy season in Japan begin?
I put the receiver to my ear.
Mind your own business.
When will it be convenient for you?
She is not as young as she looks.
I will teach you how to play chess.
There's no cure for baldness.
I never thought I'd finish it.
All you have to do is press the button.
My teacher told me that I should have spent more time preparing my presentation.
Tom still intends to go.
That's a splendid idea.
Mary likes to wear flowers in her hair.
I'd like not to do it.
We know you're in here.
This is nonsense.
I'd appreciate that.
Tom died a happy man.
Wasn't he your boyfriend?
I want to find out what kind of food Tom wants to eat.
This is insane.
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing.
We're new at this.
"Hello, girls."
When did Tom graduate?
You will find this in a hardware store.
Did Tom win the race?
My horse ran away.
I don't want meat.
I wish I'd been born Canadian.
Delete his name from the list.
Tom tended to the horses.
I'm going to the police.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
You'll be dead someday.
Your mother is in critical condition.
Are you sure Tom hasn't been lying to us?
How many people do you know well?
She tried to swim.
Girls talk too much.
Tom is Mary's husband's best friend.
Father is in his office.
I can't figure out how this happened.
What sports do you like?
I think you're going to be OK.
I'm used to sleeping in a tent.
Tom and Mary reached for the doorknob at the same time.
Tom lives all by himself.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
Tom is full.
Don't do it for me.
My umbrella protects me from the rain.
You can't judge a person if you don't know him well.
Don't worry about me so much.
All this damage is the result of the storm.
Tom couldn't look at Mary.
They are accustomed to hard work.
What are you afraid of?
I didn't say anything.
This city is not so busy as it used to be.
Tom and Mary discussed their future plans together.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
"Mom, I'm hungry."
Do you know those people?
Behave yourself during my absence.
Tom said he didn't know Mary's address.
Tom stayed at a hotel.
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
She is obstinate.
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
He still loves her.
"If you want to be a good father, you need to spend time with your children."
We can't keep on fooling ourselves.
Everyone looked.
How could Tom be so stupid?
Tom would never forgive himself if anything happened to Mary.
Thank you for telling me.
When can we move in?
Tom divorced Mary and married Alice.
Tom shouted at Mary.
Tom had a cat.
I reported the theft of my car to the police.
Are you still angry?
The bridge is being repaired.
Leave the food on the table.
You're tough.
We have to find out who did this.
He'll do his best to finish the job.
They stayed up until dawn.
He comes to see me nearly every day.
His teeth are yellow from smoking too much.
Tom likes word games.
I was the one who suggested it.
She heard him sing.
Tom is a complete loser.
I've never used a hacksaw before. Could you show me how?
They were all surprised to see me there.
Tom chose not to respond.
Do you know how I can get there?
"Tom, can you come tomorrow?"
What made you say such a stupid thing as that?
She waited for hours and hours.
Leave it to us.
Does Tom enjoy it?
Tom isn't poor.
I've never heard Tom speak French.
I was humiliated in public.
This is the tallest tower in Japan.
"Tom is fast, isn't he?"
I'm very good at math.
This photo was taken in Nara.
They applauded.
Tom saved Mary a seat.
My sister works at the United States Embassy in London.
I refuse to do it.
Is this your cat?
It's almost dark.
Tom tried to stop it from happening.
I had my watch stolen last night.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
Tom knew why Mary slapped John.
She is running.
We're not leaving without you.
I already told Tom that.
Tom felt Mary's hand on his shoulder.
It's not easy.
Leave out this word.
Don't be crazy.
Where's my car?
We rented a canoe.
Why are they doing that?
It's hard being a politician.
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
He likes to work in the garden.
I was very tired so I went to bed early.
I should have done this years ago.
I don't know how I did that.
We just didn't expect it.
"Show me a cheaper one, please."
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go with him.
This is the very book I have been looking for.
I don't want to go shopping by myself.
He went to sea when he was only 14.
I don't know where Tom put his suitcase.
I went to the zoo yesterday.
Don't you feel anything?
Tom is on the run.
Can we not talk about this just now?
I remember the day you were born very well.
"You miss Tom, don't you?"
Who started the fight?
School bores me.
It isn't much fun going mountain climbing by yourself.
He has something to do with the traffic accident.
Where is the Danish embassy?
I've had a headache for three days and I can't get rid of it.
I thought he wouldn't come.
I'm not sure right now.
He has a car that has four doors.
Do ghosts really exist?
What's your favorite dried fruit?
I never want to see your face again.
It was almost funny.
Tomorrow morning we're leaving Japan.
Who won the contest?
"This is going to be good for you, too."
I don't really like dogs all that much.
I like to study French.
Tom should've won.
I don't get it.
Why are you learning a foreign language?
Mary ran her perfectly manicured nails through her hair.
The unexpected always happens.
It doesn't look like Tom's around at the moment.
Are you one of Tom's students?
What did you want to see me about?
Tom knows what we did.
She has a few books.
His unique perspective helped shed light on the situation.
She could not keep her daughter from going out.
It will be over in a moment.
Not all of the museum's items are on display.
Tom is thirty years old.
My apartment is a mess.
"I now live in Boston in the US, but I plan to go back to Japan before the end of the year."
My computer crashed and now it won't start up.
It began to snow heavily as I got off the train.
Motivation is the key to success.
It is just five o'clock.
The tanker has a small crew.
They got into the boat.
"Tom saw a girl sitting all alone, so he went over to talk to her."
Does Tom really want me to leave?
Thanks for telling me the truth.
Tom said he didn't want to go to school today.
Sometimes I don't get you.
"Excuse me, which way is the post office?"
"You were looking, weren't you?"
Tom just kept eating.
"If you turn to the left, you'll see a white building."
"If Tom had money problems, I think he'd let us know."
Carrots are good for your eyes.
I took my shoes off.
Am I wrong?
This book is worthy of attention.
We enjoyed the party very much.
The orbit of Mars around the Sun is extremely elliptical.
What's today's plan?
Are you going to give up?
I miss my family.
The song was a big hit.
This river flows south into the sea.
This lawyer has never lost a case.
She always urges him to try new things.
You'd better not stay up too late.
Tom is worried about his future.
It was my fault.
I wondered why people were staring at me.
We know that and they know that.
That was the trouble.
I think that she knows the truth.
Women love that.
Do you need a break?
I want to want what you want.
She married a musician.
Tom and Mary announced the dissolution of their marriage.
Maybe it can be fixed.
I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.
"Tom and Mary were speaking in French, so I had no idea what they were talking about."
I want to be loved.
We were neighbors.
Tom isn't young.
The plan hasn't changed.
This is not the end of the world.
Children are not admitted.
You shouldn't have made such a remark even if you had been angry.
You don't have to hide your feelings.
Both his parents are dead.
Don't worry. I'll get home safely.
I wrapped myself in a towel.
My brother helped me with my homework.
Take the money and run.
A person is known by the company he keeps.
You ruined all my plans.
Tom seized Mary by the arm.
We have to take advantage of this situation.
"Tom and Mary shared an umbrella. However, it wasn't big enough and they both got wet."
I don't know which one to choose.
Isn't that obvious?
You are seriously ill.
"When I realized it was raining, I took my umbrella."
She is good-natured.
What you see above the water is just the tip of the iceberg.
I think it's time for me to show you how to do that properly.
We're going to freeze to death.
See to it that this never happens again.
We'd given up on you.
Tom looked pretty tired.
Tom wants to be friends with Mary.
Tom should've let his children come camping with us.
Look what I made for you.
I'm on the eighth floor.
Have you watched it?
Tom hadn't planned on going back to Australia so soon.
I am going to apply for a scholarship.
I'm so happy to meet you.
That red dress looks good on her.
Who invited you guys?
Tom isn't afraid of you.
"I gave one to Tom, too."
I have lost my wallet.
"Which do you like better, spring or autumn?"
When was the last time you saw Tom smile?
Father let me drive his car.
I don't feel well at such a high altitude.
Tom stood in front of the class and recited the poem.
Tom felt awkward.
Do you want us to take you home?
Tom was surprised and a little frightened.
The door wouldn't shut.
Tom couldn't have done anything to prevent the accident.
I will have to study tomorrow.
Tom had every right to be angry.
I'm flying to London for a business meeting this week.
I thought that went exceedingly well.
You can't go.
There were no alternatives.
This is Tom's bicycle.
I wish I had seen her.
He had a hungry look.
We're in the process of writing the report now.
Tom laughed at the misunderstanding.
These photographs remind me of our holiday.
Tom and Mary went for a walk along the beach.
I injured myself during PE class.
How much money do you have on you?
You have ten minutes to make up your mind.
I must be dreaming.
Tom certainly sounds like he's not planning to come.
"If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold."
What does Tom want to eat?
I'll try not to fall asleep.
Pasta is high in carbohydrates.
Am I welcome here?
I sometimes write to Tom.
Hoover withdrew American forces from Nicaragua.
People thought that she was dead.
I can't imagine doing that.
I'm a student.
I met my teacher on the street the other day.
I met him by chance at the airport yesterday.
I can't believe Tom killed Mary.
When did you go to London?
Tom was bullied by his classmates.
There's a nice Thai restaurant near here.
Tom doesn't know Mary's phone number.
"For here, or to go?"
Keep this in mind.
What a blessing it is that they did not come.
Face the music.
Send me a letter when you arrive.
The meeting ended at 4:00 p.m.
She finished her coffee and asked for another.
Tom did it just for fun.
We can't use this.
Tom got hit by a car.
Tom usually only wears glasses when he's reading.
I won't see her anymore.
I wonder why Tom did that.
I have a ringing in my ears.
Tom talked about school.
Why are you looking so sad?
I've written his address on the back of the envelope.
He claims to have visions from God.
Which hat do you want to buy?
Do you live alone?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
What surprised me was that Tom didn't know Mary.
We turned on the radio.
The rock rolled down the hillside.
I've always preferred working alone.
Tom asked Mary to come home.
It may occur at any moment.
You must stay with me.
I hope I didn't wake you.
Tom went to Boston to study music.
No one knows what's really going on.
What does that feel like?
This water tastes good.
You should smoke less.
"Are you happy now? ""Yes, I am."""
I was in danger of losing my life.
Tom isn't too happy.
I wish I could have spoken more English.
The party's over.
I fed the leftovers to my dog.
Tom has a ten-speed bicycle.
I think you spend too much time watching TV.
What do you do with these?
The man got away from the city.
I have never climbed Mt. Fuji.
This is a very strange letter.
Do you like tortellini?
Why didn't you say so earlier?
Tom wasn't the only one at the meeting that I knew.
You're a little overweight.
"If I could afford it, I would buy an electric car."
Tom is facing a few serious problems.
The company manufactures electrical goods.
I may be living in Australia next year.
Have you finished your work?
It looks good on paper.
I don't know if I can cope with it.
"As a last resort, read the instructions."
The old iron pipe was full of rust.
Tom is going to be OK.
Tom and Mary each took one cookie.
Tom probably got tired of waiting for Mary and left.
You will soon be convinced that I am right.
I decided I didn't want anything more to do with Tom.
He made a rude reply.
I almost caught the fish.
Tom was about to burst into tears.
Tom seems to be unwilling to compromise.
"Yesterday, I didn't say anything."
Did Tom come?
When can you start?
Will you tell him I called?
How many kilometers is it to the next town?
Tom needs protection.
The history of China is older than that of Japan.
He was unconscious of his guilt.
Keep Tom there.
Could you bring me a blanket?
The boat drifted down the stream.
What are you suggesting?
I danced all night long.
China is much larger than Japan.
Tom is doing fine in school.
My car is German.
He wants us to free the prisoners.
I can't translate this sentence.
Tom is on his way in.
Look around you.
Tom predicted our success.
Your house is beautiful.
My camera is the same as your camera.
The gardener was the murderer.
Tom reached into his coat pocket.
Tom's wish was granted.
I guess I was too busy to notice that Tom was having problems.
"In the summer, it dawns earlier than in the winter."
How long have you been away?
She's smart and beautiful.
There are many old Indian legends.
We must pay a toll to drive on this road.
Dogs have a keen sense of smell.
I don't think Tom liked the concert.
"Tom, what's wrong with you tonight?"
I excused myself for a minute.
Tom wasn't crazy.
He fell and broke his arm while he was skiing.
You'd better not speak.
Do you know where we live?
I see what you mean.
I feel perfectly fine.
The theater was jam-packed.
Thank you.
Silver doesn't cost as much as gold.
My mother's always yelling at me.
Tom asked Mary whether she'd like to go shopping.
I'm on my break.
Let's start over again.
She is looking for her car keys.
He did nothing but read newspapers.
I can't give it to you.
"You couldn't solve the problem, could you?"
Are you our enemy?
Boston is my home.
Tom works at a pizzeria.
"You know the way, don't you?"
All of a sudden they stopped talking.
"I'll take my passport with me, just in case."
I don't know what's going on here.
He cut down on drinking.
Please help yourself to the cookies.
Tom drowned in the ocean.
I think highly of him.
Nobody knows where he lives.
Tom hates climbing ladders.
Tom and I are old friends.
Tom wanted to know when it happened.
Show me the photo.
Those are Tom's.
Please don't die!
I am sorry if I disturbed you.
"I thought nothing could go wrong, but I was wrong."
He commanded me to shut the gate.
Can you please tell me how I can get to the beach?
I've removed the comma.
The box was empty when I opened it.
We caught two foxes.
Why did you buy another car?
This book is yours.
His hobby is painting pictures.
How do I open the hood?
Tom turned and ran after Mary.
We must run.
I could do that in my sleep.
We live in a big city.
Tom wondered why his wife left him.
I could get used to this.
I fell asleep in the middle of the lecture.
"He is not a friend, but an acquaintance."
Suit yourself.
We would have bought the plane tickets if the price had been a little lower.
Do you think I'm ugly?
She enjoyed conversing with him.
Tom spent the last years of his life in Boston.
No one can help you.
I ran into an old friend of mine at the party the other day.
Tom doesn't need to know where Mary is going.
The time will come when you will regret this.
The truth of the matter is dawning on him.
Tom works too much.

It's cheaper if you order these by the dozen.
Are you allergic to anything else?
Tom texted me.
The tower stood amid the ruins.
Tom handed Mary her bag.
I'm calling from Tom's.
They saw a strange animal there.
I would never hurt you.
Will you make room for me?
"If you're looking for a job, call me."
I'm good at soccer.
Would you please take my picture?
Tell Tom.
You have beautiful eyes.
Tom speaks French as well as me.
He recommended this dictionary to me.
Do you get paid for this?
Cut off the power.
She suddenly lost consciousness.
Is that what you think of me?
Tom has three cousins.
The picture is hung crooked.
Mary got mad at me.
Even Tom grinned.
I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.
I'll get her to come here.
I learned to read in school.
All of you look healthy.
"I don't understand this ""I don't understand it either."""
Why did you do that?
I heard him sing a song.
I've asked Tom to stop doing that.
Tom is a confirmed bachelor.
Are you a student here?
There's a black sheep in every flock.
My father asked me to open the door.
I don't think you're heartless.
He never speaks English without making mistakes.
I have no time to waste.
I'm not too happy about that.
Tom noticed the wedding ring on Mary's finger.
Some companies guarantee their workers a job for life.
Tom is Mary's son.
I can't listen to this anymore.
Is breakfast ready?
That's not how it is.
The papers that were in the safe are gone.
Who invented the telephone?
Tell us how we may help you.
Tom gave Mary a quick kiss and walked out the door.
I want you to have fun.
Do you see what I'm getting at?
The plane is about to take off.
Where's this from?
Tom broke out of jail.
Tom may have taken my umbrella by mistake.
We've done everything possible.
Tom was dressed in black and wore a black ski mask.
I need a new pair of shoes.
How will you stop them?
How long have you known?
He's getting old.
Tom's car has air conditioning.
Few people live to be ninety years old.
I promised him to keep it secret.
It's none of your business.
Do you want to leave with Tom?
She married a rich man.
Those earphones don't work.
We chose Tom as captain.
You are absolutely right.
She cleared away the dishes from the table.
Why are you sleeping?
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
He wore old shoes.
I study English after dinner.
Tom taught me a lot of things.
That's your job.
I'll answer you tomorrow.
Do the children go to school?
Is that all you've got to say?
Look out of the window.
Tom is an old and trusted friend.
I'm going fishing with him.
Whose letter is this?
Many children had to look after themselves.
Tom got used to ignoring the noise.
The doctor insisted that he stay in bed.
We accept all major credit cards.
Tom was wearing jeans.
I love practical jokes.
She plays tennis after school.
Tom doesn't know.

Be quiet while I am speaking.
They aren't related.
Do you live here?
I often help my sister do her homework.
Tom should leave now.
"Had they known what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans."
I've got to talk to Tom.
There was only a little milk left in the bottle.
He added that he didn't believe it.
Tom got back into his car.
Tom is good with kids.
The ground was very uneven.
Tom may die.
I'd like to meet Tom as soon as possible.
Tom likes money.
The policeman suspected the man was guilty.
It's to your advantage to learn everything you can.
What are you afraid of?
I'm sure you have other skills.
I hurt my eye when my contact slipped out of place.
There are many modern buildings around here.
I've just gotten home.
He doesn't do stupid things like that.
We pitched the tent next to the river.
Did you see anybody there?
There used to be a big cherry tree behind my house.
"Although each person follows a different path, our destinations are the same."
Tom often wears a hat.
I'd like to come along if you don't mind.
I thought about all the stories my father had told me.
Who wrote the book?
Aren't you Tom's brother?
I can't tell you any more than that.
I want to be young again.
Why is Tom here anyway?
I won't stand for it.
Will you open the window and air out this stuffy room?
"All things considered, he is a good teacher."
Someone will do that job.
Who is that man?
You won.
I dream in French.
"She's a girl, but she's brave."
If only he had known!
Tom got in the boat.
Show me how it works.
I need a dictionary.
Your instincts were correct.
You should apologize to Tom for being late.
He plays the piano better than I do.
Something's not right here.
He's an early bird.
Who can you trust?
When do the fireworks start?
She wouldn't allow me to read the letter.
"That's interesting, but beside the point."
"Does she have a dog? ""No, she doesn't."""
I'd like to ask you something.
Tom said that he wanted to be left alone.
"I was born in Boston, but I was brought up in Chicago."
Who hired you?
Would you date a man thirty years older than you?
Do you remember where we first met each other?
"You're not a Canadian, are you?"
She has a nice figure.
You survived.
The highway was blocked.
We set a trap to catch a fox.
Tom was carried away by the police.
He has a nose bleed.
Let me get right to the point.
There's a lot we don't know.
Tom hardly ever makes mistakes.
Is that boy Tom?
Send the bill to my house.
Tom drove fast.
It's already eleven.
We don't know what Tom knows.
I was a chubby kid.
I already told Tom.
Tom works with his hands.
They sell sugar at the store.
"I'm really bad with names, but I never forget a face."
Did you watch the soccer game on television?
These cars are made in Japan.
I didn't ask Tom to wait for me.
The train leaves at 2:30 p.m.
You'll need to do that sooner or later.
She caught a cold last night.
He's in the joint.
I can't tell if you're being honest or not.
It's obvious that you are an intelligent boy.
I think Tom is kind.
This is the worst hotel in town.
What would you change?
"This is yours, isn't it?"
I've had a lousy day.
"I have to stop you from doing that. ""Stop me from doing what?"""
Tom has gained a lot of weight recently.
I've been here for three hours.
He was whistling a tune.
He came home very late.
You'd better not go there.
You can wait for me here.
Do you know the reason?
You were always such a happy boy.
I missed my flight.
Who's going to take care of my dog while I'm gone?
The boy is tall for his age.
I woke up at sunrise.
My mother's feeling better.
There's going to be a downpour.
Tom doesn't think that Mary was the one who did that.
You can't stay here.
Do you want me to leave?
Tom knew Mary didn't know French.
I tried hard.
Don't be so sure.
Tom can't say for sure where Mary lives.
I think that Tom and Mary aren't biased.
I don't buy a lot of candy.
Love is blind.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
His death was made known to the public.
Are you afraid of the dark?
I cried.
How is your family?
I do my own taxes.
Tom looked through the menu.
"We could have our tea in the garden, were it a little warmer."
One must do one's best in everything.
Why don't you ever say it?
What does Tom want to say to Mary?
How did you become a police officer?
They really did it.
You need to have give-and-take in your relationship.
Tom and his wife both have to work to make ends meet.
I'm perfectly happy.
Someone tried to kill me.
You're after me.
I can't imagine a day without you.
Money can't buy happiness.
Tom sent Mary a message.
"Tom, what do you think?"
Don't give me that!
I was foolish enough to believe him.
I'm going to Tom's house.
Are those bedbugs?
She has psychic abilities.
Don't run so fast.
Your bag is on my desk.
What did you do exactly?
That's no way to treat a guest.
Where's the nearest doctor?
I regret not having bought that house.
That doesn't mean I can stay.
Tom opened the refrigerator.
Why are you mad at Tom?
Maybe I should write a letter to Tom.
Do whatever makes you happy.
He accepts gifts from students.
I need you to drive me to the station.
The mere sight of the doctor made my cousin afraid.
Did he get married when he was in Germany?
You need to eat less and exercise more.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
Do you want a glass of water?
There must be a logical explanation for this.
You're fair.
I don't want to open the window.
It's more fun to play baseball than to watch it.
Do you have enough time to do that?
Tom has found a new job.
Tom was appalled.
Tom didn't think it was right.
The common language of many Asians is English.
Tom is saving up money so he can go to Australia.
Tom speaks French like a native.
Why did you decide to speak about that now?
When are you going to come home?
It's very big.
You have to hurry.
Do you think Tom really did this without any help?
This custom should be done away with.
You remind me of your brother.
You have to be prepared for anything.
Tom put a lot of honey on his toast.
I don't intend to answer any questions.
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
You've chosen a good time to visit Boston.
Don't bother me with such foolish questions.
I'd like to offer you a job.
We all have missed you.
How did you get Tom to do that for you?
He had an accident on his way home.
Tom put one strawberry on each cupcake.

Be careful with him. He's a Don Juan.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Be very careful with that blue box.
Water freezes at 0 degrees Centigrade.
Tom took off his coat and hung it on the hook behind the door.
"Tom, could I have a word with you?"
"You can still swim quite well, can't you?"
The mailman left a note on our door.
Which cat is yours?
I hope that Tom and Mary get here soon.
Tom currently doesn't have a job.
He is asleep.
Tom tried to thwart Mary's plans.
Put the car into the garage.
He often gets angry at small things.
Tom tiptoed into the bedroom to avoid waking up his wife.
Do you want to leave it like that?
Never lose hope.
The pencil I lost yesterday was an old one.
The boy has an apple in his pocket.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Did you meet her?
Tom can't decide.
Tom turned white.
We have received many orders from the U.S.
Tom told me he was going to clean up his room.
I'm fed up with his long talks.
Could you please be quiet?
I bought this book as a gift for Tom.
I'll remember that.
Tom appears satisfied.
Tom had changed so much that I didn't even recognize him.
"If I were you, I would ignore it."
You're gullible.
The door was ajar.
What's the ambassador's name?
May I introduce myself to you?
The room was so full of smoke that I could hardly breathe.
"Speech is silver, but silence is golden."
The people knew he did not like them.
No alcohol is allowed on campus.
The boat sunk and everyone died.
Tom and Mary were about to sit down for dinner when John knocked on the door.
Tom says he can't put up with the heat any longer.
Tom was hungry.
Do you see my point?
Do you want to resign?
"Whose sheep are these? ""They are mine."""
"Relax, you're doing fine."
I recognized him at once.
It's none of our business.
It is hard for the couple to live together any longer.
Tom's mom caught the flu.
Tom and I are fine.
The restaurant owner allowed her to take table scraps home to feed all of her dogs.
It was yesterday that she went.
Tom let the cat out of the bag.
His mother picked him up.
Tom never works on Sunday.
You can't skateboard here.
I don't want to burden you with my troubles.
What kind of historian are you?
That castle was built in ancient times.
Is the job too much for you?
Mary smoothed down her skirt.
"You have no idea, do you?"
I beg you to help me.
You can use the hotel's swimming pool.
This drink is on the house.
"The hunter aimed at the bird, but missed."
It seemed that she had already received the money.
We learned at school that the square root of nine is three.
I was beginning to have my doubts.
How could I help it?
Let's get some sleep.
I'll be alone.
Tom vanished without a trace.
Tom is kind of tired. He wants to go home.
How long have you waited?
Please make sure that the dog doesn't go outside.
Tom closed his eyes and listened to the music.
He was lying on his back on the beach.
Is this yours?
That just goes to prove that you are a liar.
There are a good many reasons why you shouldn't do it.
We only have one more left.
Tom ate a TV dinner.
"What time is it? ""It's 3:20."""
They will return.
They announced an increase in tuition fees.
Did you consider other alternatives?
He is a type of a person who calls a spade a spade.
That's Tom's decision.
It occurred to me that I should not keep it secret.
You'd better go home.
Mary took out the eggs one by one.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I need three volunteers.
The train seems to be late.
You haven't tried hard enough.
I could show you around the city.
That must be what love looks like.
Tom can be pig-headed and stubborn at times.
She should be there now because she left an hour ago.
Tom stopped playing the piano as soon as we walked into the room.
I wish you would reconsider.
I'll have to reconsider it.
Where's your money?
I'd like to try some Thai food.
Tom opened the windows to air out the room.
This table is just as large as ours.
"After you kill the sheep, you'll have to skin it."
"After taking a shower, Tom ate dinner."
"He said that if he were there, he would help her."
"You aren't leaving Japan for good, are you?"
He is wearing gloves.

Tom is his own worst enemy.
How did it happen?
Promise me you won't tell Mom.
Do I need to change my diet?
It's to the point.
I'm learning to play the clarinet.
Tom shuffled out.
I just need five minutes.
I bet you're wondering why Tom left so early.

Stop hitting Tom.
She fell asleep.
She wrote one letter.
He played the guitar and she played the piano.
Everything depends on what you will do.
It's only four minutes from here by train.
None of us are cowards.
Those were his actual words.
He stuck to his promise.
No one knows his name.
It's expensive though.
It's all Greek to me.
Her face resembles her mother's.
This country has a mild climate.
It is ten minutes before eleven.
I was not pleased.
I don't have to listen to this.
I was too tired to go on.
I love broccoli.
They probably don't know.
He loves to make a mountain out of a molehill.
I answered the door.
That's enough for today.

How do parents do it?
He wrote on the social evolution of Japan.
Did you advise the suspect of his rights?
It's clear that he stole money from the safe.
I always enjoy listening to classical music in my free time.
I wish I could figure out how to make more money.
Tom doesn't allow his son to eat ice cream.
Didn't you just repair that three days ago?
My father likes pizza very much.
Tom is shirtless.
She ignored him until he became rich.
It cannot be true.
I'd like to see Tom.
I thought you said you worked here.
We caught some large fish there.
He talks too fast.
Not everything can be bought with money.
I really don't want to clean my room.
I've lived in Boston.
I like to take a shower at night.
That's my fault.
Tom wondered if he should pretend to appreciate the dinner Mary made for him.
I wonder whether or not Tom will be here tomorrow.
Tell me what to do.
Tom hired Mary as an interpreter.
I don't know if I still have it.
I had to attend a meeting so I couldn't make it in time to pick Tom up after school.
Have you told your parents?
Would you mind telling me where you're going?
You should quit smoking.
Do you have a fishing license?
Don't give in to peer pressure.
I don't have those answers.
I guess that she is 40.
Do you see this?
Tom asked Mary if she knew how to play that song on the flute.
I'll get rid of them.
Tom doesn't think it's his fault.
"How do you say ""hello"" in French?"
Why didn't you tell me that?
I want to hear what you have to say.
I don't want to call the police.
Tom drinks beer every day.
The bed takes up a lot of room.
Everything here is mine.
Am I fat?
I don't know why it happened.
Tom's last name isn't easy to pronounce.
I'm taking off now.
That's not fair.
Tom filled his glass and then filled one for Mary.
What's up with you today?
I'm not interested in this.
You should be ashamed.
I'm your partner.
His story must be true.
I want to close my account.
There were a number of students in the room.
Keep this information under your hat.
Do you think Tom is right?
"Tom explained it in detail, but I still don't understand it."
I'm going to take that as a yes.
The cut will heal up in a few days.
I could never do that sort of thing.
Tom has some very good news.
Tom whistled a tune as he walked along the river.
She has no sense of duty.
He declined to comment.
I hope I'm not imposing.
This one's for me.
I really like that girl.
It wasn't Tom who kissed Mary.
The other one doesn't work.

Why do people say that?

Tom should hear about this.
They set the time and place of the wedding.

It's worse than that.
Aren't you curious?
You aren't supposed to swim here.
Tom is a little taller than me.

Air quality has deteriorated these past few years.
I see how you study.
I want vengeance.
I used to read detective stories before going to bed.
"Can you iron this T-shirt for me, please?"
May I go to bed?
None of us are against his idea.
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
She didn't show up at the party yesterday.
We don't know how to use it.
He was constantly bullied at school.
I'll miss you very much if you go.
Tom never stopped.
You're on the wrong road.
It's not at all easy.
There's still time.
We used to visit my grandparents every weekend when I was a kid.
Why are you so sure Tom told Mary about what happened?
I couldn't anticipate that that would happen.
She says she brushes her teeth every morning.
Why don't you want to go to school?
Tom thinks Mary is really stuck up.
I might be wrong.
Thank you for the time you spent with me during my visit to Atlanta.
Is the boss there?
What he says makes no sense at all.
We'll never know.
I was wounded by her comments.
Tell me something new.
I don't know who to choose.
We also went to the temple.
You completely missed my point.
There is an apple on the table.
Are you still playing golf?
Please send this by special delivery.
I wish you would stop doubting me.
You look ravishing in that dress.
I never wanted to hurt you.
He's definitely not coming.
Most people in the village objected to the plan.
Keep Tom inside.
I have to write a letter. Do you have some paper?
It would be a mistake not to do what Tom asked you to do.
The computer repair took all day.
I would like to go to sleep now.
I want you to do this.
Baby lions are cute.
Tom isn't wearing socks.
I'm beginning to believe that we'll never be able to convince Tom that he's wrong.
"As I told you earlier, I can't help you."
I can see smoke.
Tom said he had a stomachache and left the room.
Tom has bushy eyebrows.
She has lost all hope.
The neighbors will call the police if you don't turn the music down.
You're acting like a spoiled brat.
She blackmailed him.
"You're very rich, aren't you?"
She knows everything about cooking.
That way I kill two birds with one stone.
Find an empty bottle and fill it with water.
She is certain to be surprised.
This is nothing.
That was a funny joke.
Tom and Mary were the only ones who were saved.
Don't worry. Everything's OK.
"Can you come over this afternoon? ""Yes, I suppose I could."""
"To make a long story short, he was fired."
Just throw them away.
We spent our holiday on a beach in Hawaii.
Everyone felt sorry for Tom.
Can't you go to Boston with Tom?
The red belt makes her black dress look even better.
You should know that's impossible.
I love movies.
Tom only wears a suit on special occasions.
"The instant he opened the door, he smelt something burning."
You didn't say the magic word.
Tom did nothing but watch TV all day.
Those are Tom's.
Whose handwriting is this?
She carried that table by herself.
I assure you that's not the case.
This is the house in which he was born.
How long have you been watching us?
This is what I've been looking for.
He loved her very much.
Are you fit?
"On my way to school each day, I generally see many dogs and cats."
Tell me how to spell the word.
Have you ever taken a lie detector test?
"If UFOs were to attack the earth, what would become of us?"
I did my best to prevent this.
He is not a smoker.
Have you sent him a Christmas card yet?
I don't know what to do anymore.
It's way too cold to swim.
Who else is going to be at the party?
I did so for the sake of my health.
The decision was in favor of the defendant.
All plants need water and light.
He used to work as a stuntman.
You'd better go.
The silence in the library was disturbed by the ringing of a cell phone.
Where is my dad?
The dog bit my hand.
I live a simple life.
Tom isn't very good at this.
She pulled down the blinds.
I don't know how to do it.
We're going to go.
Tom seems anxious.
Tom found Mary's diary.
That's weird.
How can you be so optimistic about the future?
He has been driving for hours.
Tom is too old for you.
The Indians had difficulty finding food.
It could be just a coincidence.
Why were you in that neighborhood?
He gave the child a toy.
Tell me about your plan.
Her manners are not those of a lady.
There is no one here with that name.
Those colors go well together.
Tom jumped.
Tom didn't scream.
So what are you implying?
Take this medicine twice a day.
My father retired at the age of 65.
Why didn't you tell us you knew how to speak French?
She cooks very well.
"If you need money, I'll lend you some."
Tom's choking.
Suit yourself.
It was a long letter.
I would never kiss Tom.
I appreciate your telling me.
Tom gave up all hope.
We'll get it this time.
I know all the details.
There is not one person who is in agreement with the plan.
Tom got impatient.
Tom will be back on his feet soon.
Tom and I are very close.
Have they connected the radio antenna?
Tom earns a good salary.
Does your watch keep good time?
Don't worry. It's not the end of the world.
She listens to him.
Tom looked at the message.
I thought that you said you were bad at French.
I won't return.
Tom adores you.
I don't think that would be a good idea.
He was young and innocent.
It is easy to answer the question.
I have no problem with this.
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea?
Tom is good at solving problems.
"When Tom looked at his watch, he was surprised to see how late it was."
I can't stretch my right arm.
I guess I should've done more.
I recommend Maui.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Don't you see me?
What a big dog!
I felt exhausted when the game was over.
Lend me your car tomorrow.
Would you be willing to help?
"At the end of the class, the teacher said, ""That's enough for today."""
Tom walked to the gate.
"It took us a long time, but finally we were able to find it."
Let's finish this work as soon as possible.
"When I got up this morning, it was raining."
I persuaded him to take part in it.
Do you know how many people died in yesterday's plane crash?
Tom has a potbelly.
My sister is three years older than I am.
Please call before you come.
She needs to be more careful.
"Even though Tom has a very demanding job, he always makes time for Mary and the kids."
Which shall I begin with?
I rolled the dough to make some cookies.
Let's sing and dance.
Call them this evening.
You are probably wrong.
She took something out of the bag.
We drove to Hakone last Sunday.
Shall we start?
Are you going to visit any other countries?
Tom has gone home early.
Would you like to sing?
You're looking good!
Let's eat our food before it gets cold.
"Lucky at cards, unlucky in love."
"Each time you step on the pedal, the wheel turns once."
Tom managed to get some sleep on the plane.
Tom wanted to impress his girlfriend.
"In spite of the heavy traffic, we arrived on time."
She shouldn't go by herself.
Tom doesn't have a wife.
I have to finish packing.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
I'm not in favor of this plan.
The birds flew away in all directions.
You'll want for nothing while I am alive.
Tom said he never saw Mary.
Count to thirty.
Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?
I can't just walk away.
Tom wanted to set the record straight.
Tom stopped rowing.
Why don't you go alone?
Tom is still alive.
Do you think that eating breakfast every day is important?
I'm going to write Tom a letter.
Tom is lucky he has so many friends.
"I thought if I broke up with you, I'd never have to see you again."
Tom raised the flag.
I should've phoned Tom before I went over to see him.
She suffocated him with a pillow.
You've got to go home.
Do you know Tom's blood type?
Let's go find a place that serves Buffalo wings.
Take Tom out of here.
Why do you like Tom?
I told you Tom was busy.
I almost never listen to the radio.
Give us a break.
It took Tom 10 years to finish his house.
The girl is skillful at knitting.
How can you be so optimistic about the future?
Tom didn't let Mary in.
I'd like to know your opinion.
I thought maybe you could tell me what I need to know.
The countryside is beautiful in the spring.
The baseball game was called off because of rain.
He wrapped his arms around me.
Why didn't you just ask someone for directions?
You're going to need your umbrella.
Tom is reading a novel by Sidney Sheldon now.
I can't remember exactly how old I was when I first met Tom.
I don't like to run.
I worry about the kids.
Tom's dying.
Tom never worried about how much things cost.
I sensed immediately that something was wrong.
I expect him to come at any moment.
What can you give me?
Have you noticed anything suspicious?
I can't do this.
She has a gigantic appetite.
"If you don't do that, I won't either."
He is an experienced teacher.
"If you come across an unfamiliar word, look it up in your dictionary."
What were you doing out here?
He has eyes at the back of his head.
Did you hear the bell?
I've lost.
"If you don't want to do this, you don't have to."
Let's meet at one o'clock.
Tom is probably at the gym.
Can you open it?
Tom had a chance to travel to Boston.
It seems like we have to go now.
Tom realized something was very wrong.
I don't know what to do here.
Is the hotel close to the airport?
She blushed.
Why did you want to talk to Tom?
Tom felt foolish.
Did I miss something this morning?
I miss my mom's cooking.
All you have to do is sit here and be quiet.
You had better hurry because the banks will close soon.
My neck does hurt a little.
Did you enjoy the film?
How did your interview go?
I'm not a good liar.
What do you believe in?
Tom and Mary can't stand each other.
You should plan to leave between 6:00 and 7:00.
He has a special regard for her.
I'm not going to make it.
A big crowd gathered at the scene of the fire.
Why don't you drop in?
He's living from hand to mouth.

You're very timid.
It is essential for you to practice every day.

"This one's my room, Tom."
My flight arrived at 2:30 p.m.
Where are we?
The magician made birds appear and disappear.
I should talk to Tom.
Don't waste too much time.

I doubt if he will come on time.
These are decisions I want to make alone.
Tom has been here for quite a long time.
He often goes to Japan on business.
"By evening, a few clouds had formed."
Mary is a stubborn woman.
I'll sing.
Tom was annoying.
He belongs to the soccer club.
People came to like her paintings.
Tom put the book aside.
He is less impatient than his father.
Tom is going to do that for me.
Don't call me anymore.
"Take this medicine, and you'll feel better."
My salary doesn't allow us to live extravagantly.
I want you out of here.
We got a flat tire.
The bicycle is mine.
Don't bother getting up.
I'm in love with you.
The clock has just struck three.
Are you sure there's nothing else we have to do?
Tom came out of his hiding place.
No one gave up hope.
I only believe about half of what Tom says.
It was stupid of him to turn down her offer.
I think Tom doesn't like it here.
Please give me something to eat.
I've enjoyed working with you.
You're disgusting!
Can we count on you?
The document passed into the enemy's hands.
How do you spell that word?
"Sorry, but I don't understand."
I'm dead set against the plan.
You look hot.
I still think that Tom will win.
I'm proud of my father being a good cook.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
You should come back here again.
You're wasteful.
Tom realized that he might be in danger.
That has nothing to do with you.
Your suggestion is of no practical use.
Tom is a microbiologist.
Where are we right now?
I didn't mean to yell.
Tom winked at Mary.
He brought me to the bus stop.
It's not a big deal.
Tom isn't my patient.
There's something I forgot to tell you.
I can't predict what'll happen.
We spent three hours in the open air.
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me!
Tom's French is quite good.
Tom surrendered.
"Tom speaks French, doesn't he?"
"I can hear you, but I can't see you."
I like to read the news.
I'm glad I don't need that.
All that you have to do is to follow his advice.
Don't you want to hear the rest?
He failed in spite of his great efforts.
I especially liked the way you sang the second song.
I would like to have a room of my own.
Who's volunteering?
Did you eat breakfast today?
She pushed him out the door.
Get down!
I'll never forget the day when we first met.
Tom made me swear not to tell Mary.
I managed to make the teacher understand my idea.
I can't eat this kind of food.
Tom stood quietly.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I can't remember how long it took.
Your office is nicer than mine.
Do not talk with your mouth full.
"I returned the books I borrowed from the library, and I borrowed some new ones."
I see you're doing very well in your business.
Your jokes aren't funny.
"I used to ride my bike to school, but now I take the bus."
Tom has a friend whose father is an astronaut.
Tom went on a camping trip with a friend.
Are those the people you saw yesterday?
That's what I thought.
I am studying Chinese and Spanish.
"If I were you, I'd follow his advice."
You must never forget that.
I have just now finished doing my English homework.
She screamed when she saw the snake.
You can't both be right.
He severely criticized the mayor.
Tom has already filed a complaint.
What happens next?
Whether or not Tom gets the job in Boston is still very much up in the air.
Tom was the only one drunk at the party.
I went on sleeping because the alarm didn't go off.
All of the buses are full.
Would you mind if I wait until Tom gets back?
Four more are needed to make fifty.
I can speak a little French.
This word has three syllables.
I went on a ten-day trip to Easter Island.
I knew both Tom and Mary very well.
Why did you have to embarrass me in front of the others?
I don't want to be rich. I just don't want to be poor.
Crime does not pay.
Tom boiled the potatoes.
Tom is very impatient.
You've been really helpful.
My bike was stolen yesterday.
Pandas spend at least 12 hours each day eating bamboo.
Tom is a biochemist.
I don't quite believe it when I hear someone claim they can speak more than five languages fluently.
My dream is to make it as an actor in Hollywood.
Tom loves skiing.
Are they coming here tomorrow?
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
My parents got divorced.
He owns a good few sheep.
Just what exactly are you trying to say?
She forgot to mail the letter.
Doesn't Tom like girls?
I am concerned for her safety.
"If you don't want to do it for Tom, then do it for me."
This highway saves us a lot of time.
Which room do you want me to clean first?
Have you changed anything?
Both Tom and I don't understand French at all.
It is already eleven.
Tom likes to avoid large crowds.
Do you still drink your coffee black?
I'm going to miss you.
Shut the door.
I'm going to Japan with my girlfriend in August.
Do you remember the first time we went to Boston together?
You've got a vivid imagination!
I'm suffering from a bad headache.
I understand you had a little talk with Tom.
Tom taught me how to swim.
Look! There's a plane taking off.
He never touches alcoholic drinks.
I have a slow Internet connection.
Some people were late.
It's just started raining.
I don't like those shoes.
We have to take the risk.
Tom talks tough.
The students seem bored.
"Tom isn't supposed to smoke at work, but he does."
There's a monster under my bed.
I love garlic.
All we need is a little more time.
You may still do it if you want to.
How about going to a movie?
Tom goes to a school for the blind.
She is very bright.
I did nothing illegal.
I'm really tired and want to go to bed early.
The students burned their textbooks.
There is a public telephone on that corner.
She finished ironing the clothes a few minutes ago.
That doesn't belong to us.
"Cold this morning, isn't it?"
I can neither confirm nor deny this.
Have you ever thought about donating your organs after you die?
"Please speak slowly, so I can understand you."
Tom isn't likely to agree with Mary's suggestion.
This car must have had tough usage.
Don't resist us.
It was only a joke.
She lived there for years.
You're not Tom's type.
I work in Boston.
We danced all night long.
Have you ever been a witness in a court case?
I didn't have to say it twice.
He emptied his pockets of their contents.
We're getting a new car next month.
You should try to live within your income.
"To make a long story short, we married."
Buy whatever you need.
He looked at me in surprise.
I went to Kyushu by airplane.
Tom was sure that he would never see her again.
Some stores discount the price.
"If he's busy, help him."
Even Tom looked annoyed.
"At last, my wish has come true."
Tom must've left it around here somewhere.
All-purpose flour can be used in a variety of recipes.
Tom explained the problem to Mary.
Don't help me. I want to do this by myself.
"Wait, it could be dangerous."
It's possible Tom and Mary are related.
Your feet are dirty.
"How are you doing? ""I can't complain."""
The squirrel climbed the tree.
It's going to take at least an hour to get there.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
You have no idea how much time I've spent on this project.
Tom has a pain in the shoulder.
The moon has no atmosphere.
Could you pass me the salt?
Don't ever touch me again.
She was wearing long boots.
How do you spend your free time?
He's always breaking into our conversation.
I hear you were in Boston recently.
What they told you is not true.
Tom stared dejectedly out the window.
You don't need to come into the office tomorrow.
I am interested in American literature.
Tom is the real hero.
You should try some of this pie.
The beauty of the sunrise was beyond description.
It's our pleasure.
Tom's feet are really big.
I just did what anybody would've done.
Tom had no options left.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.
I guess you are right.
What are you cooking?
Tom kissed Mary goodbye at the gate.
"He struck a match, but quickly put it out."
Please give me the details of the accident.
The special effects are excellent.
I won't be able to help you.
I want you to go to Osaka at once.
"It's a matter of when, not if."
Tom said that I had to study French.
Get that stupid look off your face.
I don't want my mother to worry.
You are expecting too much of her.
Are you going to help us or not?
Keep it quiet.
This door won't open.
Is there a telephone here?
You should go in there.
You'll regret having said those words.
Let's see if I can convince Tom to do the job.
I just want to get some sleep.
Why don't you buy a car?
I'm suffering from a bad headache.
Tom was winning.
Forget him.
You're not supposed to have this key.
Tom rubbed his palms together.
He found a public telephone and called a taxi.
There is a bottle of wine on the table.
We refer to this city as Little Kyoto.
There's nothing more I can do.
Tom fell out of love with Mary.
Tom never listens to what the teacher says.
It isn't what I thought.
I like both.
Did you eat your spinach?
No one cares about that anymore.
Stop crying.
Are you willing to drive me to the station?
I want to be an astronaut.
Tom spent a lot of time reading books when he was in the hospital.
You should take a vacation.
I didn't think it mattered.
I'm glad that you asked Tom for advice.
Nothing really stands out.
Do you have some money?
What does she think about my car?
"When you compare this dictionary with that one, you can easily see which is better."
This medicine will soothe your headache.
Let's sit outside.
The river flowed over its banks.
Tom is athletic.
Tom forgot to turn off the microphone when he turned to say something to Mary.
Tom is too good for you.
"He bought pencils, notebooks, dictionaries and so on."
I hated history class.
I didn't study at all.
You'll never guess what I found.
Tom and I were up all night talking.
Say hello to Tom.
Tom can't tell the difference between cheap and expensive wine.
You've got a lot of work ahead of you.
What did you do to get expelled from school?
Isn't Tom handsome?
Everyone needs a place to call home.
Not every untrue statement is a lie.
I'm going to get you something really great for your birthday.
He's now studying.
I have low blood pressure.
The climate here is milder than that of Moscow.
Tom likes fried chicken.
They were soldiers.
It's beyond my comprehension.
How many people came to your party?
The British commander ordered his men to rest for the night.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom liked the idea until I told him it was Mary's idea.
You should've told me Tom wasn't planning to go with us.
Tom says he saw someone climbing over the fence.
You may go home now if you like.
"By the way, what's your address?"
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
I was at the party.
He has ten cows.
Are you willing to take a cut in pay?
Kiss Tom.
Don't ever talk to me again.
It isn't here anymore.
I haven't bought a new coat in five years.
Tom hurt me.
I think I'm going crazy.
Is the phone ringing?
I hope I haven't misspelled your name.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
How do you think Tom will cope with the situation?
I'm happy you're here.
He locked himself in the bathroom.
Call your next witness.
"Unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to leave his native town."
I've lost my strength.
Tom was smoking.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
The students who are occupying the administration building have threatened to kill themselves.
What do I owe you?
"Yes, I know."
He went blind from the accident.
I believed every word he said.
We have run out of gas.
I'd like to look at that graph.
What do your parents do for a living?
"If you change your mind, let us know."
I'll be back at half past six.
Don't wait for me.
Do you know why Tom is absent from school?
Have you lost weight?
I guess asking Tom to help is out of the question.
I like my coffee strong.
You saved my hide.
We played together every day when we were kids.
I have a daughter that goes to school with Tom.
They fought the fire.
Tom isn't like the other boys.
"Tom, please restrain yourself."
Tom must've known that would happen.
He is in Tokyo.
I'd like you to handle it.
"The more one has, the more one wants."
"If I had known your telephone number, I would have called you."
I hate it when this happens.
The company has sent several representatives to discuss the matter.
Am I boring you?
Tom wanted to say goodbye.
I think it won't be a problem.
I need someone to protect me.
This window won't open. See if you can get it to move.
I'll leave this work to you.
Tom told us about his trip.
I bake two or three loaves of bread every week.
Tom wanted to live in Boston.
The soup is a bit too salty.
We're not from around here.
What's missing?
Make the new guy do it.
Tom explained in detail what he had seen.
I didn't believe Tom at first.
Did you know my father?
Mary was desperate to get married.
Cook for me.
Do you remember my name?
My father's birthday falls on Sunday this year.
We're trapped!
He asked me where she lived.
He is the stingiest person I know.
He was too tired to walk any further.
Don't pretend you don't know what I'm talking about.
Do you think Tom will actually help us?
He put his money in the bag.
I can't risk it.
Tom is pathetic.
She spoke through an interpreter.
How many pens do you have?
Are you going to tell Tom what I did?
Just follow them.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Don't you like baseball?
I didn't know he had a weak heart.
Please let us know.
What did you say? I can't hear you.
"You could be right, I suppose."
"Could you spell your name, please?"
I don't understand German.
It seems that the rainy season has set in.
Tom didn't move an inch.
The bouncer wouldn't let him in.
Tom can't deny it anymore.
He has a large truck.
Are you happy with how you look?
She was surprised when she heard the news.
Thank you for waking me up.
"Before long, the ghost disappeared into a thick fog."
Can I change the channel?
Mary is the best-looking woman I know.
I got out of the taxi.
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
It is essential that we find it.
You're my friend.
"If I have any others questions, may I call you?"
I just finished reading the book.
You came too late.
How many volunteers did you get?
No one knows who's in charge here.
Tom didn't really do a very good job.
What do you have in your bag?
Did you enjoy that?
How many cameras do you have?

I thought that was the case.
That's OK.
What's the difference between a hedgehog and a porcupine?
I have to stop this.
My neck still hurts.
I have to lose weight.
I'm going with Tom.

A pound is a unit of weight.
We can't do this without Tom.

"Tom is better prepared this time, so he should be able to do it."
All humanity will suffer if a nuclear war breaks out.

She is a twin.
How long can I keep this book?
The dictionary on the desk is Tom's.
Who painted this beautiful picture?
A new topic came up in conversation.
Tom mowed Mary's lawn.
I'm not happy here.
I'll listen to you.
Can you see anything out there?
"He was to have called her up, but he forgot."
Do you want this job?
I felt hungry.
"So, what do you find so interesting about dinosaurs?"
Why didn't someone help Tom?
They called him a traitor.
"Instead of eating here, let's go home."
Tom and Mary are expecting you.
They assisted him in performing the operation.
Tom came close.
Are you going to tell Tom?
I'm getting ready for the worst.
Are you a ghost?
She had no other choice but to marry the old man.
I'm not over it.
Why don't you try this jacket on? It looks nice with your trousers.
You'd have to ask Tom.
Tom is my older brother.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
I can't say anything at this time.
What does Tom look like?
Who told you I would help you?
We lost the game.
You guys have to hurry.
Does Tom know Mary?
Won't you stay for tea?
What happened to you? You look miserable.
Tom made me come down here.
Do you have many hobbies?
Do you live with your parents?
He used his umbrella as a weapon.
We admired the beauty of the scenery.
This mission entails huge risks.
Tom hasn't arrived yet.
I think you're lying.
It won't come to that.
The concert was a big disappointment.
Do I look presentable?
How are things going?
Can you stay a bit longer?
Write with a pen.
That's not bad.
That's all going to change.
"This isn't going to work, you know."
I'm the one who killed Tom.
I'm doing this for them.
Does it often snow in the winter here?
Don't challenge someone who has nothing to lose.
I don't think your name's Tom.
Do you have it with you?
He's afraid of the sea.
You will come to like this kind of music.
I wish Tom understood me.
My mother knows Tom's mother.
Where's a mirror?
I was stupid to make a mistake like that.
There are times when I find you really interesting.
You are what you eat.
Tom might need to help Mary.
Tom's cellphone rang.
Everyone seems to be hungry but me.
We'll be ready to start in a few minutes.
"In ancient times, plagues killed many people."
What do you think of war?
We'll meet right here.
"How are you, Tom?"
He made up that story.
Tom doesn't know the difference between good and evil.
Tom donated his estate to create a wildlife sanctuary.
Tom never forgets to give his wife flowers on their wedding anniversary.
She was told to accompany me.
Don't you like us?
I know it's none of my business.
Tom was reading a newspaper in his pajamas.
My mother made me clean the bathroom.
How about a walk on the beach?
I can barely stand up.
Was there something wrong with the car?
This is really unbelievable.
How can you tell an Englishman from an American?
Smith was arrested and put in jail.
Isn't there something you want to say to me?
I've got a surprise for you.
"By the time you get out of jail, she'll probably have gotten married."
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
The street was blocked by a huge truck.
Where did you see them?
Why would Tom be angry?
"These aren't yours, are they?"
She sings out of tune.
Tom is a psycho.
Tom seldom speaks to us anymore.
My approach will be different.
He was running for re-election.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
Who are Tom and I going to lean on when the times get rough?
"You have a thing for Mary, don't you?"
I didn't know whether to get angry or to laugh.
I wonder if this is wrong.
The union is pressing for a ten-percent pay hike.
This pencil is yours. Mine is on the desk.
He used the dictionary.
We saw a flying saucer.
I'll tell Tom you're looking for him.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
I have terrible pains.
Tom is important.
Are you even listening me?
Mary is so pretty.
There is a Picasso on the wall.
A chauffeur sat in front.
It seems very interesting.
None of them could understand what she was implying.
He is used to the work.
Tom has put on some weight.
I didn't know exactly what to say.
I heard a Japanese nightingale.
This is a time of rejoicing.
Do you know any ghost stories?
I'm a citizen of the world.
Tom watched a cartoon with his children after dinner.
Will you take it?
Don't back up. There's a tree behind you.
Is it too late for us to register?
Tom cut me off.
It's OK with me.
He didn't listen to music.
Tom forgot to ask Mary what he had planned to ask her.
"Excuse me, how much is this?"
Could you please speak a little slower?
I broke a glass when I did the dishes.
I saw his car make a turn to the right.
I'd like to go to the zoo.
The man robbed her of her bag.
Hand it to Tom.
I know what you did.
I couldn't talk Tom into coming with us.
A white car has been tailing me for the last two miles.
I got a bad grade.
You will be in charge of the babies in this room.
Tom had his chauffeur drive him to the theater.
Tom doesn't have to study.
I like music very much.
The restaurant is on the ground floor.
She is a friend of mine.
I was scolded by my mother for being lazy.
Why are you so popular?
It's just a game.
"I have 1,500 head of cattle."
That's a crime.
"Since you're going to Tom's house anyway, could you give this to Tom?"
What exactly are you afraid of?
The patient is sick beyond all hope.
I wonder why Tom was late.
Tom says he was in Boston the week before last.
The old man died of cancer.
Tom smashed his piggy bank with a hammer.
When did you have your last physical examination?
They're still young.
He told me that he would go to France in June.
I usually buy my clothes at the department store.
She heard him sing his favorite song.
I don't believe it.
We're not going out.
Tom had so much money that he did not know what to do with it. It was far more than he needed to live.
It's not my cup of tea.
My mother gave me her sewing machine.
She's been in the hospital for a month.
You've been doing a pretty good job so far.
Where is the south terminal?
Please give me a pillow and a blanket.
I'm depending on you.
I put my hand on Tom's shoulder.
Ulaanbaatar is the capital of Mongolia.
Does it look cloudy today?
Tom clapped.
Prices ought to come down soon.
"Even though he's very old, he's healthy."
The plane will arrive at three.
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
Do you think that handguns should be made illegal?
We're pretty proud of ourselves.
Where can I park?

I know Tom.

He read the book yesterday.
Don't come again.
Don't worry about things that aren't important.
Tom couldn't breathe.
I'm really glad you decided to come.
Do you want to hang out at my place?
"I'm here for you, Tom."
Tom and Mary sat together on the couch.
"All of a sudden, large drops of rain began falling from the dark sky."
Doesn't Tom sometimes do that?
We're grateful for your assistance.
No one responded.
I couldn't stop laughing.
Tom rushed in.
I never want to see him again.
Tom died three days later.
Do you want to see the house?
I accepted her invitation.
Tom spoke French quite fluently.
Do you have any employees who speak French?
"First, let's talk about Tom."
I don't want to be laughed at.
Clean the window with a damp cloth.
Welcome to our home.
He likes potato salad.
You'll get over it.
You left the door open.
You said you had important news.
Tom says that the three of you are his brothers.
Nothing was working.
"Besides lending books, libraries offer various other services."
I like reading books.
Tom should probably spend more time with Mary.
Did you tell Tom when to come?
Write only your family name in capitals.
She inherited her mother's blue eyes.
They allow parking here.
Do you think I'm ugly?
Never bite the hand that feeds you.
I heard you wanted to talk to me.
"You always say that you'll take out the garbage, but you never do."
I've always wanted to visit another country.
Tom saw Mary coming.
Have you finished reading the book?

Tom won't care.
You look contented.
Mary opposed her son's decision to get married.
Tom is indecisive.
Tom burned himself.

They're going to enlarge their store.
You should avoid making such a mistake.
This sink is made of stainless steel.
I certainly had no idea Tom was planning to move to Boston.
Shut off the water.
Tom threatened Mary.
What do they think it said?
This fish smells bad.
I wish I didn't have to work.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
What beautiful flowers!
Please turn off the light.
Where is the Russian embassy?
"Since you have nothing to do with this matter, you don't have to worry."
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Someone is knocking at the door.
How are you doing for money?
I'll never forget your kindness as long as I live.
I like you.
China is about twenty-five times as large as Japan.
We missed you very much at the party yesterday.
Darcy said nothing at all.

Tom asked Mary to marry him.
Her face suddenly turned red.
Ask me something easier.
Do you wish you could travel in space?
Get over here and be quick about it!
Tom left the house to his son.
Have they announced the court's decision yet?
This kind of experience is familiar to everybody.
Will you look after my dog while I'm out?
Think about it.
Tom looked toward Mary.
I'd like to call a meeting.
Is this your dog?
Please look at me.
"Hey, your dog just bit me."
Why are you in such a bad mood?
Tom checked out.
Everybody seeks happiness.
I have to speak to Tom immediately.
There was much work to do.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Mary is the perfect girl for me.
"The Tokyo Skytree is the second tallest structure in the world, after the Burj Khalifa."
Did you bring a weapon?
Tom can't believe Mary just said that.
I called you this afternoon.
This was avoidable.
Tom is infallible.
I'd like to book a table for four for tomorrow night.
Tom is finishing his work.
I don't want you here.
What shall we do afterwards?
Have you been to Boston before?
He will make a good team captain.
Tom can't even read.
I intend to come with you.
I'd like you to meet my son.
I'm indebted to you.
Please wait while I get a towel.
I can speak English a little.
Somebody killed Tom.
It's not his style.
I should be fine.
It's fun to visit old friends.
You mustn't stay out that late.
He was made to wait at the station for two hours.
You have to come out of there.
Trust me.
Tom demanded an explanation.
Who notified Tom?
He felt at home.
How did Tom know that?
I've lost weight recently.

She sank under the surface of the water.
Tom can hardly speak any French.
I've always wanted to go to another country.

The door was already open.
"In those days, I was still a student."
Pandas are cute.
Tom enjoys taking pictures.
You're not fast enough.

Have you ever visited Kyoto?
Give a yell if you need anything.
Tom wished that he knew Mary's telephone number.
Tom can be reasoned with.
Tom didn't know what else to do.
Tom and Mary are the same height.
She didn't give me her name.
That was an awful day.
This room heats easily.
Ask Tom instead.
Don't laugh.

Thank you for the correction.
Are you with the police?
He does everything very quickly.
Do not try to imitate her.
The population of China is about eight times as large as that of Japan.
He was unconscious for three days.
Did Tom respond?
He started washing his car.
She stayed at home all day long yesterday.
They're at home.

I love working with Tom.
What's it for?
I wouldn't have been able to do that without Tom's help.
This is a mistake.
Nobody believed you.
We went out for some drinks.
The cat crouched down ready to jump.

Tom told me that he'd like to become a doctor.
We need to get rid of that.
I was having dinner with Tom.
Tom was assertive.
I'll get a cab.
You made the right call.
I'm dissatisfied.
The boys are still playing in the sandbox.
Sorry about yesterday.
This car is good.
Wish me luck.
I have something for you to do.
Only God knows.
This mission is highly secret and extremely dangerous.
Tom has been lucky.
She makes a good living.
This is a suicide mission.
Your nose is bleeding.
I don't like both of them.

You should sue Tom.
Tom listened to my opinion.
The swimmer raised his head and gasped for breath.
Tom hates it when it's snowing.
Tom had a son.
Why are you so nice to everyone?
Are you enjoying this?
Are you going to come?

That's all that matters.
Tom is starting to feel a little better.
Tom shot the injured horse to put it out of its misery.

It's been three days.
Why aren't you coming with us?
Tom is beginning to go deaf.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Tom doesn't want to lose Mary.

We are going to visit our uncle next Sunday.
Tom doesn't even know Mary is here.
We're about the same height.

"Whether the problem is important or unimportant, you must solve it."
The work is well worth the trouble.
"If someone's in trouble, you should help them."
Tom comes here every other day.
I'm used to getting more sleep.

He's a student of Japanese literature.
The way you're doing it is wrong.
Tom is worried.
London is famous for its fog.
I only live a few blocks away.
Tom doesn't know when Mary came to Boston.
Now is not the time to panic.
Your shirts need to be washed.
Tom is a very sincere person.
Tom and Mary have known each other since they were kids.
Tom waited nervously.
I love rock.
"May I see your boarding pass, please?"
"Be quick, or you will miss the train."

Where are you from?

Where on earth were you?
Phase one is complete.
He took off his glasses.
Do you care for classical music?
You won't get rid of me that easily.
"Even though he lives next door, he doesn't even say hello to us."
Tom wants you to call him ASAP.
Are you excited?
Tom answered the policeman's questions.
Your lawyers want to see you.
They have already finished the work.
It doesn't sound too serious.
Think of your family.
Tom went to visit his grandmother at the retirement home.
I knew this moment would come.
Don't worry about me.
Unbelievable!
Someone broke the lock and stole my bike.
He's interested in many things.
Tom's curiosity was piqued.
There's something else I'd like you to do for me.
I can't help you with that.
This is one of mine.
You're so good at singing.
No one I know likes Tom anymore.
Regular attendance is required in that class.
I do not want any money.

The pay is terrible.
We're not doing this again.

Who do you think would do such a thing?
He's a talented writer.
That's a good picture.
Tom can't afford to eat at that kind of restaurant so let's go somewhere else.
"Due to the lack of students, the school will be closed at the end of the year."
"He didn't answer the phone, so I sent him an email."
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
You almost stepped on the dog's tail.
Tom didn't tell Mary anything about that.
Is this my life?
Tom went missing several days ago.
Don't you dare go there.

They were afraid of being overheard.
I really enjoyed your company.
What would you do if you were in my place?
I'm a coward when it comes to cockroaches.
We can't just cut people's salaries without giving them some warning.
Call me at the office.
Where is the French embassy?
This can't be true.
Are you good at speaking French?
Do you have a rough idea of how long it will take?
"I'm all thumbs when it comes to origami, or paper folding."
I would like to drastically decrease the amount of time it takes me to clean the house.
Let's ask the teacher.
I will stay at home.

Go away.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.

This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
Your lives will be spared.
We're not going there.

This is your dog.
I'll show you what I can do.

Are you playing with me?
Is Tom doing OK?
Get out while you can.
I don't want to be told what to do.
This is all my fault.

Tom assumed that Mary knew why John was in the hospital.
Give me a telephone call when you get back.

I'm not feeling well today.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.

Where is my plate?
Her hair came out from under her hat.
"Let's get started, OK?"
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.

Am I wrong?
I'm going to Boston to see Tom.
Let's all go to Boston together.
It was easy to fix.
I paid 300 dollars for this guitar.
Tom put aside a lot of money.
He deceived his friend.
There is nothing God cannot do.

You know me well enough to know I wouldn't do that.
Tom scares easily.
Are you brave?
What do you have to say about that?
Do you want the rest of my sandwich?
What do you think of this plan?
Only you can answer the question.

He can be trusted.
I don't think we were seen.
How are we going to get home?
How did you know Tom was here?

Tom has to be careful about what he eats.
The sad story moved us to tears.
What Tom really wanted was to be happy.
That is your book.
You're wanted on the phone.
Tom is fairly reliable.
Smoking on duty is not allowed.
Tom didn't want to tell Mary anything.
She regrets that she failed the examination.
I know what Tom knows.
Let me repair it.
Tom had company.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
I have a friend who's a pilot.
Tom weighs more than thirty kilos.
I think it's time for me to say what I really think.
How much did these sunglasses cost?
Your mother will be back before long.
He'll be safe with me.
The final score of the game was 3 to 1.
You can't leave this room.
You didn't let me finish.
Your jacket and tie don't go together.
She's very happy-go-lucky.
Help yourself to anything you like.
I don't like scary movies.
Is the movie theater near the station?
The answer is simple.
It's late. I have to go.
I know what I like.
Tom wanted Mary to talk to John about the problem she was having with his children.
Where are the clean pillowcases?
Do you know your size?
She went with him to Boston.
It was much worse than we initially thought.
His house is near the subway station.
Where are you hiding?
I'm going to take tomorrow off.
I want you to go with Tom.
Tom is going to like doing that.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I have never felt better.
All is well that ends well.
What're you doing with this?
I always get up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
Tom will sue you.
Turn the car around.
Tom wants Mary to want him.
Tom has gotten better at playing the clarinet since I last heard him play.
Is all this necessary?
What time is it now in Boston?
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself.
Tom and Mary adopted three children.
"Can I have the key now, please?"
It is a very difficult job for us.
Please don't mind me.
I probably won't watch this.
You've been keeping something from me.
Tom is lazy and spoiled.
I have to change my clothes.
Tom didn't know who Mary wanted to go to Boston with.
Thank you for asking me.
The gasoline truck ran into the gate and blew up.
We're out of milk.
I'm afraid of heights.
Did I touch a nerve?
The meeting was almost over.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent car.
Tom wants to know where you've been.
Tom and Mary sat across from John and Alice.
The boy had the dish empty in a moment.
We have no clue where he is.
She has married a nobody.
Sugar is a major cause of obesity.
Tom said he'd never planned on staying that long.
That's what they pay me for.
They named the dog Shiro.
Let's not forget who Tom is.
Tom isn't ignoring you.
"When he came, I was writing a letter."
I have something that might interest you.
Tom sent me there.
Wait a sec.
I'm going to wait here for you.
I'm getting high.
The man watched the sun set below the horizon.
A bike path goes right past my house.
We're playing baseball after work today.
Do you even remember Tom?
He does not look up to his parents.
Let's get it over with.
Please give me a cup of milk.
I dropped by just to say hello.
This is the book I want to read.
What's Tom asking?
We are happy to see you again.
Tom sells fruit.
She wants to get a driver's license.
That's what I wanted to see you about.
He resumed his work after a short break.
I am looking forward to seeing you again soon.
That lady appears to be rich.
Tom discovered a flaw in the ship's design.
I rented a house with a garage.
The meeting is about to start.
I like this. I'll take it.
I have read the book.
She was clearly satisfied with the results.
This book seemed interesting.
I knew this would happen.
Are you sure you want to do it?
"If you were to win the lottery, what would you buy with the money?"
The temperature fell several degrees.
I went by there last night.
I get the impression that you aren't telling the truth.
I don't think you're fat.
Tom said that he was feeling thirsty.
Tom doesn't seem to like anybody here.
"Without your encouragement, I would have given up this plan."
Let's discuss this at another time.
I can't convince Tom.
I just want to be with you.
I mistook Mary for Alice.
I won't get caught.
He put the blame upon me.
We're pretty disappointed.
You still haven't answered my question.
It was impressive.
Tom is humiliated.
He likes both music and sports.
"If she goes to the theater, I'll stay at home."
I know you've been through a lot.
Unbelievable!
I'll think about it.
Tom certainly fooled us all.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
I was feeling blue.
You can't just lie to Tom.
"To tell the truth, I don't really like him."
What's the destination of this ship?
The day will soon come when man can travel to Mars.
Tom couldn't find his way back home.
Give us some space.
Tom said he hopes you won't be late again tomorrow.
Can you eat raw oysters?
We learn English at school.
What a long flight!
We don't have a dishwasher.
It exploded with a loud noise.
"Subway fares will be raised as of April 1st, 1999."
I wasn't always happy.
Tom gave me a really cool gift.
What did Tom tell you about me?
Tom wanted Mary to look for John.
Tom ran out of the room.
We are boiling water.
Can you teach me how to play the guitar like you do?
"After the hike, Tom switched from his hiking boots to his sneakers."
Let's negotiate.
Are you here voluntarily?
What do you take pride in?
He waved at her.
Tom will keep you posted.
I want to study abroad.
Sometimes a friendly gesture is worth more than a thousand words.
Does he know me?
"I want to get married, just not to you."
Tom is young and ambitious.
Tom put the engagement ring on Mary's finger.
He did what he had been told.
There is no use crying for help. No one will hear you.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
"To be honest, I don't know."
Is this a riddle?
I took a book from the shelf.
That can't be helped.
Tom is a friend of the family.
This is non-negotiable.
It is clear that the ship sank.
Get back to work right away.
I am up to my neck in work.
We're about thirty minutes behind schedule.
We have not seen each other since our school days.
Nobody ever told me that before.
The car bumper absorbed some of the impact.
Tom and Mary were looking at each other.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
Whose son are you?
Let's begin with that question.
The cowboys rounded up the herd of cattle.
The company is in financial difficulties.
This first question is for you.
Tom kept Mary waiting.
I learned that the hard way.
Few students are interested in reading this novel.
She will fail eventually.
She acted as if she knew nothing about it.
I don't like this place.
Watch out! There's a pothole in the road.
"If he saw you, he'd be surprised."
Tom is special.
No one's shooting at us now.
Tom asked Mary to wait in the lobby.
Tom seems like a decent kid.
I'd like to try out this new model before I buy it.
How many times a week do you study French?
Are you going to tell me that you and Tom never dated?
You can borrow mine.
I told you the concert was going to be boring. Why didn't you believe me?
This house is too small to live in.
You cannot be too careful.
He must not live.
What good is this?
Tom is not who you think he is.
Tom must've seen Mary there.
I'm not sure I want that.
We can't let Tom have that diamond.
Face the music.
The Maori language is spoken in New Zealand.
There are twenty-five students in the assembly hall.
What's the distance from here to Salamanca?
This doesn't involve you.
We need to talk.
How many brothers do you have?
She was married to a rich man.
Are you OK?
I seized the cat by the neck.
Ask them.
You shouldn't have paid the bill.
Tom bet $300 on the race.
No one knows the future.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
I always drink a cup of coffee every morning.
You are entitled to your opinion.
My work is just beginning.
"Are you happy? ""Yes, I suppose I am."""
I've just been to the post office.
Is it five already?
I should not have done that. It was wrong.
She bit him.
You saved my life.
Tom Jackson has set a new world record.
Who is your favorite author?
You could drive home by yourself.
The paper published a profile of its new editor.
I'd like to go through just one day without being told I look like my brother.
Just go back to where you came from.
Tom threw out the old newspapers.
We both know what you're doing.
They forced him to tell the truth.
He often reads far into the night.
Tom and Mary are both thirty.
Don't you have a pen?
We might have underestimated his ability.
Appearances can be deceptive.
I don't want you to do that.
You can't let Tom behave that way.
We saw you come in.
The message was in French.
I live in an old house.
She looked after her baby.
Do you live here?
"She is not my sister, she's my wife."
It's all very new to me.
She is shy and always remains in the background.
"I am allowed 1,000 yen a month for books."
It was too easy.
We must help each other.
I love animals.
I don't want to ruin your day.
Tell me a story.
Mary showed Alice her engagement ring.
Call me if you need assistance.
I know what it smells like.
This is better.
She may be a nurse. I am not sure.
Tom wouldn't cry.
It's my fault this has happened.
The story cannot be true.
Is there any room for me?
"If I were to tell you the truth, you would be surprised."
Someone is playing the piano.
Tom lives on a tropical island.
I'll call.
That will save me a lot of trouble.
I know this isn't easy.
That's really stupid.
The problem resolved itself.
Tom disappointed me.
English is used by many people.
You don't know me.
Haven't you done anything yet?
This is why she is still angry with me.
I can read without glasses.
I heard a dog barking in the distance.
She called the students into the room.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
Tom can't handle this anymore.
Put it in the drawer.
Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
I didn't like that.
It's pouring down rain.
Tell me what I need to know.
Please tell me your name.
He was surprised by the sudden appearance of his friend.
We can't trust him because he often tells lies.
Even Tom lied.
You don't sound happy.
Birds fly.
She sold him her car.
How much property does the landlord own?
Tom was drunk and obnoxious at the party.
Please tell me you're kidding.
"He told the truth, otherwise he would have been punished."
It's already too late.
I knew Tom wasn't ready to quit.
I don't want to work here anymore.
Tom would wait.
A book not worth reading is not worth buying in the first place.
What do you think of war?
I'm not in any particular hurry.
Have you ever thought of becoming a nurse?
"Bring me a sheet of paper, please."
She kissed him.
We had so much fun together.
Why did you decide to study English?
That blue dress suits you very well.
I don't want to hurt you.
The ground is still wet.
Are you impressed?
We have no means of transportation.
I deserve more.
I think Tom can be trusted.
"Excuse me, I have a request."
"That's your answer for everything, isn't it?"
You should've gone there by yourself.
I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
He stopped reading the newspaper.
I'm going to leave one night early.
Were you born in a barn?
She has a sense of humor.
At first I tried to write everything down in my notebook.
You always make mistakes.
Here come the police. Let's get out of here.
This isn't the only key.
Tom believed it.
Can he speak English?
I love this mobile phone.
Let me see that list.
"I don't know when, but it's likely to happen before next Monday."
May I park here for a while?
Mary was the only girl wearing a skirt.
Belgrade has about 2 million inhabitants.
Today was a very tough day.
Stop yelling at me.
I'm not understanding anything.
Everyone else is fine.
Is your room clean?
He is very honest.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
"I'm hungry, too."
I never realized how much I'd miss you.
Why is everything so difficult?
Tom was horrified.
I have a reservation for two nights.
I think we need those.
I'm not sure if I'll go.
Tom is inspired.
He wrote a lot of stories.
Tom says that he can't imagine going out in this weather.
She must have visited England last summer.
Tom blacked out.
Tom doesn't look like his father.
I need to be more careful.
What is over there?
I think you'll be impressed.
Our mother had no choice but to make dinner with leftovers.
You're silly.
The boy is nice.
Tom attends public school.
Paper catches fire easily.
How may I help you?
Tom is so irresponsible. I can't believe it.
Are you sure you don't want anything to eat?
You did a really good job.
I am eating noodles.
I come here every Monday.
You're never too old to learn.
What did they find?
Let's go to eat together.
This chair is made from recycled materials.
The two men were arrested for reckless driving.
Do Tom and Mary both live in Boston?
The plan was being discussed.
It took me several hours to repair it.
What have you been doing all week?
Tom stopped suddenly.
That happens a lot here.
I wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.
Did you see the lunar eclipse yesterday?
Tom has been dead for three years.
What would you like?
You're welcome to come with us if you want to.
Tom wasn't joking.
"I would've told you, but Tom made me promise not to."
Tom and Mary hugged each other.
I'll tell you later.
I put my gloves on inside out by mistake.
It is next to impossible for you to finish the work in a day.
The earth is different from the other planets in that it has water.
My father was an actor.
I grew tomatoes last year and they were very good.
What did you miss?
Tom is dozing.
Tom was interrupted by a knock at the door.
That would really be great.
I have what you're looking for.
Let's leave the problem until tomorrow.
I think I'm drunk.
I'd like to have a word with you.
I want to hold your hand.
Tom appeared calm.
"If it's all the same to you, I think I'll give it a miss."
What kind of person does something like that?
I have nothing to do with that crime.
What a fool I was to do such a thing!
You made it.
Everyone lies to me.
I'll phone you when I arrive.
Tom just barely managed to earn enough money to pay the rent.
I'm the owner of this restaurant.
What did you promise to do?
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom has been sick for a week.
Mary wrote her number on a piece of paper and handed it to Tom.
How long have you been in here?
There is no future in his job.
Tom says he doesn't like money.
Tom was hiding behind a bush.
The tree is about as high as the roof.
Would you answer some questions for me?
"Sit down, please."
"Give me a light, would you?"
Tom isn't going to stop.
Tom needs a coat.
"No matter what you say, I am convinced that I am right."
I'm a doctor.
Can we provide assistance?
"When the storm was over, we began to make preparations to leave the port."
Tom read the sports section first.
His old cat is still alive.
He can play a flute.
Do you have snow tires for your car?
Reading a lot of books is a good thing.
"We'll find a solution, I'm sure."
Do you think such a thing is possible?
I'm really busy at the moment.
He finally got his wish.
I hear my uncle died of cancer.
"To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what happened."
That's just what I was going to say.
I'm in a desperate situation.
We are home.
Stop that!
The almond trees are in bloom.
He may have read the letter.
That's dumb.
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
Tom didn't sound worried.
We're almost out of sugar.
The noise is getting louder and louder.
Of course it's not true.
The police caught the thief.
What's the nationality of that cameraman over there?
I have not seen her lately.
Don't pick up that phone.
Let me give you a piece of advice.
That is mine. I don't know where yours is.
Tom is a bit younger than me.
As soon as the bell rang the teacher came into the classroom.
Tom said that he lost his key.
That's something worth considering.
Then what?
Do you want to know why I'm here?
I'll be nice.
Where have you been?
Thank you for doing this.
Tom talks to Mary a lot.
I basically like your plan.
Have you eaten your dinner already?
Tom is a boy's name and Mary is a girl's name.
"We went to the theater early, so we could be sure that everyone could get a seat."
Mary is in love with the boy with blond hair.
This looks like a gunshot wound.
How do you like that?
We just got here.
The government is being urged to take a proactive approach to reducing carbon emissions.
No one escaped alive.
Tom was killed in a car crash.
He made the company what it is today.
Tom regularly attends church.
This will be difficult to do.
Tom decided to try sleeping without a pillow.
Are you from Kyoto?
It never occurred to me that she was sick and in the hospital.
Chicken pox is a common sickness in children.
Nobody else offered to help.
I don't like her face.
I don't like this.
The problem is Tom's complete unwillingness to negotiate.
We arrived first.
She is proud that her son has become a doctor.
Tom smokes like a chimney.
It is high time you went to bed.
Did you read the book that won the prize?
Are you one of Tom's relatives?
The water is warm.
Tom might not be as happy as he looks.
I was not pleased by your rude behavior.
"We tried it again, but couldn't do it."
It didn't work.
Do you like to travel?
This room is air-conditioned.
It was not until yesterday that I heard about the accident.
I knew it was a bad idea.
She has to stop smoking.
We've found it.
I'll be with you in a second.
The government is considering tax cuts.
Come out and play.
Tom was very disappointed.
"No matter what I do, she says I can do better."
We met along the way.
When was the last time you took the subway?
Tom took Mary's picture with his iPhone.
Tell me why you aren't planning on going to Australia with us.
It's a stupid policy.
Where are you taking us?
He is accustomed to working hard.
I thought Tom had been told.
Tom felt something was wrong.
Tom asked Mary why she was late.
Tom was very mean to Mary.
"He said, ""I want to be a scientist."""
I can't leave until I find out who Tom is.
"To tell the truth, I completely forgot."
Tom didn't die in vain.
"What do you want, anyway?"
Tom doesn't want you.
You must read between the lines.
The last time I saw Tom he was wearing a hospital gown.
Tom is quite picky.
"Where's your car, Tom?"
Tom said that Mary may do that.
Did Tom really break up with Mary?
It's a cruel world.
Is Tom out there?
Tom complained to Mary about the food.
Tom and Mary are mad at John.
Tell me if you need anything else.
Keep away from the dog.
Are you going to go with Tom?
Almost everybody was invited.
Here's your order.
It took me a long time to get over it.
The soldier took shelter in the foxhole.
The sky is becoming cloudy.
What's your price?
Mary made the kids breakfast.
You need not do it at once.
I used my imagination.
Will you do that?
He is working as a security guard at a warehouse.
Both of you are right.
She gave an oral report to her boss.
I have a sore throat and a fever.
I'll have to think about that.
What you did took courage.
My wife and kids were there.
Tom is perfect.
Go to bed. It's a school night.
It must've been expensive.
Tom and Mary shook hands.
She didn't reply.
Shall I come to your office?
Tom told me it was none of my business.
Why did you turn down his request for a pay raise?
What do you want to learn?
Tom's not here.
Anything new?
They looked up at the sky.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
Tom is in terrible danger.
Do you know the meaning of this word?
You are very beautiful.
Tom said he didn't know what was wrong.
You're so lazy.
Tom knows how to cook spaghetti.
"You have a car, don't you?"
Some of them are really fine.
"At the best hotels, there is always someone at your beck and call."
The streetlight over there is broken.
I'll explain the matter to you later on.
Tom doesn't have a clue.
I'll be in touch if I have any more questions.
I don't know how deep the lake is.
I played tennis with Tom yesterday.
Tom had no idea where Mary had graduated from high school.
Who is this lady?
That's what I want to ask.
Green is my favorite color.
How do I know it's you?
I thought you might like to know who's coming to our party.
"If it snows a lot tomorrow, let's make a snowman."
I am diabetic.
What's your Skype username?
I love comedies.
I'm not used to driving in this kind of traffic.
Did Tom send you?
I didn't write that.
He told me that his grandfather is over ninety.
The boss wants to see you.
We got up at dawn to avoid a traffic jam.
I like to eat apples.
Her idea is very similar to mine.
Please sit on this chair and wait.
I want you to be ready when Tom gets here.
Can you describe the object?
This factory produces CD players.
Tom will forgive you eventually.
The beauty of the scenery was beyond description.
Tom was starving.
You won't believe what happened to me today.
I cannot do without this dictionary.
Tom drives an old Ford.
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
Tell me something about yourself.
Anything you say may be held against you in a court of law.
"The more we have, the more we want."
What are you doing up here?
I broke both of my legs.
Why would I be jealous?
It is dangerous for children to play near this pond.
I think it looks great.
No one's in sight.
Tom is a rebellious boy.
I'd like to hear you sing.
Why were you in Boston?
Keep your classroom clean.
Tom often comes to Boston.
"You're angry, aren't you?"
I know your type.
What do you say to a beer?
Tom brushes his teeth after every meal.
I think she's an honest woman.
"At the age of six, I was taken to a circus for the first time."
Tom taught me how to cook.
We'll get a keg of beer for the party.
I don't want charity.
My mother is busy preparing supper.
I know those girls.
"Come on, Tom. We're leaving."
Bunk beds are a way to save space.
What you say makes no sense.
"The only word written on the page was the word ""frog."""
Would you give me a discount?
I want you to turn off the radio.
There's no way that Tom could have stolen the money without being seen.
Your shelf is full of books.
I haven't seen any of my old classmates since I graduated 15 years ago.
Tom accused me of having broken my promise.
This year the region has been hit by a severe drought.
This is what Tom feared.
My watch is very accurate.
You'll feel better after a bath.
Did you find any fingerprints on the wineglass?
Mom! Stop! You're embarrassing me.
Everyone likes her.
I eat Chinese food once in a blue moon.
I have to admit it's very tempting.
That's a stupid idea.
Wow! You've lost a lot of weight.
This happens to me all the time.
It was the start of a long friendship.
I'm used to no one liking me.
Tom went to visit Mary even though I told him not to.
Tom is moving out of town at the end of this month.
Tom didn't look at the picture again.
She is crying.
I've only seen it once.
Do you think I should go up there?
Mary made the kids breakfast.
You have brought shame upon our family.
I owe Tom money.
I try to avoid walking by the cemetery after dark.
We know that.
That story is a famous one that everyone knows.
You have to answer the question.
Why are you back from lunch so soon?
We were just talking about you.
"If we're not careful, one of us is going to get hurt."
Tom can only remember one of his grandparents.
No one will ever find you.
Have you finished yet?
She is not herself today.
Is that just a coincidence?
You're the man.
I didn't remember to send Tom a birthday card.
Is your room clean?
Tom admired himself in the mirror.
Tom's shot missed the target by two feet.
Tom is shorter than Mary.
I had an operation for glaucoma last year.
How do you feel about that?
Tom doesn't always pay attention to details.
Earth is the third planet from the sun.
Tom doesn't live far from where he works.
"Had I known your telephone number, I would have called you."
"If it were not for her help, I would not succeed."
She went from London to Paris.
I'm a little tired.
Nobody seems to know where Tom is.
Is it all paid for?
You are both welcome to come with us.
I feel comfortable in her company.
Please take off your shoes.
I'm from Turkey.
Can I watch videos on this phone?
Tom and Mary weren't there.
I can't hear Tom.
Tom should be back at 2:30.
Tom stroked the cat's head.
I'm very discrete.
We have lunch at noon every day.
She always wears black.
Tom watched his granddaughters dance.
Tom's a natural when it comes to games involving hand-eye coordination.
His chances of being elected are good.
"Tom is stupid, but Mary isn't."
Tom is a psychic.
That's not what I heard.
This pizza is cold.
Delicious looking food doesn't necessarily taste good.
I don't have a choice.
I'm afraid it's too late now.
I saw her leaving the room.
It's locked.
I'm about Tom's age.
I was in London most of the summer.
Put your hands against the wall.
The old woman had a narrow escape from being run over by a car.
Could I have a slice of cheesecake?
Tom isn't lying.
Who do you think will win?
Tom blocked Mary's way and wouldn't let her enter the room.
We used to go to the movies on Saturday evening.
Tom asked Mary if she knew how to read.
Tom hasn't been here in a long time.
We'll walk.
You can eat lunch here in this room.
I don't want anyone to see me like this.
I told you I have a girlfriend.
Do you really think I should see a therapist?
He's opposed to racial discrimination.
Tom and Mary both work eight hours a day.
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
It's your home.
What's your favorite time waster?
"If UFOs were to attack the earth, what would become of us?"
I was feeling blue.
Tom made it clear that he didn't want Mary at his party.
The ship was at the mercy of the waves.
Bring me two pieces of chalk.
He believes that the story is true.
Get away!
Have a nice time.
There is little hope of success.
He's not in.
Tom is waiting for you to say something.
A fortune-teller read my hand.
The meeting will be held this afternoon.
That swimsuit looks really good on you.
I figured it wouldn't hurt to wait for a few more minutes.
You're still green.
I need to pay the rent.
Children watch adults.
You won't believe what I just saw.
"Death is certain, only the time is not certain."
Tom disappointed me.
I suppose you want to ask Tom some questions.
The dogs barked furiously at the intruder.
I don't like the way I look.
Have you ever heard someone speaking in French?
He tried in vain to open the locked door.
How many languages do you speak?
Tom only has faint memories of his grandfather.
He studied English history.
Tom got remarried recently.
It is nice and cool here.
Tom is satisfied.
I assume you are talking about Tom.
I'll remember today for as long as I live.
Tom hasn't spoken to me about it yet.
The ice melted into a puddle of water.
I had a terrible dream.
I wrote a song for you.
What do I need this for?
I never forgot you.
Tom hasn't used it for over a year.
My hands are cold.
I know him by his first name.
The office held a memorial for him.
Tom was trapped.
I have a crush on you.
Why are they saying that?
Go play with Tom.
Why are you avoiding me?
We drove to Boston last month.
Do it as you are told.
"Tell us the truth, Tom."
What will you do?
Tom is grieving.
Read the book aloud.
Your cat is driving me crazy.
Tom has a big box of stuff in my attic.
Tom can run faster than me.
Tom gets mad very easily.
Let's start with Lesson Ten.
You must do your best.
I'm not angry at all of you.
Ask Tom where he lives.
When did you last sharpen this knife?
Don't worry about me.
I'm ruined.
How is Tom now?
They wiped out the enemy.
What would you do if you failed?
Why won't you answer?
Tom and I were alone.
Tom is lying ill in bed.
He's the president of the bank.
We need money.
Love is stronger than death.
I am sure he'll tell you as soon as he comes.
"In the U.S., it is common for people to write a check instead of paying cash."
I never expected to meet her in a place like that.
The student was kind enough to show me the way.
Tell me about it!
Mary is a remarkable woman.
Prices are double what they were two years ago.
Don't take me seriously. I'm only joking.
All Tom wants to do is swim.
Don't jump!
Tom and Mary are in the car waiting for us.
Tom doesn't live far from here.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be married.
Is there any way I can blame this on you?
Tom criticized Mary in front of everyone.
Go and fetch Tom.
"I have read both of these books, but neither of them is interesting."
Tom is the only man that Mary has ever loved.
I'm a big fan of golf.
You're a good journalist.
I can't just let Tom kill me.
Whose phone number is this?
It's six degrees below zero.
"I wanted to go to Boston with Tom, but he said he didn't want to go with me."
We always play tennis on Saturday morning.
It doesn't matter so much.
Are you saying you don't like it?
"Aren't you happy, Tom?"
Do you know us?
Why were you eating by yourself?
We'll need Tom's help.
I will be free tomorrow afternoon.
I have to work tomorrow.
Tom went into Mary's office.
"His name is Tom, not John."
Just give us a couple of minutes.
I just found out about it.
How do you like your beef stew?
I should tell Tom I want to find another job.
She speaks Russian.
I guess all we can do is wait.
A crowd was gathering around him.
He received me cordially.
Please don't use French.
I grabbed the dog by its collar.
Nobody knows you're here.
How long have you been abroad?
Why is he doing this?
No one works there anymore.
Are you a student?
Tom didn't want to disappoint his parents.
They broke down part of the wall.
I didn't like the price.
The doctor advised him to work less.
How does Tom do that?
What year is it?
Tom used a crowbar to pry open the lid of the crate.
English is spoken all over the world.
He's in Tokyo.
What do you learn English for?
"Many young people with piercings stay together their whole lives, especially if one gets their nose ring stuck in the other's braces."
I am ashamed of your conduct.
Tom shaved off his mustache.
I knew your father.
I lost my camera.
How did you manage that?
Do I need an operation?
I forgot to ask Tom for his advice.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom has stamina.
I didn't even consider that.
We enjoyed the quiz show on television last night.
He has fallen in love with me.
I'm not going to reveal their secrets.
That's quite absurd.
I'm from Kyoto.
How many bowls of soup did you eat?
You have dishonored the family.
Do you have hard evidence?
Where's the nearest hospital?
"If you have finished reading the book, return it to the library."
I am always tense before I get on an airplane.
Thanks very much for having me to dinner the other night.
What is the doctor doing?
I will go provided that she comes.
We just finished.
Tom doesn't think Mary is broke.
I'm going to shut up now.
I can't stay long today.
Watch out for cars when you cross the street.
What are some good foods to eat with potatoes?
"No, thank you. I'm just looking."
I tried to talk a friend of mine out of getting married.
This'll be fun.
The Virgin Mary is Jesus' mother.
Keep your cigarettes dry.
I heard her singing in her room.
Tom wasn't the one who borrowed my car.
Her daughter has what it takes to be a good teacher.
I had to open my suitcase.
Tom sat down on the desk.
I have read three Shakespearian works up to now.
We can't go back to the way things were.
"About this time tomorrow, we'll be climbing Mt. Fuji."
I think I should probably go.
What did you do yesterday?
Tom stood quietly.
Tom is like his father.
Such a lifestyle appears rather uninteresting to Americans.
Who is your friend?
Tom would've succeeded if he'd worked harder.
"Much to my surprise, the door opened noiselessly."
Tom never had doubts.
"We can't be sure, can we?"
Tom didn't seem very enthusiastic.
Tom and I used to visit each other every weekend.
Tom couldn't think of Mary without remembering how painful their breakup had been.
Which eye is hurting you?
What products are currently on sale?
I'm glad that you asked Tom for advice.
We can't seem to find our way back home.
You should wash your hair.
We need to fill up at the next gas station.
You are late.
Tell me what Tom said.
My husband is lazy.
Why are they here?
Nobody suspected anything.
"Come on, trust me."
You were supposed to be watching the baby.
Let's go back to the motel.
I have a sore throat.
How many rooms are there on the second floor of your house?
I can read Spanish easily.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
They ate and drank wine.
"It's time for me to go, kids."
He showed us a picture of his mother.
I am to meet him there.
I'll never treat you the way Tom treated you.
What's Tom good at?
It's just a friendly competition.
Who did you meet?
He's learning French so he can get a better salary.
Tom is very articulate.
How lucky I am!
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
They're the cream of the crop.
Who do you think broke the window?
Give me that iron ball.
You'd better be careful.
Tom woke up a little before noon.
Tom has dyed his hair black.
Tom told me you need help.
They're just doing their job.
Do you remember me?
We have to do the best we can.
To what degree can we trust him?
We arrived in Boston the day before yesterday.
American kitchens are much bigger than Japanese ones.
I've met you before.
Please open it.
May I ask a couple of questions?
There has been a lot of sickness in my family this winter.
Would it be better to start early?
There's only one way out of here.
I saw a house with a red roof.
Meat should not be eaten raw.
Tom came home from school earlier than usual.
I didn't tell Tom that I knew you.
I wish you the best of luck.
The box will serve as a table.
Tom is quite good at cooking.
I had no idea what I should write.
Why don't you come in and we'll talk about it over a cup of coffee.
I said I'd be there.
Where did you find the keys?
What would you do if you had great wealth?
Who's Tom and how does he know me?
"As was expected, Tom won the race."
Control yourself.
That's the snag.
Tom is getting restless.
Put it on.
Tom asked Mary to open the window.
He lent me two books.
Is this your cat?
"It seems OK on paper, but I wonder if it's going to work."
No one had an answer.
The audience gave Tom a standing ovation.
He is young and immature.
Tom brought some toys for the children.
Tom and Mary want to see us.
"If Tom can't tell me, then no one can."
Tom keeps his tools in the garage.
Don't come here anymore.
How long do I have to stay?
Tom worked for us for three years.
When will your new novel come out?
How do you like that?
It's difficult to read kanji.
Can we afford it?
Can I talk to you?
When do you eat breakfast?
We had known him for five years when he died.
Do you remember me?
He is going to be a father soon.
I believe I have now told you everything.
One of us has to do it.
Tom and I have both been to Boston.
Two plus two makes four.
Are you good at playing the piano?
He is a bit of a coward.
I have an appointment with the doctor.
Tom is a bad driver.
Tom said that he thought that he knew what the problem was.
I don't like big dogs.
Do you like going to work?
My wife is hiding something from me.
Nobody knows what goes on behind those doors.
"When Tom is at home, he doesn't want to talk about work."
You know Tom can't do that very well.
I think you went too far.
We're all hungry.
I giggled.
Everybody hates Tom.
I'm so sorry.
Why were you yelling?
The news spread like wildfire.
My French teacher is the same age as I am.
I have to wash my hands and brush my teeth.
It happened just the way Tom said it did.
Now we know what happened.
It's dark.
I can't get rid of this cold.
It appears that you are all mistaken.
I go to the movies once a month.
What's the point of this?
"It is cheap, but on the other hand it is not good."
I was the one who taught Tom how to read.
I used to be Tom's French teacher.
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom said that he thought Mary knew why John had become a policeman.
I told Tom how proud I was of him.
I wonder what Tom would do in a situation like this.
I know that most people here don't like me very much.
Tom plunged to his death.
I'll answer for this man's honesty.
I have a proposal.
That was obviously a stupid idea.
I have a bad feeling about this.
What are you guys up to?
Fish'n'chips is the most famous English food.
Did you take the book back to the library?
I handed in my report yesterday.
A rush-hour traffic jam delayed my arrival by two hours.
I wonder if Tom has ever considered going to a specialist.
I want it to stop.
Am I hurting you?
My money seems to disappear by the end of the month.
No one knew why.
Some of the dogs are alive.
Tom isn't wearing a shirt.
Tom searched every nook and cranny of the house looking for his wallet.
Tom couldn't have shot anyone.
Don't do this again.
She works for a hospital.
This is your only chance.
I know what kind of people Tom and Mary are.
Tom said Mary was planning on going surfing.
Look ahead.
I'm being accused of doing things I didn't do.
I'm sorry to have caused you such inconvenience.
Perhaps you'd be willing to volunteer to take care of the children.
I've got a little job for you.
I often listen to sad songs.
I have only two classes this year.
"How could you do this to us, Tom?"
I just want to make sure that his offer has no strings attached.
"Compared to our house, his is a palace."
Tom loves us.
Where are you hurt?
Both brothers are still alive.
Is Tom still engaged to Mary?
"Tom deposited 1,000 dollars in his saving account."
You're not as tall as I am.
I think this is a good thing.
I will join a golf club.
What places does that tour visit?
"If I had wanted your help, I would have asked for it."
Thank you for the beautiful flowers.
I'll travel across Europe by bicycle this summer.
Tom is the one you want.
That's what we're here for.
Do you know the meaning of this word?
Where did she go yesterday?
Tom probably knows more than he's telling us.
When did it occur?
Your feet are dirty.
Isn't that enough for you?
Tom is the one who'll do the cooking.
"Even if it rains tomorrow, I'll go there."
"A sumo wrestler thinks nothing of consuming 20,000 calories a day."
The bus was two minutes early.
The adventure begins.
Tom's French is better than mine.
This movie is suitable for children.
I'd like to introduce some friends of mine.
We have tried everything.
I gave Tom my word that I wouldn't talk to Mary about that.
Tom explained how he lost his money.
Do you want to look into it?
We must stay perfectly calm.
Tom's living proof that you don't have to have brains to be successful.
Tom confessed to stealing the money.
Tom's parents are very strict.
Are you in love?
He's always dissatisfied.
Tom is going to be sorry that he didn't do that.
"Give us two knives and four forks, please."
I'd never been to Boston before.
Come quickly.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
I was really scared.
I will go on a trip.
I came to tell you not to worry.
The rich are not always happy.
All is well with me.
That's what I heard.
Some students find it difficult to follow the rules.
We make a great team.
I tried to fulfill my duty.
I climbed to the top of Mt. Fuji.
He was badly wounded.
"I'm so tired, I can hardly keep my eyes open."
Tom hopes he didn't botch the job.
The economy of the island is dependent on the fishing industry.
Are you on your way home?
Do you agree with Tom's recommendations?
Tom was just pretending to be asleep.
Everything is going very well.
He seems to know the secret.
Tom applied for a passport.
Tom thinks that he's the center of the universe.
Just ignore him.
Mary and Alice are sisters.
I loved that movie when I was a kid.
I don't want to go to Boston with you.
I'm not very good at swimming.
I was moved by his tears.
You're being very rude.
English is not hard to learn.
"He said, ""Leave me alone."""
My wife was pregnant at the time.
Is the water cold?
Tom forgot Mary's address.
Mary is a midwife.
I'm pretty sure Tom's will be at the party.
Tom became angry.
We all trust you.
I should've introduced myself.
I can't trust him.
It is the in thing to do.
A rat ran across the road.
Tom just proposed.
Tom wasn't telling the truth about where he'd been.
I know what Tom is like.
"Our captain got sick, so I attended the meeting in his place."
Tom quite often exaggerates.
This factory produces CD players.
Hippopotamuses love water.
"I thought something was going to happen, but nothing did."
I'm 18 years old.
I think you've been lied to.
We want to be here for Tom.
Tom had a problem with Mary.
Tom excused himself and left.
Tom is amazingly well informed.
I'll give you Dr. Shiegal's telephone number.
Tom bought a camera from Mary.
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
It is said that the poor are not always unhappy.
Do whatever you like.
She will have her own way.
"When you're right, you're right."
Nobody wants you to do this.
Tom took off one of his gloves.
He denied that he had accepted the bribe.
He turned around and looked back.
She left with her friends.
My clothes are over there.
This river is about one third as long as the Shinano.
Something came up.
Would you like me to help you with your luggage?
Try to concentrate.
Please don't look at me like that.
I'm just doing my job.
I can't find the light switch.
Is that how you do it?
Tom blames Mary for everything.
Tom and Mary fell into each other's arms.
"You're blushing! ""No, I'm not."""
I thought I was going to faint.
The police will be very interested to learn that you're keeping Tom locked up in the basement.
We have to put the piano on its side in order to get it in.
It's not right to treat people like this.
I'm very proud of you.
Tom returned fire.
I am eating fruit.
Tom was supposed to assist me.
Food is too expensive.
Tom sung a song.
The car made an abrupt turn.
Tom and Mary walked for a moment in silence.
This work can be finished in half an hour.
I've discussed this situation with Tom.
Tom said it didn't matter.
Tom isn't unhappy.
You're better off not getting in his way!
Do you really want to know?
It's unacceptable.
How did you get up there?
Why did you show it to me?
Camels have three eyelids.
Turn right at the next corner.
I hope we're not too late.
I thought it was really cute.
I'd like to think that there's more to it than that.
I live next door to the toy shop.
Could I help you?
I love this mobile phone.
"Anything that can possibly go wrong, does."
You're thirty thousand dollars in debt.
Please hurry.
"They're friends of yours, aren't they?"
You've got my helmet.
The pan is too hot.
I don't think there's any need for Tom to attend the meeting.
Tom says what he thinks.
Tom will get married next month.
Tom practiced hard every day.
He's just an amateur.
We competed with each other for the prize.
I've only spoken to Tom once.
"As soon as the game started, it began to rain."
Tom's laughing could be heard three blocks away.
She was dressed in red.
Are you for or against the bill?
There wasn't a living soul there.
"Tom isn't funny, but Mary is."
You don't sing very well.
"Are you ready, Tom?"
Let him do it.
I was bored.
Why don't we take Tom there?
Who'd you invite?
We couldn't help feeling sorry for her.
It takes fifteen minutes to walk from here to the campus.
My girlfriend is very possessive.
Quiet down.
You're still shaking.
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
Hold on. Just let me collect my thoughts.
I translated the poem the best I could.
This house has two bathrooms.
I am hoarse from yelling so much.
We're in a blind alley.
I meant it as a joke.
You're escaping.
I wish to go abroad.
You keep on making the same mistake time after time.
It's a dead end.
We can't just do nothing all day.
Do you know what he has done?
I never swim by myself.
It is very brave of you to vote against the plan.
That's my sole concern.
How long will it take to finish the work?
It seems impossible that you're that old.
I think you've made a big mistake.
Tom believes everything Mary says.
Tom gave his dog something to eat.
I go to church by car.
He didn't say a single word.
Tom always seems to be on the phone with Mary.
Tom was lucky that he didn't get killed.
Do you often travel abroad?
"I don't know what you're cooking, but it smells really good."
It was load off my mind.
Tom dropped this.
I'm really happy that we won.
He hurt his left hand with a knife.
Tom knows my number.
Tom sent me a funny text message.
Can you really predict the future?
Teachers also learn from their students.
Are you on Facebook?
I don't understand it.
His wife is French.
They both blushed.
I think I can.
What did Tom and Mary name their baby?
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can.
Tom asked Mary how much she weighed.
She was so angry that she could not speak.
Tom broke in.
My cough is getting worse.
"Did you say something, dear?"
She waved at me before she got on board the plane.
Can you think of any reasons?
I don't have a computer at home.
What do you want to do about Tom?
I can't work for you.
Tell Tom I'll be back.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow?
I thought I knew everything.
The British Parliament is divided into the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
I received a sweater from her on my birthday.
We often associate black with death.
I seriously doubt that.

Would you take part in the project?
That's a pretty dress.
He will pay 20 dollars at most.
Tom believed that John was his brother.
Two seats remained vacant.
I met Tom yesterday.
It's not really a competition.
The girl is small for her age.
You look like a boy.
She takes dinner to his house every evening.
You must not speak so loudly here.
We're dancing.
We saw a bird in the distance.
About half of the world's population is Asian.
Tom wants to know when you're coming home.
I've never loved anyone as much as much as I love Tom.
Tom is in the living room watching an old movie.
Tom is going to be there.
Tom met a pretty girl at the party.
"At first, everything proceeded according to plan."
The hotel is down there.
Tom would fight back.
My arm hurts.
He often tells us we must help one another.
"In case you haven't noticed, I've been waiting for two hours."
Tom will come at 2:30.
"I know it's kind of late, but would you mind if I came over now? I have something I need to discuss with you."
I miss my parents so much.
"This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday."
Let me know if you need help.
Everybody's crying.
Who vanished?
I am able to drive a car.
We sometimes make mistakes.
Does anyone else use your account?
Tom's dog ate the breadcrumbs.
Beware of imitations.
They don't want us to see what they're doing.
He tried to get her on the phone without success.
Tom owns a theater.
Tom's French is gradually improving.
My sister has long legs.
I wish I had more time to talk to you.
He speaks really well.
I took Tom's blood pressure.
Tom seems to have known the truth.
They are all innocent children.
"No matter how rich you are, you can't buy true love."
There were some muddy footprints on the floor.
"In the park, some sat on benches, and others strolled about."
That's my affair.
It was a resounding success.
A house is not a home.
I'll keep it in mind.
I'm eating breakfast.
Tom took the larger apple and gave the smaller one to Mary.
"The sooner, the better."
I didn't think you'd ever speak to me again.
My plans failed miserably.
She blushed.
Tom brought me this book.
Every door in the house is locked.
We always have to obey the rules.
Tom is very unreliable.
I'd like to go to France.
Don't you want to hear my side of the story?
Your house is fantastic.
Why thank me?
Tom finally smiled.
I locked myself out.
This job will take twice as long as I expected.
We should cancel the hike.
"Who is calling, please?"
Tom ended up in jail.
You are what you are.
I don't think I can do anything else.
What happened then?
"I have about 5,000 yen."
Mary has a pretty smile and is always very friendly.
Tom is determined to help Mary.
How do I get reimbursed?
This makes no sense to me.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Tom can't be saved.
I don't think you should quit your job.
My mother put clean sheets on the bed.
"Even though Tom and Mary didn't like each other at first, they eventually became good friends."
Tom told Mary he wasn't interested in helping her do anything.
"Tom is in the living room, watching sports on TV."
I normally don't drink coffee.
Tom didn't give you much choice.
How many guards were there?
What's the safest way to get to the top of the mountain?
I can't get up.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
You are important.
Do you really think I wouldn't help you?
Tom woke Mary up with a kiss on the cheek.
I never visit my sister.
My sight is not as good as it used to be.
Tom wasn't too pleased at the time.
"Is it OK if I don't do that? ""No, you have to do that."""
It's warm today.
We remain hopeful that Tom will recover.
This is a DVD.
Somebody must break the sad news to her mother.
How do you write your last name?
The gate is open now.
The meat was tender.
Tom is richer than I am.
Tom's French has gotten better.
You've got to see her home.
I wasn't mad at Tom.
How would you describe yourself?
"It was a pleasant day, but there were few people in the park."
This soup is really good.
Tom picked up his coffee cup and took a sip.
"He tried to solve the problem, but had no luck."
Tom wondered whether Mary would like the gift he bought her.
Cats usually hate dogs.
This painting is a forgery.
It takes two to tango.
I'm very fortunate.
Tom and Mary both know how to swim.
I find it hard to understand Tom.
Can't you help us?
"Tom was just about to go out when he got a phone call, which made him late for his meeting."
The doctor was pleased with the baby's good health.
Tom was sitting on the edge of the bed.
Tom felt that there was no need to hurry.
I was compelled to do the work alone.
Tell her that I am waiting for her.
They don't get along together.
I'll do anything that Tom asks.
I rarely talk on the phone.
I don't know about things like that.
Do you really want me to go there right now?
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
Tom put out the fire.
Summer has arrived at last.
We've searched everywhere.
I have only one picture of my grandmother.
I can't keep my coat on in this heat.
Thousands and thousands of soldiers lost their lives.
Tell me where the meeting will be held.
Don't put it that way.
We're wasting time.
Tom didn't want Mary to know he was rich.
What was stolen?
The front of Tom's shirt was stained with blood from a gunshot wound.
His salary is double what it was seven years ago.
Why are you so quick to blame Tom?
Tom's dog left muddy paw prints all over his new carpet.
I know about you and Tom.
She showed me her album.
What's going on?
I'll be very frank with you.
Tom has started to show an interest in Mary.
The manager called an urgent staff meeting.
Tom was depressed.
Tom's a great actor.
I don't want Tom to think he has to help me.
Were you there when it happened?
You may as well wait here.
The price rose.
"If I were you, I would trust her."
What I did was wrong.
"If you want to see Tom, you have to hurry."
You're not young anymore.
Were you in love with Tom?
We understand why.
The game was canceled at the last minute.
You will soon be able to speak English.
Your suggestion is of no practical use.
The door frame is warped and the door won't close properly.
Tom just sneezed.
Tom is talented.
I want you to leave us alone.
You don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
What causes stock prices to change?
My grandchildren attend this school.
I think maybe Tom is scared.
There is one apple on the desk.
I can't see why you don't want to help us.
Tom had his car stolen early last week.
He confirmed that it was the wreck of the Titanic.
I took a walk.
I passed the exam and so did Tom.
It's practically impossible not to use baby talk when talking to a young child.
Tom is a very good drummer.
"When she heard it, she got very excited."
Where's the entrance?
What a pleasant surprise!
I'm not living with him anymore.
"Doing that wouldn't be right, would it?"
Who should I address the letter to?
Show us the way.
Follow this road till you come to the river.
You're all cowards.
Tom returned from Boston yesterday.
"Last winter, I went skiing in Canada."
Your French is good enough.
He got what he wanted against all odds.

Scientists regard the discovery as important.
I figured I might find you here.
Shut up! You're talking too much.
I'm beginning to lose patience.

It won't be difficult to find somebody to do that for you.
Dolphins are really smart.
Please don't tell me to stop drinking.
Do you know what's wrong with Tom?
What does Tom want to do that for?
I'll phone you as soon as I get to the airport.
You should be ashamed of your behavior.
Tom says I'm a bad influence.
This sentence needs to be checked.
I am a realistic person.
You should've let me sing.
I found your diary.
She invited him to her party.
He's the chairman of the committee.
Did you mention my book?
I don't want to go to school.
Are you tired now?
"Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is."
They were perfect.
Tom has a grown daughter.
"Just so you know, I'm an FBI agent."
Tom looked out of the window.
It's my first time.
"You don't really mean it, do you?"
Do you shave every morning?
The girl went into the forest to look for mushrooms.
Tom doesn't plan to do that.
Tom may come tomorrow morning.
I don't know why we let you do that.
Where's my mama?
We walked about five miles.
Of course!
Thanks for saving me.
The law does not apply to this case.
Are you doing OK?
I can't even remember what Tom looks like.
That's a bad loss.
We could make it on time if we walked a little faster.
"If you're happy, I'm happy."
I only have one question.
She's in a fairly bad mood now.
"Never mind, I can do it by myself."
I want to go to a hotel.
What we need now is a rest.
Tom isn't my son.
I just spoke with Tom.
He doesn't take care of his children.
How can I deactivate my account on this site?
He did it for the good of the community.
These colors don't match well.
Tom was wrong about that.
Music is considered food for the soul.
Do you think Tom knew about that?
It wasn't until this morning that Tom told me that.
I know he is watching me.
You seem tired. You should go to bed.
You underestimate me.
Tom is good at driving.
I need a lawyer.
I found the problem uncomplicated.
"Thank you for helping me. ""Don't mention it."""
I cannot stand his arrogance any longer.
Tom cut himself.
The game has been indefinitely postponed.
I helped him carry his desk.
You have the right to the truth.
Tom was here less than an hour ago.
We ate together.
I was bitterly disappointed.
They were stuck for hours in a traffic jam.
I want to sleep.
Tom insisted on doing it.
I don't understand what you're saying.
Can I turn on the TV?
I've only used it once.
She wasn't polite to him.
"Since he was tired, he was sitting on the sofa with his eyes closed."
Tom asked Mary if she was busy.
How was the wedding?
Tom has lost his job.
I'm looking for batteries.
Japan is an island country.
He drives a Ferrari.
You're welcome to come with us if you want to.
The audience appeared bored.
Tom led the horse out of his stable.
Tom says he's almost ready to leave.
What do you think of my new hat?
The two families have very close ties.
I do not have anything in my bag.
She weeded the garden.
He went ballistic.
It's hot today.
Nobody knows why he turns down my help.
I'd say yes if I were you.
This is delicious.
Don't sign the document until you've read it.
Can we do this another time?

Tom's dad hugged him and said that he loved him.
Tom called to say he wasn't coming to work today.
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
Tom translated the French letter into English for his boss.
Tom realized that he couldn't play tennis as well as Mary.
Mary made a slight motion with her head.
My life is falling apart.
It's hard to draw a circle without a compass.
Do you know his brother?
Tom has a lot of will power.
Am I the only one?
I'm having a nice time.
I can't think of any solution to this problem.
You know things are bad when they call Tom in to help.
It was an exciting story and he told it well.
There are some exceptions.
I want to go to the city.
Seven is believed to be a lucky number.
I can't ever be with you.
Maybe you should've told Tom the truth.
I will protect you.
The whistle blew.
"After school, Tom usually sticks around as long as he can because he doesn't want to go home."
Tom didn't say much about what happened last weekend.
They talked to each other.
I'm glad you accepted my offer.
"Tom had money, a lot of it."
"Tom sat on the beach all day, writing postcards."
Tom couldn't find anyone to talk to.
Speak a little louder.
Mathematics is a difficult subject.
She suffers from a contagious disease.
We'll be fine.
Tom is the expedition leader.
Do you like this purse?
Tom and Mary are practically married.
Tom took his coat off the hanger and put it on.
"It is windy today, isn't it?"
I didn't understand any of that.
Here is the book you are looking for.
A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.
Tom and Mary are the same age.
You're starting to get the hang of it.
I'm not drinking.
We can't go back.
I guess I'd better go.
What you did was wrong.
I forgot to tell you where I live.
I went to bed early because I was tired.
How long does a butterfly live?
Tom said that he doesn't regret his decision.
I can neither confirm nor deny this.

What time do you think Tom will be back?
A gang of three robbed the bank in broad daylight.
Tom had some questions.
The jail is overcrowded.
He wants to talk to you.
Tom is looking for his wallet.
I told you that three weeks ago.
They're not here.
Tom came prepared.
Both of his parents are well.
The board unanimously decided to appoint her as CEO.
What would you change?
We can't have you working for us.
I think this is enough.
You mean a lot to me.
Why does your mother always wear sunglasses?
We're going out again.
I don't want everyone to think I'm stupid.
The dog sniffed the ground.
What's your last name?
I hope they found a cure.
They're not afraid of hard work.
Did you get anything from Tom?
"I know you probably don't want to go out with me, but I'd love to go out with you."
"It's getting cooler, particularly in the mornings and evenings."
Who is your friend?
We're on speaking terms.
We thought you knew.
You can stay here as long as you want.
My sister has very good handwriting.
He works every day but Sunday.
You should only believe about half the things Tom says.
Is it raining right now?
"Whether you believe it or not, I want to get this thing over with as much as you do."
She fell down and broke her left leg.
Thank you for the present you gave my son.
I love green peppers.
Don't make me go.
I want to show you a spectacular view.
Why are you screaming at me?
Tom put a bandage on Mary's cut.
Tom sprained his ankle two days before the trip.
You should consider moving to Boston.
Tom'll come.
Come with me.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will write back.
What language is this?
I'm on my own.
That's good news.
I have done it before.

Tom was a real hero.
Tom has a big house and three cars.
You are such a liar!

Tom didn't take his umbrella with him.
Never trust anybody.
The witch hunt has begun.
Tom couldn't find the light switch.
Is there any reason why I must obey him?
What do you need that for?
That's a fake.
The world is more dangerous than I thought.
You are always complaining about your husband.
Can you please reduce the volume of the music?
They have enough capital to build a second factory.
I eat fish every week.
Check your order.
Where did you buy flowers?
Tom stared at Mary in astonishment.
I have no idea how he escaped.
Tom was afraid that the typhoon would damage his house.
Tom was beginning to feel tired.
An ambulance arrived immediately.
Tell Tom that I'm not hungry.
I hate cold winter days.
I want to be as happy as Tom.
They weren't there.
I'm getting off at the next station.
I'm sorry for being so clumsy.
Tom is wearing gloves.
I'd love to go there one day.
Why are you so suspicious?
Tom suggested it.
I want to know what you're thinking about.
What are you guys planning?
What does your job entail?
We hold a meeting once a month.
He got used to working two hours every day in the garden.
Why should Tom visit Boston?

What are you going to have?
You can't keep something that big a secret.
I am mopping my room.
Tom handed Mary the letter opener.
Life is often compared to a voyage.

I am Hungarian.
Maybe Tom went shopping with Mary.
Tom got hit by a girl.
I just want what I was promised.
It is likely to rain soon.
I'll get her to come here.
I'll get it for you.
That's my understanding.
Just go to your room.
"Speaking of Nagoya, have you ever been to Seto?"
I'd like to know more about Tom.
Is it a weapon?
My instinct was right.
I don't want to buy that house from him.
How's your cold?
"You don't recognize me, do you?"
Didn't Tom go to Mary's house?
Explain it to me.
I lost the book you lent me.
Does Tom do that?
I have to get to Tom.

I'm expected.
Tom made a grave mistake.

What else could it be?
What Tom does is his own business.
I still have time to do that before 2:30.

What do you mean by that?

I can't dance either.
The noise doesn't bother us.
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
"I am no longer young, but I can still bite."

I know what I think.
That statistic is completely made up.
She visited him on October 20th.

I'm not very good at French.
It's easy.

What have you been up to lately?
You had better take into consideration that you are no longer young.
I can't come tomorrow.

They arrived too soon.
The majority of those men worked in the mine.
You are not welcome in my home anymore.
"It's a little late for that, isn't it?"
Have you been to Kyoto?
When Mary finds out about it she'll throw a fit.

"Fortunately, Tom didn't get seriously hurt."
The matter is all settled.
I'd like to get to know you better.

Tom is busy right now and he can't help you.
I saw him in the park.
"Here, this one's yours."
She's a night owl.
Turn left at the second traffic light.
Could you please repeat it slowly?
He jumped to his feet the moment he heard the news.
I'm not good at speaking English yet.
It serves you right.
Don't put it on my desk.
Five times seven is thirty-five.
Thanks for this.
I like to come here.
This desk is broken.
That's a trivial error.
Do you shave every morning?
He did it for the money.
Is that a bear?

Have you ever had anything custom made?

I believe that I can trust you.
You don't need to worry about that kind of thing anymore.

The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one.
Do you have a steady girlfriend?
"If you stand over in that corner, Tom won't likely even notice you're here."
Why did you and Tom break up?
He yearned for her to come home.
I had nothing else to do.
"Tom didn't succeed, but it wasn't for want of trying."
"You alone can do it, but you can't do it alone."
Tom has remarried.
We're having a party next Saturday.
He's getting cold feet.
My father used to say that money is not everything.
I am looking forward to hearing from him.
I expect him to come.
Tom said that he was too busy to eat.
Someone is at the front door. Go and see who it is.
I can teach you how to sing.
I hope no one sees us.
Father bought me a model plane.
She begged for something to drink.
"If time permits, I'll visit the museum."
Don't worry. I'll teach you how to drive.
"We're safe now, aren't we?"
Nobody slept.
How do I explain it?
I wasn't the only one who was there.
Tom doesn't like mathematics.
I was watching TV then.
She solved the problem with ease.
I can't afford a new car this year.
Tom didn't see anything.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
That ship has sailed.
His opinion doesn't count.
"In spite of the storm, he went out."
I don't want to take care of a dog.
We had no drinking water.
All three of you need to do that.
I know his family.
The general gave the order to retreat.
Tom has a broken arm.
Tom is more intelligent and sophisticated than most boys his age.
"For a refund, you must return the item unopened."
Do you want me to drive you home?
His opinions carry weight.
Tom has a light complexion.
The bus is behind time.
How're they doing that?
This company sold unsafe products.
"When his wife heard of his violent death, she was beside herself with grief."
I hope the fog will go away soon.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't be able to earn more than thirty dollars an hour.
Please let me know.
We succeeded.
You must be at least 17 years old to donate blood.
Do you have a map?
We need more trade agreements.
"She looks young, but as a matter of fact she is older than you are."
Tom fell and scraped his knee.
The author is Brazilian.
He's in big trouble.
"The couple quarreled, but soon made up."
We had high hopes for Tom.
What comes next?
Tom doesn't know where he is.
You can use my car if you drive carefully.
What car did he take?
"You're clever, but not clever enough."
The movie was so sad that everybody cried.
"Give that to me, please."
He comes here once a month.
I detest Tom.
Tell me what I should've done.
The transportation system in that city is quite good.
Did you lose your car keys?
Tom says he already knows how to do that.
Where did you go for your honeymoon?
Dust had accumulated on the desk.
You don't sound convinced.
Tom is a chauffeur.
You've got a fever.
Tom screamed like a woman.
I have been here for two years.
Please don't touch this.
His behavior alienated his friends.
Do you want to go with us?
"Recently I have been feeling a little tired, so I have not gone swimming this week."
Just think what we could do with that much money.
We don't have a single thing to worry about.
Practice is the only way to master foreign languages.
Tom recognized Mary as soon as he saw her.
Tom hit the nail on the head when he said our team lacks enthusiasm and motivation.
She stared at him and that made him very nervous.
Do you have one that's cheaper?
You should start as early as possible.
We never work on Sunday.
How did the exam go?
Why aren't you with me?
Tom is winning.
I recommend you to go by train.
The dog must be hungry.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
The exhibition is now open.
Tom asked Mary and her friends for help.
Tom didn't read the newspaper yesterday.
My problem is I'm too busy.
God is our strength.
Can you help me?
What are you getting at?
Tom has lots of things to tell Mary.
I wouldn't mind helping Tom.
"I tried again and again, but I couldn't succeed."
What're you doing there?
Tom said it was cold in Boston this time of year.
It was foolish of him to waste his money on such trifles.
I don't think married people should have secrets from each other.
Tom asked Mary if she was really happy with her new job.
I don't believe him at all.
My jeans shrank in the wash.
They are in favor of your plan.
What's the official language of Tunisia?
I like to do that.
It's a very strange case.
It isn't your decision.
Is the dog chained?
Tom is a smoker.
Are you angry at me?
How do you like my new wall calendar?
Don't expect too much.
Tom almost fainted.
How can Tom not understand that?
"Where have you been, Tom?"
What are you two doing?
Tom isn't sure what the rules are.
I wish I could come with you.
What do you want to study at college?
It's going to stay that way.
Don't forget anything.
Let's do this another time.
Many people are against the bill.
I went with them so that I could guide them around Nagasaki.
You cannot be serious.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tom said that he thought Mary's suggestion was good.
I was right behind Tom.
One king after another succeeded to the throne during those few years.
Tom didn't have anything to say.
What else is there to say?
Get on with it.
That's not for Tom.
Beware of pickpockets.
What a big house you have!
Tom was strong.
I began driving our tractor when I was 12 years old to help my father out at harvest time.
I'd like to go out with you.
I read his book.
"I don't love her, not even if she loves me."
My brother went to Italy.
Tom couldn't sleep because he had a bad headache.
Tomorrow is my day off.
Do you remember what you were watching?
How's Tom's cold?
Don't let me die.
He's crying.
He wants to meet you.
"Unfortunately, the food supplies gave out before the end of winter."
It isn't obvious.
I'm learning Chinese.
He doesn't have enough money to travel.
"A tea with lemon, please."
Tom said it was a problem.
Millions of people across the world are mourning the death of Nelson Mandela.
Who's the fastest one here?
She was the last person I expected to see in such a place.
You should spend less time complaining and more time doing something productive.
He majors in modern literature.
"Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library."
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
Don't try to make me angry.
What is written in the book?
Let's pretend this never happened.
Tom hugged Mary.
I don't like pizza anymore.
Do you know Tom's phone number?
It was about twenty dollars.
She forced him to do it.
Tom told Mary he thought she was stupid.
How do you like Texas so far?
I never liked that one anyway.
She was burning with anger.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
I'm fed up with English.
I asked Tom where he had gone to school.
Tom is amazing.
Tom isn't a rich man.
Tom loves being outdoors.
Tom takes the trash out every day at six o'clock.
She looked sad.
Can you teach me French?
Make a prediction.
She surprised him with a small gift.
I like to answer this kind of question.
Tom was a little disappointed.
Tom said it was your fault.
I lied to protect you.
Nobody but Tom agreed with me.
Don't you like it?
What did Tom want us to do?
He made friends with Tom.
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
They were members of the middle class.
I read a lot of novels.
I'm studying very hard.
You must accept the king of Spain as your leader.
Tom is jumping rope.
"Hey, look what I can do!"
This machine is driven by electricity.
Thanks for coming.
Your idea differs entirely from mine.
Will you accompany me?
Tom sounds mad.
I know you meant well.
Have I told you this joke before?
I should be able to do that.
That's uncalled for.
He behaved like a child.
I don't understand what you're doing.
We are sorry we can't help you.
There's a chance he won't play on Friday.
I loved it in Boston.
Tom's parents are John and Mary.
Optimists see opportunities in disasters while pessimists find disasters in every opportunity.
It makes my mouth water.
It probably doesn't matter what we do.
"If you make your own clothes, it will save you money."
I'm waiting for her to come here.
Show me how it works.
I think you're going to do great.
"That's a fake beard, isn't it?"
"He gave me 10,000 yen."
You are not at all what I expected.
Don't give it to anyone.
"Don't worry! Even if I drink, it doesn't have an effect on my driving."
The bear is quite tame and doesn't bite.
Tom was with me in my apartment at the time Mary was murdered.
You'll understand it later on.
I haven't talked to Tom.
We'd better call the police.
The good news is that we don't have to go.
I think we should change the topic.
I want you to want me.
I'll wait for you downstairs.
Gestures are very important in human communication.
Do you promise not to tell anyone anything?
All the phones were ringing.
It was my turn.
I hope to become a singer.
I wonder what Tom is doing.
"If I'd wanted your opinion, I'd have asked for it."
He took out his handkerchief.
I was taken advantage of.
I'll take the responsibility on my shoulders.
Many high-level officials attended the meeting.
Tom hates dancing.
What a lovely day it is!
I would appreciate a reply.
The queen shook hands with each player after the game.
She told her son to wait a minute.
Are you hiding something from me?
You're vain.
Are you sure about this?
I brought some of my books to read.
"Tom described Mary quite well, so it was easy to recognize her when I saw her."
Tom came to Boston in 2001 and lived here until 2010.
I hope you are not catching a cold.
There are many bad people in the world.
I can never tell the two of them apart.
Two young men have been killed by tiger sharks on Australian beaches in the past two weeks.
Don't you miss anything?
Tom pretended that he was a doctor.
I'm dining out this evening.
I got it.
Tom knows wines.
She has been studying French for a few years.
You are absolutely correct.
Tom gained weight.
The milk boiled over.
I discovered too late that I left out the most important part of my speech.
This horse kicks when anyone comes up from behind.
"You know Tom, don't you?"
I told you to stop calling me that.
Everybody knows for a fact that he is still alive.
I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered.
Tom doesn't want Mary to do that.
Have you paid the bill yet?
Have a nice summer vacation.
I'd like to meet Tom sometime.
Get away from here.
The food wasn't that great.
I remember the house where I grew up.
I could barely speak French three years ago.
The dog followed him wherever he went.
We're leaving.
Tom tried to understand why he was different from other people.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
They consider him their best employee.
Thank you for drawing a bird for me.
Tom might still be living in Australia.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
Who hired you?
Tom promised to take me away from here.
He doesn't speak my language.
Only four horses competed in the race.
Tom says he wants to go to Boston.
Where's his home?
I have a sweet-tooth.
Either you or I will have to do it.
Perhaps you're right.
Tom won't admit that he's done anything wrong.
Tom is an old man who always has beautiful young women around him who admire him.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Tom can be a little difficult to get along with.
The wall wasn't high enough to keep dogs out.
Do you know how to drive?
Could you pass me the salt?
Tom will never love you.
I hope that doesn't happen.
He doesn't realize that he doesn't have time for these things.
Tom was absolutely sure of himself.
There may be another way to do this.
This is where the accident happened.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
Tom lives by himself in the woods.
I've got nowhere to go.
I should go to Boston.
You know I have to go.
Do you want to know his name?
I wish I were a prince.
Tom did it on purpose.
Please bring us two cups of tea and one cup of coffee.
I wondered whether Tom wanted to dance.
I'm here to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life.
Everybody knows the news.
"Tom will probably be late. ""Yes, that's a possibility."""
How long have you been stationed here?
She made me a cake.
Tom went fishing.
This extension cord is too short.
I think Tom is courageous.
How often do you feed the fish?
We helped one another.
I'm a late riser.
I'd like to show this picture of Tom to you.
I can't find any evidence to support your accusation.
I never win any arguments.
Who are all these people?
It doesn't matter what I do.
Tom's house is only three blocks away from here.
What's your analysis?
I don't know her.
You have to start somewhere.
That's what made me happy.
Tom attended high school for three years without missing a single day or ever being late.
"Where have you been? ""I've been to the barber's."""
Mary rummaged through her purse.
This building is about three hundred years old.
I only know what Tom told me.
"Your uncle took these pictures, didn't he?"
Tom gave his dog a bone.
Why didn't you call me last night?
The lovers exchanged numerous letters.
He told us a very exciting adventure story.
This is a happy occasion.
I'm exaggerating.
Tom is dejected.
Good night and sweet dreams.
Who wears the pants in your family?
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
I was very busy yesterday.
I don't like the way he looks at you.
Tom lacks confidence in himself.
I think that you're right.
Who found you?
He made up the whole story.
Tom and Mary are still watching TV.
Tom entered the abandoned house.
Did you really eat everything?
He burned the croutons.
Why don't you ask Tom to help you wash the car?
Watch out! This monkey is vicious.
Tell me that we haven't failed.
Those animals were in danger of dying out.
She need not have brought a lunch.
They went on talking all night.
Tom gasped.
I couldn't just sit there and do nothing.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Tom said that he didn't know why Mary had to do that.
Who gave this to you?
Don't be late for the train.
Tom said he felt threatened.
This coat does not fit me any more.
What do you think I should wear on my date tomorrow?
Did I ask your opinion?
It's a bit greasy.
A stranger approached him.
It's one of our rules.
I'm almost finished reading this book.
She likes short skirts.
Tom gave me a box of chocolates.
He told his son an interesting story.
Have you ever been in Boston before?
This has nothing to do with you.
Lincoln was assassinated in 1865.
Forty-eight sailors are on board.
Can I ask you something very personal?
You can use the hotel's swimming pool.
I was unable to finish my homework.
Who's winning?
Tom has written three books.
"Actually, I've never seen one."
He isn't richer than me.
I spoke to the actress herself.
Tom told everyone that Mary knew how to do that.
Everything is all right now.
It's not worth the pain.
Tom lost his house key.
This banana is green.
Did you watch TV yesterday?
Don't come in my room without knocking.
We both fell asleep.
Tom did what he promised me he'd do.
It was almost too easy.
Tom eats like a horse.
We met her by accident.
The auction is over.
I think I'm ready.
Where can we meet you?
The house is painted white.
Tom is upstairs.
"Help me, please."
What do you say to taking a walk in the park?
Your students don't like me.
It's already eleven.
Please listen carefully to what I have to say.
Do you think I'm crazy?
The doctor advised that she stay at home.
It's you who are confused.
Do you still enjoy watching cartoons?
Where should I put the tray?
The report cannot be true.
The dog needs water.
Take the next bus.
Tom fastened his seatbelt.
That's to be expected.
I don't make the rules. I just follow them.
I'll call back soon.
Why are you crying?
The wounded man recovered in three days.
Mary insulted the waiter.
I read a book.
This is a good question.
Cheer up! Things are not as bad as you think.
He came out on top.
I'm very busy these days.
He lives in an enormous house.
Isn't that obvious to everyone?
I'm thinking as fast as I can.
Do you really live alone?
Tom shut down his computer.
Say hello to your sister for me.
The problem is being discussed by them.
I can't drink milk.
We bound him to secrecy.
He was watching television all day.
Don't make any noise or you'll scare the birds away.
I'd rather go to Boston.
She seems to be sick.
"The banker's pay cut was temporary, not permanent."
Tom doesn't know where he should go.
The call is free of charge.
"Tom walked into the kitchen, carrying a bag of groceries."
I've decided to make something for us to eat.
Tom's face is red.
I parked my car by the gate.
I want to do this.
What is it you want most?
Maybe I'll just give up soon and take a nap instead.
You didn't need to do that.
You probably know more about me than I know about you.
You shouldn't have let everyone know how angry you were.
I haven't formed an opinion yet.
Tom hasn't finished all his homework yet.
A serious epidemic has broken out in Beijing.
We study French at school every day.
What are your names?
Tom's packing.
I'm going to take a bath.
We went along a narrow road.
He looks young.
Is her father a teacher?
I couldn't breathe.
He excels in many sports.
They're murderers.
There was a rapid decline in stock prices.
Tom is currently working on that problem.
They all looked for the lost child.
We don't have to do this.
Is Tom going to be here?
I thought Tom was going to do that.
Tom doesn't know the difference between right and wrong.
Don't leave everything to chance.
Do you have the tickets?
He didn't return until it was already too late.
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
Do you think you know me?
Your birthday is coming soon.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Tom came to my house yesterday.
He has a lot more money than I have.
You can't leave yet.
We met earlier.
Keep driving.
How many more days are there until Christmas?
I'm going to need more help.
What an interesting book!
Please put the table next to the wall.
Tom stood up and walked to the window.
Balls are round.
We need some privacy.
Didn't I say that?
Students arriving late will not be permitted to enter the hall.
Does Tom suspect anything?
Did they go to museum by bus?
I've got to speak to you.
Paris is one of the largest cities in the world.
Tom has a learning disorder.
We'll talk about that soon.
Tom is talking in his sleep again.
Tom asked Mary to wait for him here.
Liquor is not sold at this store.
Do you like singing?
What do you want to give Tom for his birthday?
She can't have said so.
How do you like this town?
Do you think I haven't anticipated that?
It was impossible to come up with a really satisfactory solution.
"Stop, or I'll shoot."
Please get in touch with me when you come to Tokyo.
Tom was sitting at his desk.
He is playing music.
"Tom got a new job. ""What kind of job?"""
I couldn't have done it alone.
I don't think of it like that.
Where is the nearest store?
How many eggs were you able to get yesterday?
Everybody saw it.
Would you like me to carry your suitcase for you?
"The date on the calendar was September 23, 1964."
He likes music very much.
This film is worth seeing.
Your shoulders are very tense.
Tom has a bald spot.
He isn't afraid of death.
I caught a beautiful butterfly.
That's not yours.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
I went to the bank.
Buy six meters of that cloth.
I visited my father's grave.
He has no more strength.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
The police officer checked to see if the body lying on the ground had a pulse.
Tom is my stepfather.
Is there a cat on the table?
You may go anywhere.
It begins at six-thirty.
I'm Tom's assistant.
I wish I were dead.
The baby was quiet all night.
I've already said I don't know how to do it.
You have to stay in bed until next Monday.
I assure you that won't be necessary.
Tom wore a hard hat.
He's never told a lie.
We bought some tennis balls.
I hope you know that the last thing I want to do is go there without your permission.
We don't need your help.
I assure you that won't be necessary.
The Japanese take off their shoes when entering a house.
Tom spent all afternoon cleaning his room.
Who do you talk to?
Tell me what to do.
Tom danced with Mary.
I'm not sure how to pronounce the word.
Would you like for me to do that for you?
I got my son to cook supper.
You won’t believe what happened next.
The house is in need of repair.
You almost killed me.
Tom drove Mary's car to Boston.
Tom thanked Mary for the present.
Did you buy Tom a dog?
Is everything satisfactory?
Tom can't bear to look at Mary.
Tom never wears a hat.
I never knew my father.
Tom's not in.
I'm going to Tom's on Monday.
I have no clue what you're talking about.
He passed away quite suddenly.
What's the name of your dog?
"You aren't in a hurry, are you?"
Three beers and a tequila please.
I'll show you around the city.
Tom said that he thought that he should learn how to do that.
This is a work in progress.
You did the right thing.
Tom complained that he didn't have enough time to read.
When did you last talk to Tom?
This is a good place to build a house.
Which one of you is the oldest?
The news filled her with sorrow.
Wires transmit electricity.
How many times do I have to explain this to you?
Tom says he did not mean to kill her.
Tom glanced back.
I didn't know Tom was married.
"His debts amount to 100,000 yen."
His behavior is worthy of respect.
I don't want to buy this carpet.
What are you doing back there?
Please relax.
What's your favorite junk food?
I can't do this to Tom.
I sat by his side.
The teacher told Tom to shut up.
Who was your French teacher?
It's a lot of work.
I provided him with food.
I'll update it soon.
I have a pain in my foot.
Can you tell us about it?
Mary wants to get her belly button pierced.
It's the logical thing to do.
I didn't understand the question.
It looks like you've got a green thumb.
Tom needs medical attention immediately.
Tom is vain.
It stopped snowing an hour ago.
"You still need more sleep, don't you?"
I think you are mistaken.
The paper didn't carry the story.
I can't make that kind of promise.
The price is up to you.
A new oil tanker was launched.
Can we come?
Why don't you leave them alone?
Will you take a check?
"Tom is sitting on the sofa, reading a magazine."
It is easy to distinguish good from evil.
I'll ask Tom to teach me how to drive.
Mary knitted a sweater for Tom.
It looks like Tom is flirting with Mary.
Tom found Mary fascinating.
I barely ever talk to Tom.
Everett spoke for almost two hours.
I would really like to know why he did such a thing.
Try pushing the other button.
Where does Tom have to do that?
"Could you move over a little? ""Oh, sorry. I didn't realize I was taking up so much space."""
You recovered quickly.
I'm very scared.
Tom asked Mary why she didn't want to go to Australia with John.
Everyone is entitled to his own opinion.
You're not as good as you think you are.
Does that about do it?
We chopped our way through the jungle.
Do you know Tom's father's name?
This never would've happened if you'd done it the way I told you to do it.
"If it wasn't for modern medicine, I'd be dead right now."
A person's heart is approximately the same size as their fist.

Are you really sick?
Equality is guaranteed by the Constitution.
The Tomei Expressway connects Tokyo with Nagoya.
The policeman blamed the taxi driver for the accident.
Whose car is that?

He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
Why did you listen to him?

"Some people like cats, and others prefer dogs."
It will soon be dark.
She dressed like a boy.
Don't be so lazy.
Tom put the rifle away.
"I'm sorry, Tom, I can't do that."
I chopped a tree down.
It's snowing here.
When will you come back?
There's too much I don't know.
I'll take care of the dog while you are out.
How long is the Rainbow Bridge?
This is the murder weapon.
Are you sure of that?
Tom isn't eating.
It looks like Tom has given up.
"Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary wouldn't let him."
How shall I put it?
Tom cheats.
How long is the ticket good for?
I like Tom's voice.
We caught the thief.
Tom didn't understand my French.
He sat on the bench.
I'm a bit hungry.
We might as well wait until Tom gets here.
Never leave your drink unattended.
I want a new dress.
Do you like music?
We hope to meet you again.
I will not let you do it.
Tom is focused.
Tom carried two boxes into the storage room.
I don't regret quitting my job.
It's about to explode!
Please tell me the way to the post office.
You're fired.
I love the way you say my name.
Tom is my student.
Tom doesn't live in the city.
We plan to go hiking tomorrow.
"Be quick, or you will miss the train."
The soldiers narrowly escaped death.
Tom might go to the zoo with Mary this coming Saturday.
For breakfast I have two slices of toast with marmalade and black tea.
I no longer need it.
Tom seems distressed.
We weren't told where he came from.
Let go of me!
"If you want more details about that, you'll have to ask my boss."
Do you want to risk that?
Tom will start.
It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
Tom isn't going to like this.
She stands a good chance of winning the prize.
Tom isn't doing that because he doesn't think he needs to.
Tom is drinking champagne.
These scissors are suitable for left and right-handed people.
Did you arrest Tom?
I turned on the fan.
No one wants to fail. Everyone wants to succeed.
I don't really know.
The new highway shaves almost an hour off my commute time.
We can't let Tom walk. Let's give him a ride.
I was in a bad mood.
I'll give Tom half of my share.
Forty-eight sailors are on the ship.
Do you like tofu?
Tom often cuts classes.
Tom filled out the application for me.
I'm really confused.
I'm serious.
Tom is doing a fine job.
He had to pay the damages.
Tom is a shrewd businessman.
I just hope nothing goes wrong this time.
Tom has to learn to relax.
They saluted each other by raising their hats.
Your o's look like a's.
You don't keep your promises.
I'm asking you to reconsider.
I can't open this bottle.
Do you have to do that?
I got it for free.
I didn't know the answer.
The text needs to be translated into Belarusian.
I think Tom looks a lot like John.
"Plutonium-239 has a half-life of 24,100 years."
I know you're listening.
I lost my patience.
"Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year."
Whether he wrote the novel or not is not known.
I cannot trust a person like that.
It seems that Tom had planned to give Mary the loan she had been looking for.
Tom does have to do that.
Are you really interested in that?
Do you have any evidence to prove him guilty?
The boy was tired.
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
He and I are cousins.
I heard Tom's voice.
Tom wrote down his phone number.
"You're not rich, are you?"
"You're very brave, aren't you?"
You have the freedom to travel wherever you like.
"If you want to study in the United States, you need to get a student visa."
I stayed at my uncle's during the summer.
I'm anxious to meet her.
Isn't that your dictionary?
Please say hello to your parents for me.
The only time he feeds the dog is when his wife is away on a trip.
He dedicated his whole life to helping poor people.
May God have mercy on us all.
Where is the cat?
I have to prioritize.
No one could see us.
Tom is quite crazy.
I followed him.
I can teach you how to cook.
I still have difficulty in making myself understood in French.
Give me some time to think it over.
I was unable to stand any longer.
I thought you said it was yours.
She is busy at present and can't speak to you.
Do you always watch TV in the evening?
Leave me alone and let me do my job.
Please spare my life.
Those trains run every three minutes.
Minutes of the previous meeting were accepted.
He was granted admission to the university.
Tom threw a pie in Mary's face.
Tom never paid me.
Start the car.
Tom bought a rose and gave it to Mary.
These gloves kept her hands warm.
The doctor said he was more concerned about Tom's ankle than his broken finger.
Can you open it?
I'm really looking forward to spending time with Tom.
Try to look ahead.
He ratted us out.
Tom can't find the right words to describe his feelings for Mary.
Tom just needs a little time to get used to the idea that Mary will now be his stepsister.
I'm tired. It's been a long day.
We paid a heavy price for this victory.
I asked Mary to dance with me.
"If you wash it, your car will shine in the sun."
They followed Tom.
We won't need your help today.
Their talks centered on their trip.
The curtain fell.
"He answered my question with a ""no."""
Do you have any proof?
Keep an eye on the kids.
I can't remember where I first met Tom.
Tom lacks experience.
My uncle runs a hotel.
Shall we walk or take the bus?
He's two years older than I am.
He is a perfectionist.
Tom accidentally dropped an egg on the floor.
I've always hated you.
They whispered to each other.
I see that you've found your umbrella.
Who brought this?
I remember everything.
Why are leaves green?
She complained to him about everything.
It's junk. Throw it away.
I asked where Tom was.
She had a clear conscience.
It would be better for you to stay away from such a man.
They avoided each other for days.
I'm from Australia.
I want you to understand this.
You should treat people with more respect.
Can you pass me the milk?
Thank you for setting the record straight.
I hope everything's going well with you.
This is the TV station where my uncle works as an announcer.
Tom has three older brothers.
I think you look fine.
Tom and Mary don't have the time or the money to take a trip.
Tom eventually found a job that he liked.
The cold weather continued for three weeks.
I want to get out of here.
It is about time you went to school.
"You think I did it, don't you?"
You sound surprised.
Notice how the player uses his elbows.
That was a good steak.
Tom is in bad shape these days.
I wonder why nobody told me.
Give me my money.
He suggested I go with him to the party.
I don't want to see Tom do that.
You must study grammar more.
May I put it down here?
Let's get some lunch.
You still have much to learn.
My mother is out.
Which of the two is more expensive?
The missing cat has not been found yet.
What is the name of that bird?
His parents were farmers.
You don't seem to be enjoying yourself.
I didn't do anything illegal.
The library is in the center of the city.
"If you don't like the service, don't leave a tip."
I didn't think you'd believe me.
He really likes music a lot.
Tom turned around suddenly.
Speaking foreign languages is not easy.
Try this on.
I want to buy a new camera.
Tom is out.
"Where's your cousin? ""She's just left."""
A crowd of people gathered to see the parade.
What's the price of this umbrella?
What are you going to be in the future?
The refugees were excluded from the country.
He complained that the soup was too hot.
Tom died after his car hit a tree.
"If you keep breaking the club rules, you'll get thrown out."
Tom spent the better part of the day writing an article for a local magazine.
It seems that she is not pleased with the job.
Tom is seldom late for appointments.
The meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
I wish I could make up for lost time.
We know each other quite well.
I'm already on it.
The treatment appears to be working.
Have you finished reading the book?
I can recommend a good hotel.
Feel free to contact me.
"If my mother had still been alive, she would have helped me at that time."
You could've saved me a trip if you'd just told me I didn't need to be here today.
Tell me why she is crying.
Didn't he tell you who he was?
He is capable of teaching French.
Tom is deeply grateful for all Mary's help.
It is very hot today.
The compass points to the north.
Tom had a couple of new suits made.
Tom closed the door of his bedroom.
I don't really care who wins.
You know where Tom is.
What do you find so interesting about squirrels?
Don't say anything!
Let's talk about this later.
These photos have come out very well.
Tom was fatter three years ago than he is now.
That's a blue house.
I can carry that for you.
I'm the oldest.
Tom lost seventy pounds.
Tom has been in prison for a long time.
Tom wakes up at six-thirty every morning.
A lot of children don't hear the difference very well.
My life would be completely empty without you.
Tom's knee hurts when he walks up or down stairs.
I have a Vietnamese friend. Her name is Tiên.
Tell me what the rules are.
Tom has more money in the bank than I do.
You are now on the way to recovery.
We've got to be ready for that.
It was your idea.
He took part in the Olympic Games.
I can hardly understand you.
Tom likes to play in the dirt.
He came down the hill on his bicycle.
I studied English for two hours after dinner.
I like the blue one. How much does it cost?
Do you really not know?
"Where are Tom and Mary? ""They're on their way."""
I don't know anything about her.
Mary bought a present for her friend's daughter.
Tom tends to be lazy.
"If I were you, I'd follow his advice."
I'm an honest person.
I'll be home by 2:30.
"If you're happy, I'm glad."
"The sky grew darker and darker, and the wind blew harder and harder."
That's not funny.
Toudaiji is the bigger of the two temples.
It's totally dark outside.
It's about time I was going home.
You have no right to say so.
I saw the sunrise.
Tom needs to get some sleep.
We have the same group of friends.
Thousands lost their homes.
Can you throw a fastball?
I'm not sure that's all true.
She accused me of stealing her money.
English is spoken in Canada.
We could see the lights of the town in the distance.
I sure hope you're right.
What are you called?
Tom is impossible to beat.
No comment.
"You woke up early this morning, didn't you?"
What's going on with children these days?
It's not a good idea to pick up hitchhikers.
Tom says that he believes everything I say.
I tried everything.
I'm not going to waste time.
Have a safe trip.
Tom still writes to me from time to time.
Do you have beer?
My right leg hurts.
What do you want this for?
Tom asked Mary not to leave.
You have to stay awake.
Tom received a call from Mary.
I've got no friends.
May I sit down?
He described his own experience.
Tom dried his hands.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing here?
I only know a few words.
Do you need more time?
He does not seem to be able to catch on to what she is saying.
They are a peace-loving people.
Tom earns twice as much as me.
They're wonderful.
Tom spoke louder than usual.
Tom doesn't appreciate what Mary did.
I want something to write on.
Do you have enough money?
I demand a refund.
Tom watches the 6 o'clock news every evening.
Mary didn't want Tom to stop kissing her.
"Whose chair is this? ""It is mine."""
You were the one who suggested it.
The cat nuzzled against Tom.
I knew Tom would be thirsty.
The breakfast dishes were still in the sink.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
What is it you're afraid of?
Tom wore jeans and a cowboy hat.
Everyone makes mistakes.
Tom is very picky about what he eats.
Tom bought a present for his son.
Do you understand her?
He is past forty.
It took a moment for Tom to find his voice.
How do you handle stress?
We are going to leave tomorrow.
Tom often plays the guitar.
You're worrying too much.
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
This is the least interesting.
She had to accept her fate.
Tom listened to what Mary was saying.
I think you should apologize to Tom.
Do you have a vacancy?
Mary's mother took a liking to Tom the moment she met him.
It's best not to ask.
We don't have that long.
Tom is faster than you think.
Who do we owe money to?
Are you guys crazy?
Tom is coming back.
I found a bird whose wing was severely damaged.
The reason for this is plain.
Tom wanted my permission.
Do you think that handguns should be made illegal?
Tom must've had some reason for doing what he did.
What was it we were talking about?
Tom doesn't need to know who gave this to us.
"I don't know when Tom called, but it was either yesterday or the day before."
I want political asylum.
Germany was allied with Italy in World War II.
Tom pointed his finger at Mary.
Tom suddenly appeared.
How many times do I have to explain this to you?
Does that feel good?
It is too expensive for me to buy.
Bring that here.
This is why I want Tom to go.
Tom didn't like Mary's parents.
This stopper does not fit the bottle.
I bolted the door.
What happened?
I don't know when my mother will come back.
Tom is a hard person to please.
I want you to help me clean it up.
Tom could have paid for Mary's ticket if he'd known she didn't have enough money.
I don't like that.
I didn't have a chance.
I can't find the restaurant.
I thought we had settled this.
Don't underestimate it.
Don't make me go.
Tom shouldn't have said such a thing.
Tom is saying goodbye to Mary.
There was gunshot residue on Tom's jacket.
Tom locked all the doors.
The town was destroyed during the war.
My bike has been stolen.
I don't want to believe that.
"People like me, but they don't love me."
I'm not going to ask again.
What's your favorite time waster?
What's the matter with you?
"You're not very hungry, are you?"
You are a good cook.
I thought you said you didn't want to be disturbed.
Tom was stoned.
I look forward to your next visit.
People are dying.
It's difficult for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
I'm amazed at his nerve.
Do you still feel something for me?
I have a magazine in my room.
Tom was John's roommate.
Why is life so full of suffering?
"I hope you know that, Tom."
Good night and sweet dreams.
You and I are good friends.
Which browser are you using?
How do you know it won't happen again?
Money isn't everything.
I wouldn't dream of selling my guitar.
"Tom seldom, if ever, laughs."
No one forced me to do that.
I must learn this poem by heart.
The children washed their feet.
"In fact, he even loved her."
They're doing OK.
I was hoping you'd come back.
That wasn't funny.
Tom helps anybody who asks him for help.
She looked at me and smiled.
Who's on watch?
My horse is black.
I think you are mistaken.
I forgot my account number.
How many pencils do you have?
Break it down.
Do you think Tom is OK?
I am the same age.
Do you actually feel sorry for Tom?
Tom didn't seem all that surprised.
"If you don't want it, I'll eat it."
We're not leaving you here.
I wonder if it really was a coincidence.
Why are you in my house?
How much was it?
I bet I get there before you.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I know you aren't that stupid.
Tom saw a doctor.
"I, too, am worried about Tom."
How clever!
I wish you didn't hang out with Tom. I don't like him.
She passed by without glancing at me.
I'm a shutterbug.
"Here you are, Tom."
That's impossible.
I haven't seen much of Tom recently.
She was wearing a men's shirt which did not fit her.
"If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay at home."
She committed a crime.
He had just come home when I called.
I'll be there at two o'clock without fail.
Please tell me you're OK.
I wonder if Tom really meant what he said.
He is too much of a coward to attempt it.
Tom always washes his hands before eating anything.
"Pass me the ketchup, please."
I am already accustomed to sitting on tatami.
We're running out of supplies.
What's your new telephone number?
I'll let you know later.
"Run, or else you'll be late."
May I see your invitation please?
I'm just going to run down to buy some tickets.
You are the one.
Plants need water and sunlight.
"It's so bad, it's funny."
A lot of people don't vote.
Stop looking at me.
I must get there by 9 o'clock.
Why did Tom stop working here?
Nobody wants to talk about that.
Do you want to know his name?
You should think about your future.
"You're going to wait, right?"
He thinks he can prove it.
Do you like being famous?
The days are getting longer.
This is how I mastered English.
I've missed out on so much.
He devoured his meal.
Why would anybody want to kill you?
I've been burgled three times this month.
Tom will drive you home.
You can't park in front of my house on weekends.
I hope you caught more fish than I did.
Let's see what we can find out.
Go away!
What's your favorite Christmas movie?
I hate coffee.
Many people were there.
Have you ever been to France?
Tom doesn't speak much French.
Tom said you like popcorn.
Tom is getting better.
Stay here with Tom.
You do have a point.
How do you know what you should do?
Will you please stick a 60-yen stamp on the envelope?
Tom is taller than Mary.
Tom is quite reserved.
We put up the flags on national holidays.
I wonder what happened to ancient Rome.
I knew nobody would believe me.
Stand up when I'm talking to you!
"If you don't want to go, you don't need to."
She is a runner.
I liked your comment.
I don't like being treated like this.
Don't make a mistake.
The moon doesn't have an atmosphere.
That's all we know for sure.
I've come to get you.
Iceland used to belong to Denmark.
He lived in Ankara for six years.
I can teach you my language.
Don't tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend.
They asked about the others.
Tom wanted his son to live in Boston.
I think you'd better lie low until she forgives you.
I like it when Tom does that.
Is Tom good at cooking?
This new song is a big hit.
He joined the opposing team.
When do you usually go to bed?
Can you tell me when Tom got his driver's license?
He is playing here.
The juggler wowed the crowd by keeping ten oranges up in the air.
He has a lot of books on history.
How could it be?
I was about to go to bed when he called me up.
He was admitted to the school.
He makes it a rule to get up at six every day.
Please think about the problem.
Tom kicked the trash can.
Did you stop at the red light?
I want to thank you again for believing me.
The meeting begins at three.
We want to know if it will be sunny tomorrow.
Tom seemed biased.
Do you know this part of the city very well?
I don't know whether it's going to work.
It's very warm. Shall I turn on the air conditioner?
Little children like to touch everything.
Not every bird can sing.
The call was traceable to an address in south Detroit.
You and I are the same age.
The Tsubasa is a very fast train.
What I want to know is how Tom got here.
I've fallen in love with somebody else.
I have no one to confide in.
I can neither confirm nor deny that.
The cats are afraid of water.
You have to stop this.
She agreed with him.
I don't care who Tom kisses.
I have back problems.
I fell in love with a girl from Vienna.
Did Tom say something?
Could you do that tomorrow?
Why are you doing this?
I am ashamed of my son's laziness.
He's feeling much better.
The paper didn't carry the story.
I don't do things like that.
Can you introduce me to a doctor who speaks French?
Don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam.
Lead bends easily.
My answer is final.
Tom usually goes to bed before midnight.
How many years have you two been married?
She put her head out of the window.
That is the duty of the police.
What am I doing here?
We laughed about it.
It's dangerous out there.
Is that a request or an order?
Please don't ask.
It's too hot.
The bathroom window is open.
I'm on campus at the moment.
Are you a good dancer?
I want to know where they are.
Tom is in heaven now.
He waited for me until I arrived.
Why didn't you call me earlier?
I think Tom is hiding something from Mary.
Tom knows what it takes.
Would you answer some questions for me?
Tom heard a big explosion and ran outside to see what had happened.
"I'm sorry, but he is out now."
Where can we meet you?
I think you're cute.
You need not have come here so early.
Unlock the door.
I got my right leg hurt in the accident.
Tom and Mary both turned around to watch.
He was hit by a car.
We need more sugar.
I bought her a new car.
Tom asked Mary who had given her the picture.
He is always finding fault with me.
Don't stand in my way.
Tom waited patiently for three hours.
Come quickly.
Tom committed suicide in jail.
"If we're going to do this, let's do it right."
Is it really true that 30% of the people who live here have never seen the ocean?
How naive do you think I am?
You should pay more attention to what you say.
Don't worry about the past.
She was too short to see over the fence.
I don't know exactly.
Tom had dinner by himself.
Did you know this?
Everything is on schedule.
It was very strange.
Tom enjoys taking pictures.
"Well, what happened to her?"
Cancer can be cured if discovered in time.
I'll take the chance.
They started running.
It's still true today.
That's very interesting.
It will not be long before our food runs out.
I can't take my eyes off her.
Mary can sew very well.
Tom has no idea how to operate this machine.
I like being a teacher.
This color doesn't suit you.
"I'd like to insure this, please."
Have you paid your phone bill?
It is obvious that he is right.
Tom was my friend.
I bought this suit just for this occasion.
She laughed at the sight of his hat.
Tom tried to convince Mary to dye her hair red.
"Could you repeat that, please?"
You know I didn't mean it.
I assume you still live in Boston.
I took a shower.
You should take a day off.
Why don't you stop?
Who did you learn French from?
Where did you go yesterday?
We were running to and fro.
That happens every day.
Is he all right?
Tom warned me about you.
Do that for me.
Was it a full moon or a new moon?
I know Tom did it on purpose.
Didn't you notice it?
The car turned over and burst into flames.
Please keep me informed of whatever happens in my absence.
I gave him a gold watch.
You have absolutely no idea how hard it was to convince Tom to help us.
Tom unfolded the blanket.
Stop looking at that girl.
I cover twenty miles a day.
Keep walking.
We're both a lot older now.
I bought him a drink in return for his help.
This is my business card.
I fell asleep on the couch.
"At last, I completed my work."
The only one here that's able to do that is Tom.
All the bank robbers were wearing masks.
Do men and women think differently?
You can't change Tom.
There is an urgent need for blood donors.
There was food enough for us all.
Perhaps you could suggest something we can do tomorrow.
I prefer to go barefoot in the house.
The sudden increase of ultraviolet rays made the researchers believe in the existence of ozone holes.
Move over.
Our destination is still a long way off.
Are you thinking about Tom?
Tom won't likely do that unless Mary asks him to.
The population of this town has been static for the last ten years.
I was too surprised to speak.
It seems to me that he is honest.
"Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to Central Park?"
Will you have another glass of wine?
The question is what are you doing here.
I don't know how he can speak without taking the cigarette out of his mouth.
"As for me, I like chicken better than pork."
He informed me about the changes in the plan.
What was your major?
You look better in this dress.
I would never have believed that such a thing could ever happen to me.
She had a little money.
This glass is dirty.
I understand what you're saying.
"You don't really want to remain here, do you?"
Please keep in touch.
Maybe Tom can help you.
He's studying.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
It did happen.
You should go.
It has been confirmed.
The fine arts flourished in Italy in the 15th century.
There are a few boats on the lake.
Tom couldn't talk me out of going to the party.
I didn't know that Tom was Mary's son.
That's how I like it.
There's a trampoline in the backyard.
Tom is always asking dumb questions.
What do you want to do with that?
That's what I wanted to ask.
He may be a genius.
Where is the nearest lost and found?
Did you remember to go to the library?
I'm going to chock the wheels so the car won't move.
Tom told me you need help.
Watch your step.
Silkworms spin cocoons.
It doesn't seem very fair.
What's obvious is that you're not very happy here.
I have no idea where we are.
Don't you think it's time for you to settle down?
Please take your shoes off at the door.
I'm thirty.
I'm not going to go to Boston with you.
That cost me a lot in the long run.
Tom ate at his desk.
Don't let yourself be provoked into saying something that you'll regret.
Tom asked Mary what her last name was.
He will take over the business when his father retires.
What's the best way to punish a dog?
Charlemagne was crowned by the Pope.
I hope that I will meet her this evening.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I hope you'll soon get well.
"If you'd listen a little more carefully to what the teacher says, you'd probably be able to understand."
"Good night, everyone!"
Tom was never really in love with Mary.
You're doing everything wrong.
"May I come, too?"
Tom watched Mary dance.
Mary denied having stolen the money.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
He is a poet.
I like to learn ancient languages.
Tom is groaning.
This area was first settled by the Dutch more than two hundred years ago.
Did Tom say anything to you at all?
When did I ever lie to you?
The brave captain saved his ship.
"How's your mother, Tom?"
Tom called Mary a coward.
The old lady climbed the stairs with difficulty.
"There being nothing else to do, we went for a drive."
Tom returned Mary's smile.
Are we driving around in circles?
Maybe I'll fall asleep.
That tree looks dead.
The report revealed that many teenagers are alcoholics.
I don't want to wear this stupid tie.
Many inmates on death row say they don't want to die.
"When I asked Dad for more money, he really blew up and started to yell at me."
"The longer I waited, the more impatient I became."
This really happened.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
I hope your parents are well.
"If you feed your dog properly, you can increase his lifespan."
You should be put away.
Is this your purse?
Maybe Tom didn't hear you.
"Tom, I want you to speak to Mary."
Isn't that theirs?
Tom doesn't know how to play the bass guitar.
Tom and Mary often watch movies together.
He went to America to study American literature.
That's so mean.
It'll be our secret.
I can't put up with the noise any longer.
I ironed out the wrinkles in my pants.
The new furniture came today.
Did you notify Tom?
I don't have much money in my bank account.
"How many children do you have? ""I only have one."""
It would be fun.
Imported cars are in strong demand.
Students stand up when their teacher enters.
They're innocent men.
Tom can play both tennis and table tennis well.
This song's in the key of G.
You don't impress me.
Where does she live now?
I came here for a vacation.
What was he up to?
She's the most beautiful woman.
Is it important?
May I try it?
I'm going to stay at home tonight.
They were hungry.
Can you fix this or should I call a plumber?
Tom speaks French a little.
I am hungry because I did not eat breakfast.
Whose is this book?
We just want to have a few questions answered.
He is very careful.
It's very new.
You used to love coming here.
"In the evening, I walk with my dog."
He wished he had more time.
What time do you have supper?
The bird went up higher and higher into the sky.
He gave us quite a lot of trouble.
I want to visit Korea.
I know next to nothing.
I can't take it any longer.
I've been wanting to talk to you.
Show me what you can do.
Why do you always talk about Tom?
Mary is Tom's personal assistant.
Tom does love Mary.
What's that very tall building?
You shouldn't depend too much on other people to help you.
Tom does not like cheese.
Don't light the candle.
I wish things could've happened differently.
Do you think you can handle a few minutes alone with Tom?
I want to become a TV announcer in the future.
The old man is taking a walk in the park.
The family had a hard time after the war.
Alzheimer's disease affects nearly 50 million people around the world.
"I've heard you play the viola and you're not very good, are you?"
That's how it should be.
Take good care of yourself.
Tom did it.
What's this doing here?
Tom wanted you to know.
We will be together forever.
What you were taught is wrong.
I only need one hundred dollars.
I was very busy.
I'm not sure what Tom is trying to say.
I shouldn't have trusted you.
I've never met her.
I think you went too far.
Arabic is written from right to left.
I know your son.
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
You should leave it for tomorrow.
Revenge is a dish best served cold.
Curiosity killed the cat.
He was very happy.
You know that's a lie.
I was about to leave when the phone rang.
The new bridge is under construction.
He came just as I was leaving.
Tom bought a bottle of cheap red wine.
You must've hated Tom for what he did.
We went to the café that I told you about.
His advice is always very sensible.
Dogs like playing with other dogs.
I only want Tom.
She's not as beautiful as her sister.
You can't intimidate us.
He grinned from ear to ear.
The night is still young.
Is your child a boy or a girl?
Did you leave the door open?
Tom is probably cold.
Stop! You're hurting him!
"You do want that, don't you?"
What's Tom's nationality?
She earns a living as a writer.
What does this have to do with my family?
My friends are all married.
"After digressing, he returned to the subject."
Don't you want to hear my side of the story?
She testified that she saw the man.
I want to know what that is.
Keep the secret.
We can't rest until we finish doing this.
What will you use it for?
He has had a crush on her.
Let us do our job.
She has a cold.
I have a sharp pain here.
I’ve started learning Esperanto.
Nobody likes to do laundry.
I want to do some shopping around here.
What should we tell the others?
I didn't even think of that.
Tom has come home.
Did you grade the tests?
What's your favorite kind of book?
He is American.
You're very efficient.
Tom said he may do that.
We watched TV after lunch.
It's very important to respect the rules.
Where's the exit?
This is quite difficult for Tom.
I had my watch stolen yesterday.
She asked me if I knew her address.
You of all people should understand how Tom feels.
He lives in a small town near Osaka.
It sounds familiar.
Tom said he thought that I was dead.
I am surprised to learn this.
I have a whole lot of ideas.
Did Tom buy anything?
My guess is that it will rain soon.
I hope the bread keeps until tomorrow.
I should've done that sooner.
You let me down.
I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.
You have a nice family.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
I don't like to fly.
My French isn't that good.
Tom could hear Mary talking in the next room.
"If you want something done right, you should do it yourself."
I attempted to solve the problem.
"Excuse me, but where is the men's shoe department?"
Are you dating anyone?
He has a dog and six cats.
Enjoy the show.
I'm thinking of opening up a store.
Tom now wears a wig.
Tom is likely to pass today's exam.
Tom sat at his desk.
"Tom was thoughtless, wasn't he?"
Please mail this letter for me.
Tom is a great performer.
Does that make you sad?
I know that it's there.
Try this hat on and see if it fits you.
This is a book about stars.
He didn't come back to the base yesterday.
We need to help Tom.
"As far as I know, Tom is retired."
I want to go somewhere quiet.
How about going to see a movie with me?
Please feed the dog every day.
I heard you bought a new car.
My tastes differ greatly from yours.
I'm on my way to work now.
Tom seems more annoyed than angry.
Tom relented.
The man took the boy by the hand.
How about your place?
"As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away."
Mary isn't really sick. She's just faking it.
She left me standing there for two hours.
Be nicer to your brother.
Tom is motivated.
Why do you study English every day?
She advised him to see a lawyer.
What color do you think she likes?
She didn't go there yesterday.
She's wearing tights.
Why didn't anyone tell me anything about it?
You look Japanese.
The train was derailed.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
I objected when the waiter tried to remove my plate.
Tom didn't really have to do that today.
You'll get one.
My parents expect me to enter the university.
Do you have anything to add?
"She simply cannot keep her mouth shut, not even for a second."
It is up to you.
I was asked to show my passport at the border.
The police are here.
Tom has been in Boston since last Monday.
I'm thankful to be alive.
It's no longer available.
What kind of food do you like to eat?
How about going steady with me?
Does it work?
Did you hear the noise?
What will they do?
I'm looking for a gift for my father.
Let Tom finish what he started.
You really have to manage him carefully.
Tom looks crushed.
I've missed out on so much.
This is how Tom does it.
Tom will go.
When did you get home?
I'll call you up later.
The news upset me.
"Will you go, too?"
The view from this room is wonderful.
Did you threaten Tom?
Did you buy a return ticket?
Don't talk to me while I'm working.
Could you say that again?
I studied French when I was in high school.
Not everyone agreed.
"We bought the car for $12,000."
I thought you said I could count on you.
What is this thing?
It is a pity you cannot come.
I fear so.
Send me a message or give me a call if you're interested.
Tom has little chance of winning the election.
Tom started reading.
I took my shoes off.
I don't know who I should ask.
Tom doesn't seem to have any self-confidence.
I asked Tom why he wanted to go to Boston.
I can't see anything from here.
I suspect Tom and Mary are planning on being there.
Can I sit with you?
I'm pretty sure it's after 2:30.
Tom is at least a head taller than me.
Where's my tip?
You can do anything you want to.
Please hand in your papers by the last day of this month.
Tom was born on a ship.
I don't want to insult Tom.
Tom is planning to eat dinner with Mary tonight.
Tom runs a small hobby farm on the outskirts of town where he keeps a few sheep and cattle.
Tom's new book is about Mary.
There are many people that don't like me.
Can you speak French?
The medicine didn't do me any good.
Why did you do what you did?
"He lived in Spain, I think."
He is fond of playing tennis.
I won't answer questions.
Were you planning to do something special for Tom's birthday?
I understand what you're trying to tell me.
You'd better relax a bit.
My father swims very well.
Tom plans to throw away his old toaster.
I can't believe I'm still alive.
May I open the curtain?
She has no one to talk to.
I can't do it.
"Tom, it doesn't work that way."
He jumped from one subject to another.
When does it arrive?
Tom's convinced.
"Tom was told he would never amount to anything, and he was desperate to prove them wrong."
Is she gone?
Is Tom infected?
I'm busy all the time.
"Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can."
There is a bank in front of the station.
I'm still not used to the way things work here.
I think it is best not to be impolite.
No one's listening.
Tom is with Mary.
Tom abandoned hope.
The boy knocked the glass over.
Come and help us.
I can hear a cat scratching at the window.
"You don't get it, do you?"
This chair is very comfortable.
Don't let him put his feet on the table.
It's a village of two hundred inhabitants.
Tom tried to blame me for everything.
Tom thought Mary could get a job.
"Can I have two hamburgers and a coke, please?"
Tom appears to be in a lot of pain.
Tom could tell by the smile on Mary's face that she had had a good time at the party.
"That's what you wanted, wasn't it?"
My friend copied my homework and the teacher found out.
Is Tom coming with us?
Tom means well.
I've cut my finger.
I was a high school student at that time.
Don't let him answer the phone.
Tom was rescued by a passer-by.
You are absolutely right.
A stone does not float.
I'm not from Australia.
She caught my eye.
Whose glasses are these?
Show me what you've got.
He has no sense of direction.
The people of London are very proud of this bridge.
Tom says Mary doesn't have to stay here if she doesn't want to.
I don't remember where I put my glasses.
Tom was at home.
"On a clear day, you can see Mt. Fuji from here."
I'm not alone.
That's too good a story to be true.
I'm on my break.
To know oneself is not easy.
Father wants me to study abroad while I am young.
Where do I go after I pick up my baggage?
I am fully convinced of your innocence.
Tom thinks that Mary won't be able to pay all her bills this month.
Mary is as tall as Tom is.
I live in Boston and Tom lives in Chicago.
Tom had his car key in his left hand.
Perhaps he will come.
We will have guests tomorrow.
That's his specialty.
Would you please lower your voice?
Summer vacation begins next Monday.
I know what I'm doing.
We should wait here for the moment.
I fail to see what's so amusing.
I'm angry with her.
Tom has a mini-fridge in his room.
There was only one small problem.
They skip school all the time.
We're not busy.
Tom said Mary is a good mom.
The question deserved study.
Are we going to do that?
Tom is almost as tall as me.
It is like casting pearls before swine.
You could've said something.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
Please put their name on everything they take with them.
I believe they're a perfect match.
That's a good school.
Have you been keeping something from me?
I cannot help liking him in spite of his many faults.
All we need is a little patience.
I continued singing.
I think that it was his mistake.
The train was delayed on account of a heavy snow.
She is ashamed of what she's done.
How many times have I told you?
There used to be an old temple here.
He lost his balance and fell off the ladder.
"Tom, I'm happy for you."
Both boys and girls should take cooking class in school.
I can tell that you're worried.
I need Internet.
What do you have in your right hand?
Tom has won the prize.
He stood behind me.
My dream came true.
"Of all the languages I've studied, French was the hardest."
Keep up the good work.
Where shall we meet?
I gave Tom all my money.
You lean on your parents too much. You must be more independent.
Someone is lying.
Don't you think that's a bit strange?
There have been a lot of complaints from students about the amount of homework that Mr. Jackson gives.
I have a special surprise for you.
Never rub your eyes when your hands are dirty.
Roll the dice.
Tom hasn't fried the fish yet.
"Wait, it could be dangerous."
Tom seems pretty happy.
It was you that suggested seeing that movie.
Tom did not want to talk to the press about his personal life.
We saw her enter the room.
I'll be outside if you need me.
Tom wants to know who Mary's boyfriend is.
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom doesn't know when Mary got back from Boston.
A lot of people think that bats are birds.
I was ashamed to go out in old clothes.
I don't want to grow up.
He is sincere in his promises.
What type of person are you?
We swam in the sea.
I am not your enemy.
What else did you see?
Tom isn't afraid of you.
She loves antiques.
This food is too salty.
You can learn as much in the library as in school.
Tom walked down the street.
The apartment was furnished in the Victorian style.
"If it rains, bring the washing in."
Tom knew Mary.
I can't give up without a fight.
"One, three, five, seven and nine are odd numbers."
We learn to read and write.
It's all in your imagination.
Tom has a bad reputation.
Tom's wounded.
You can spend the night at our place.
He's standing in front of the door.
We have a lot more work to do before we can go home.
Your problem is you're easily distracted.
Tom turned pale.
I'll get you.
Tom fell asleep on the train.
I've been given a death sentence.
Tom wasn't allowed to see it.
I have to go to sleep.
There are many possible explanations.
I'd like you to see it.
I don't know when he'll come again.
I am shorter than you.
He came out of the shower naked.
Tom was accused of collaborating with the enemy.
I wonder if Tom still remembers me.
I'll be back at seven o'clock.
Let's not get distracted.
They don't understand.
I can't believe you actually did that.
Tom can't stop Mary.
Suggestions are welcome.
Will it be convenient for you to start work tomorrow?
Why do you want to die?
"When he reached the station, the train had already left almost half an hour before."
You're negligent.
Tom suggested that I change the lock on my door.
He was all alone in the house.
I can't tell you my plans.
Can you answer this riddle?
Tom sat cross-legged on the bed.
I apologized immediately.
Won't you have some more tea?
Could you tell me how to get to your office?
Tom said that he thought it wouldn't be possible to do that.
I love to go to the movies.
Tom ended up getting a good job.
I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom doesn't win.
"Could you spell it, please?"
I'm sure Tom is just fine.
The plane takes off at 8:00 a.m.
We have half a dozen eggs.
I don't know where Tom bought his computer.
I've just arrived. I haven't even unpacked my suitcases yet.
You'd better leave.
You can't force Tom to stay.
How long have you owned it?
I will fight.
Where does Tom go to school?
Tom asked to be driven home.
Your father is pretty tall.
The lion opened its huge mouth and roared.
There is a military base near here.
The store is closed Mondays.
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
Tom looked very good.
Have you ever been on TV?
The air became warm.
He doesn't watch television at all.
To some extent I agree with you.
Everything is never as it seems.
Why don't you go and have a look?
I don't think this is any of your business.
I wish I had a better memory.
Tom didn't waste any time.
Could you have done it?
Any questions?
Tom knows a lot about dogs.
There's no need for threats.
I love to see you laugh.
What in the world got into you?
Tom is really very smart.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
When was the last time you saw her?
Tom hardly ever eats meat anymore.
Tom and I often work together.
Tom was brokenhearted.
Tom put the key in the lock and paused a moment before he turned it.
Tell me where you got this.
I want to go to school and study hard.
Don't you want to know what Tom looks like?
The fat man jumped over the ditch and fell to the ground.
Who did it?
Tom will understand.
I phoned him.
I'm glad you accepted my offer.
Is Tom still at school?
You don't look well.
I want to know why you're doing this.
Let him enter.
Nobody can help you.
I went on reading.
Do you know how to use a computer?
American forces were withdrawn.
Tom went back to his hometown.
He gave up smoking two years ago.
You should read the kind of books that will be useful to you later in life.
I think it's time for me to join the fight.
A missed opportunity never comes again.
Will you help me pick out a tie to go with this suit?
There are cases where honesty doesn't pay.
An angle of 90 degrees is called a right angle.
I assume you're willing to take the risk.
My favorite German band is Juli.
We'll soon find out.
I have no idea what Tom was talking about.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
His behavior was anything but polite.
We used to live in Kobe.
Tom got married when he was just eighteen years old.
It's pretty clear you have a problem.
A student raised his hand when the teacher finished the reading.

Why do you want to kill me?

Football was played in China in the second century.
I'm just being careful.
"Tom is still somewhere in the building, I think."
The teacher collected the papers.
I'm not a bit tired.
I saw Tom again last night.
I don't have time for this.
My father had me wash the car.
To have doubts about oneself is the first sign of intelligence.
Tom saw her.
How long will it take for the mistake to be noticed?
I will come to your country some day.
"Thank you, I'd love to have another piece of cake, said the shy young man."
This machine is out of order.
I just got home from school.
She said she would be back soon.
I asked Tom not to call late at night.
Men talk about women all the time.
"They're Canadians, aren't they?"
Why haven't you gone to the police?
Don't talk nonsense.

She's pleased with her new dress.

Don't wait.
Don't take Tom too seriously.
Show me an example.
I don't have time to explain it now.
I'm happy to be here again.
She has a good command of English though she was brought up in Japan.
"Make way, please."
Why do you have to do it?
He fell into a deep sleep.
Tom smiled back.
Charity begins at home.
They smell bad.
I have something I have to talk to you about.
I knew Tom was waiting for Mary.
Tom took a closer look at it.
It was a problem difficult to solve.
Stop that right now.
This laptop computer is very thin.
You'll never guess what Tom did.
Tom likes to wear loose-fitting clothes.
Tom is thirty at most.
We are still hoping that Tom will get better.
Tell me your name.
I'm just glad it's over.
"Whenever I hear that song, I think of my younger days."
My mom worries all the time.
Tom is a third-year student.
He stays in touch with her.
Isn't that right?
"If you don't like Tom, just try to avoid him."
They have to be awake by 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.
The game is over.
"Even if it should rain, I will start tomorrow."

His house is easy to find.
We have everything under control.
I look on you as my best friend.
That's what I do.
Could you do me a favor?
Tom didn't pass today's exam.
I'm a natural blonde.
You don't have to go there.
I wonder why Tom left early.
What has become of him?
Take one of these.
Tom has curly hair.
It hurts here.
Why don't you just admit that you're wrong?
I'm not sure what's wrong with Tom.
Pizza is my favorite food.

Tom does that quite often.

The money disappeared.
"You have a dog, don't you?"
Tom shyly raised his hand.
He convinced me that it was not his fault.
What do you want from me?
Everyone agreed.
You can't deny that.
Your suggestion is of no practical use.
I stayed home all day.
It's probably just my imagination.
How about I do that?
I skipped breakfast.
This book is very good except for a few mistakes.
I think Tom isn't home.
"You like that, don't you?"

The box is heavy.
"Since she doesn't want to put on any more weight, she doesn't eat cake."
Tom bought a gift for Mary.
Tom is the youngest in his family.
Having a few extra batteries handy is never a bad idea.
You may or may not win.
Leave it where you found it.
Hand me that bar of soap.

"This is mine, isn't it?"
Tom got off of his motorcycle.
I don't know Tom's last name.
Why aren't you ready?
Your dog is here.
"I can't swim, but my younger brother can."
He doesn't run.
Tom lived with his uncle in Australia while going to college.

I don't know how to play bridge.
"I know that you are not supposed to download music off the internet without paying for it, but I do it anyway."
What would you like?
Tom looked at it more closely.
You don't seem to understand anything.
We were very disappointed in that girl.
That painting is a copy.
It's almost seven. We have to go to school.
I like to dance.
Maybe I should've done this sooner.
"You've painted the walls, haven't you?"
"Tom didn't think he had a chance to succeed, but he at least wanted to give it a shot."
Don't bother Tom.
I wish you'd stop doing that.
Tom doesn't have a computer.
Mary is wearing some sexy clothes.
This handmade Italian-made titanium bicycle is terribly light.
Tom's birthday was yesterday.
We have to catch up on our work as soon as possible.
Tom backed off.
Hang your clothes here.
Have you ever eaten Turkish food before?
My house was bombed during the war.
You look like Tom's wife.
I was out for a walk.
Tom burned the letter.
"If you come to my house, I will tell you the story in detail."
The suspect is a caucasian female.
I'm a city girl.
That's really quite an accomplishment.
"Compared to you, I'm just a beginner at this game."
She relied on the medicine as a last resort.
He reluctantly went to see her.
She gave me a watch for a birthday present.
He is the last man to do such a thing.
You can't leave us here.
The bowl contains many kinds of candy.
Where shall I hang this calendar?
I'm color-blind.
You always said you wanted to learn French.
What's in it for you?
I am a stranger here.
This book contains forty photographs.
I'm always surprised by him.
A pretty girl like you will definitely be noticed.
Tom kept a squirrel as a pet.
"Can I talk to Tom, please?"
Tom was as naked as a jaybird.
They are the ones who want to go.
It doesn't sound natural.
You're motivated.
Can you do a headstand?
We have seen three wars.
Tom is a big eater.
I have no idea who Tom's wife is.
Tom couldn't open the door.
The tea is too strong. Add some water.
I suppose he'll come.
I didn't get an invitation.
I usually go home at four.
I haven't forgiven you.
Be careful.
I learned it by heart.
Who'll go?
What would you do if war were to break out?
This room is well furnished.
That's all nonsense.
You're not allowed to speak French here.
Put it down.
That doesn't mean anything.
Please sit down.
Tom didn't suffer.
What are the measurements of the shelf?
You look fabulous.
I am a bit drunk.
Tom lived to be 97.
We must leave early.
This makes us stronger.
Have you ever eaten anything that made you hallucinate?
She said she had a cold.
Who was it?
I speak English every day.
Tom had a lot of catching up to do.
Does your wife know?
Why are you still here?
Mary mixed the ingredients to make a cake.
I haven't forgotten.
How did you manage to get Tom to do that?
I dreamed I was eating an apple pie.
Tom is a friend from school.
He gave it to me.
He married a dark-haired Italian girl.
We're so glad you could make it.
I'm going to do my best.
Tom is hardworking and dependable.
Tom wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary got married on Valentine's Day.
Be very careful with that blue box.
A rumor circulated through the city.
"Nickel is a hard, silver-white metal."
It was really horrible.
They'll need help.
"I'm sorry, but we cannot meet your requirements."
I haven't finished eating yet.
I made up my mind to be a doctor.
I urgently need to talk to Tom.
I'm happy to be here.
He drank detergent by mistake.
This fountain pen is as good as any I have ever used.
Can you also count in Italian?
Elephants are an endangered species.
Tom put the book on the shelf.
It was a magic moment.
Is this your briefcase?
He has been to America.
I promise this will never happen again.
I wonder if Tom will be here tomorrow.
"When Mary was a child, her family was dirt poor."
How many books do you have?
How did Tom manage to lose so much weight so quickly?
I admire your courage.
Boil the milk bottles.
Why are you always defending her?
Someone left you a message.
She's inquisitive by nature.
She's not as tall as him.
Where can I buy a brush?
Do you think I don't know what you did?
It would be a pity if you let this opportunity pass you by.
Yesterday a foreigner spoke to me in English on the train.
"Once she starts talking, she is hard to stop."
The prime minister paid a formal visit to the White House.
Start again.
Nobody gave us a chance.
"Where did you find it, at school or at home?"
I can't find it. Are you sure it's here?
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
They're wrong.
"As far as I know, no one here has seen Tom today."
The piano was invented in the 18th century by Bartolomeo Cristofori.
"When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus had already left."
I lent Tom a book about Germany.
Some Germans work for only one euro an hour.
I do not want to work.
Tom has fainted.
Tom appears nervous.
He suddenly missed his watch.
I'm so glad you've come.
He has been to London three times.
This is the most fun I've had in my life.
It's Tom's car.
It'll take a week or so to read through this book.
He is wearing glasses.
Tom isn't Mary's boyfriend anymore.
How did he find us?
Carelessness often results in accidents.
I've never seen you cook. Can you cook anything at all?
I'm glad to see you in one piece.
Perhaps Tom was wrong.
A strange car was parked in front of my house.
"In spite of the heavy rain, he decided to go out."
It was quite dark when I got home.
I work for McDonald's.
I have had a corn removed from my foot.
That's confusing.
You have a lot of books.
The village is now very different from what it was ten years ago.
Tom is unreliable.
The riot was soon put down by the police.
Tom says he saw Mary.
He dreaded having to spend Christmas in the hospital.
What I say is true.
I went to Nagasaki.
She didn't answer.
What're you saying?
Let me tell you my side of the story.
He accused her of having lied to him.
I have nothing to do with the affair.
Your dog is very fat.
Tom graduated from college at the top of his class.
Why are you laughing?
Have you ever seen any famous people in this restaurant?
I can always go back to my parents' home.
Where can I pick up my baggage?
Tom barely ate.
Choose three books at random.
They're all older than you.
Tom is in real trouble.
Never tell a lie!
Please send me a reply as soon as you receive this mail.
What time is it in Boston?
How large is the population of Shizuoka City?
I have some good news and some bad news.
What are they doing out there?
Tom can operate a forklift.
Tom seemed wise.
You have a beautiful sister.
This room is comfortable.
Something is wrong with this calculator.
Tom was sobbing.
He wrote me a love letter.
"Tom is still in love with you, I think."
A fool always finds a greater fool to admire him.
Tom handed Mary a glass of red wine.
Who will take the place of his mother?
You could lead.
You aren't here.
"To tell the truth, I didn't notice it."
"You think I did it, don't you?"
Do we have to watch this?
I don't think Tom is happy.
When does the restaurant close?
I think it would be dangerous for you to do that.
Who did Tom go bowling with?
Tom and Mary were still sleeping when John left for school.
Tom is often disrespectful towards his teachers.
Tom proposed to me.
Please don't touch me.
Tom woke up to watch the sunrise.
I bought an electric car.
All the girls seem to have fallen in love with Tom.
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.
All of us can speak French.
I wish you'd go.
I got here as fast as I could.
He gets up at 7.
I don't really like to talk about it.
I answered the phone.
Let Tom go home.
The milk turned sour.
Tom confessed.
I get up at six.
I appreciate what you did for me.
Drink less and sleep more.
I get up at 6:30.
Some people don't wear pajamas.
The cafe is run by students.
The man in charge of the merry-go-round decided to make sure everything was working properly.
Tom didn't want his friends to see him cry.
He seems ill.
Teachers should deal fairly with their students.
The bus driver suffered minor injuries.
I had to pay 5 dollars in addition.
Tom took out his handkerchief and blew his nose.
I know who was in Tom's office at 2:30.
I'm a rich man.
Tom doesn't like Mary doing that.
"You didn't eat much lunch, did you?"
He is my brother.
We were running to and fro.
When did you last see my brother?
He was busy copying his friend's notebook.
Tom is not as spry as he used to be.
The student council discussed plans for the graduation.
Ten minus two is eight.
I wonder why Tom is worried.
Tom rarely laughs.
He was busy.
I wasn't drunk.
I'm not wearing any underwear.
That man has one box.
"If it's okay with you, I'd like to take it slow. I really don't want to rush into things."
He was busy when I called him up.
Where can we meet you?
I'm going running.
Try it again.
"Look, it's the North Star."
Write down your name here.
Tom put everything back where it belonged.
Tom asked me to buy him something to drink.
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom has to listen to us.
I don't even know your address.
The country was industrialized very quickly.
There was green slime oozing out of the pipe.
Please say yes.
Tom is playing with Mary's cat.
I gave Tom another chance.
She wears beautiful clothes.
Is that important?
I'll take back everything I said.
Tom said he thought that the statue weighed about 300 pounds.
Tom's eyes widened in surprise.
We are in part responsible for it.
Do you need money?
He hates his neighbor.
The boy came back.
What you say is right.
I wrote it myself.
The train will arrive at ten o'clock.
I don't want you to worry.
We don't have a chance.
We have a few questions for you.
How long were you at the party?
That's what I hope.
My husband is in high spirits today.
It's great to be here.
We dined at our uncle's.
Beat it.
She was kind enough to show me around the town.
I was having trouble concentrating.
Is that all you have to say to me?
The flight attendant shook Tom awake and told him that the plane had landed.
Do you still want to give me a hug?
Simplicity is the key.
"I have a surprise for you, sweetheart."
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
What would you like to eat for dinner?
It is hardly worth discussing.
I'll introduce you to the team.
We've forgiven you.
Are you wearing that dress for the first time?
I'd like you to assist Tom.
Tom is already hard at work.
I will get it for you.
Our team lost all of its games.
Did you have a piano lesson that day?
Where are you heading?
You promised me you'd take care of Tom.
You have to live here.
That's really surprising.
What can you give me?
I wrote this letter in French.
I usually don't wear a watch.
We got on like a house on fire.
Where's my microphone?
Tom liked working here.
You shouldn't have eaten the fish raw.
What have you learned about Tom?
Will you pick out a tie for me?
"It's your fault, not mine."
It's your civic duty to vote.
Her garden is a work of art.
Tom thought only of Mary.
What is that thing?
There has been no rain here for the past two weeks.
I am thinking of going abroad.
Don't write in ink.
That's how Tom does it.
We just want to find Tom.
You should pay for it.
When was the last time you ironed your clothes?
He's a good boy.
We went to the museum.
I think it's unlikely that Tom will be arrested.
How about a cup of coffee?
He's a good person.
Tom and Mary often talk to each other using Skype.
Tom hasn't written me back.
We can rely on Tom.
Tom knows what Mary did three days ago.
There's no need to panic. There's plenty of time.
It would take a long time to explain it to you.
Tom didn't know what to do.
I can't reach any of the books on the top shelf.
I have no idea what to expect.
Could I ask you a big favor?
Has Tom ever told you how he met Mary?
I can't put up with the noise.
I cooked dinner.
Tom is perplexed.
It suddenly started raining.
My father writes in his diary every day.
You should have acted on her advice.
Tom has much more free time than Mary.
Do come in!
Tom didn't seem very busy.
Would you like some champagne?
He didn't keep his promise that he would telephone me soon.
Tom said that he would buy it.
Tom paid.
The toilet is over there.
I was surprised to get your call.
I've never seen anything quite like this.
Tom does it all the time.
Tom knows how to make Mary happy.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
"Come on, sing with me."
Tom had no choice but to grin and bear it.
"She fell ill, but got well soon."
I will learn.
There's a fine line between love and hate.
I still have to do that.
Is this ball yours or hers?
She is very wise.
The opening ceremony took place on schedule.
Did you have a good sleep?
I am accustomed to living alone.
I'll pick you up in ten minutes.
Both Tom and Mary cut themselves on some broken glass.
"He's two years older than me, but he's shorter."
Are you ready to fly?
What did Tom do with the money?
She dropped in at my house yesterday.
The country is heading in the right direction.
They'll find Tom.
Is that a good thing?
You don't seem to understand anything.
It's not that noticeable.
He collapsed to his knees.
I don't trust anyone.
Where did you see the woman?
A lot of people are dealing with allergies now.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
This is a story about a cat.
Tom didn't even know how to kiss a girl.
The telephone rang a few minutes later.
Tom shut the door and locked it.
Is it Christmas again already?
She speaks loudly.
Is there anything else I can help you with?
We had to walk all the way to the station.
I'm expecting a customer today.
I want to know why you lied to me.
This isn't my umbrella; it's somebody else's.
Don't touch anything.
He had trouble breathing.
I opened the windows.
Do you object to my idea?
He runs fast.
You're as beautiful as ever.
This box contains apples.
Tom deserves better.
The bookshelf is built in.
He got a D.
I was happy to see him.
Tom staggered off.
He adapted himself to circumstances.
Tom's coming.
This website is very useful.
Do your parents know that you're here?
I'm glad you made it.
Tom lay awake for a long time wondering about what he should do.
"Tom threw a rock at Mary, but it didn't hit her."
That horse came in first.
Tom doesn't know why Mary didn't come to the party.
The food is ready.
Rome is in Italy.
"We're in a hurry, so let's take a taxi."
Do you intend to help Tom?
Tom knows he can always count on Mary.
Please take me to the airport.
Do you have any sunscreen?
Wild animals live in the forest.
I'm sure that Tom won't mind.
Let me see what's in your hand.
It was a dangerous time.
The chairperson cut me short.
Somebody needs to be here for the children.
You should go to bed. It's almost midnight.
Tom took a walk through the garden.
Do you have a ballpoint pen?
Did you enjoy the salad?
My back still hurts.
I lost your number.
The boy was lying on his stomach watching TV.
I don't have anything to write with.
I'm half Japanese.
All you have to do is write it down.
Tom is sleeping like a log.
You are not permitted to bring dogs into this building.
I'm just trying to get by.
They walked toward the gate.
Tom isn't a great player.
Where are you going for your holidays this year?
Tom lived to be 97 years old.
Return immediately.
When did you meet her?
Tom is the boy who broke the window.
That mattress needs to be aired out.
Can you guys solve the puzzle?
Take any books that you want to read.
Why don't you like it here?
Tom spent three weeks in the hospital.
They walked upstairs.
Don't be shy.
Tom is very tired.
Looks can be deceiving.
What kind of house does Tom live in?
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
This is a remake of a classic movie.
We saw a white ship far away.
This is the most difficult book I have ever read.
Who taught you to write?
She gets up early.
I am six feet tall.
I don't hate you anymore.
You're joking!
I didn't notice how she was dressed.
It was well worth the cost.
Where do these come from?
Tom told Mary that he had finished the work she had asked him to do.
Write these words in your notebook.
I have only half as many books as he does.
You never answered the question.
It was real.
Do you think that I'm not trying?
You always were one of my best students.
"If you run a red light, you risk causing an accident."
Does Tom know where Mary is?
She has a great appetite for adventure.
You made a promise.
It's not a suitable topic for discussion.
What would you have done in my place?
The movie isn't as good as the book.
The protesters set many cars on fire.
Is it helping?
Tom almost looks like a girl.
Are you sure you don't want to use the toilet before you go?
It's not the same thing.
Tom hasn't come yet. He must've missed the bus.
I'd suggest the following change.
I'm too tired.
Tom is haunted by his past.
You did that on purpose.
He often leaves work very late.
Isn't Tom funny?
The car and seat number are written on the ticket.
Tom isn't as stubborn as Mary is.
Who wouldn't love to find one of these under the tree on Christmas morning?
The rule should be revised.
I have no idea where Tom hid the money.
You'd make a good diplomat.
Tom didn't feel like waiting.
To what extent can he be trusted?
I'm tied up now.
I gotta do what I've gotta do.
Tom doesn't want to talk right now.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they plan to get married.
I can't live like this anymore.
This is pathetic.
I was quite surprised.
We can't stop here.
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I want to pick out a present for my friend.
What's it going to take to persuade you?
I have already heard this joke.
Don't give Tom your number.
"I know you like to travel, Tom."
That's the ugliest hat I've ever seen.
It is located at the foot of Mt. Fuji.
She keeps complaining that she doesn't have time.
A true friend just tells it like it is.
Tom was not jealous.
Get back to work!
Her mother is not as old as she looks.
The boy playing the guitar is my younger brother.
"You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?"
Tom doesn't like swimming in pools. He prefers swimming in lakes and rivers.
"As far as I am concerned, I have no objection."
I want to eat.
"Are you hungry? ""I'm always hungry."""
Are you sure about this?
Tom was also arrested.
You're very attentive.
Put down the knife.
I'd love to get one of those.
Why are you talking like that?
Can you order it for me?
"Hurry up, guys."
I've come here to study Chinese.
I want to show you something very special.
"If you don't want to go, you don't need to."
We have to keep trying until we succeed.
Will you be sticking around Boston for a few more days?
I'm not crazy. You're the one who's crazy.
Tom left five minutes ago.
Welcome to your new home.
Close the door when you leave.
Did you solve the problem?
What time does the first train leave?
Thank you for understanding.
I just showered.
Tom wanted me to tell you to buy a couple of loaves of bread on your way home.
You know that better than I do.
I don't care if anyone believes me or not.
Tom couldn't eat peanuts when he was a child.
Can you help me find my keys?
They scraped barnacles off the hull of the ship.
How many cups of coffee did you drink today?
Why is this computer so slow?
He seems to be wary of us.
"I don't want to have kids, and I don't want to get married."
He tried many different methods.
I've made a discovery.
"Tom told his teacher that he had been sick, but that wasn't true."
This doesn't concern us.
How can I get there?
Sorry I'm late. I overslept.
Everything went according to plan.
"I'm suspicious of people who don't like dogs, but I trust a dog when it doesn't like a person."
Tom speaks French fairly well.
My mother speaks slowly.
You're not telling the truth.
And how are things in Washington?
All you have to do is push this red button.
She is opening the window.
Put these letters in the mail box.
May I borrow your headphones?
This is my brother's.
They're gone.
Tom became friends with Mary when he was living in Boston.
Tom heard a knock and walked over to the door to open it.
I have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow.
I love doing that.
You could do that.
I knew you'd like Boston.
There is an urgent need for experienced pilots.
"Come on, hurry up."
They're a good hockey team.
"He did a lot for his people, but he could have done much more."
Look at me when I talk to you!
I want to go abroad.
The lawyer appealed to the jury's sense of justice.
Tom has to stay.
Tom said he didn't see anything out of the ordinary.
Is the cat all right?
I'd like to know what's happening here.
Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
I guess it's true.
"If you park here, your car will get towed."
I know I can count on you all.
Tom didn't want to get out of bed.
I know all the details.
Speaking English is difficult.
We still want to help you.
Mary has danced since she was five.
Tom accidentally knocked over his drink.
I go to Kyoto.
Tom can never remember how to spell my name.
Do you have anything non-alcoholic?
It's no trouble at all.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.
The Colonel said the situation is under control.
I see the boy.
This restaurant has valet parking.
They hardly have any time left.
Tom wouldn't have wanted it that way.
We're not rich.
I studied hard in order to pass the examination.
What is missing?
This wasn't an easy task.
What does Tom say?
Can you deliver that?
Tom isn't very talkative.
You are responsible for this accident.
The teacher suspected the student was cheating.
What do you want me to tell Tom?
I prefer plain materials.
You swim very quickly.
How's Tom's cold?
The teacher enjoyed talking with some of the graduates.
He might have been sleeping at that time.
The man robbed the traveler of his money.
Tom told everybody he was able to speak three languages.
"Excuse me, what's the shortest route to the station?"
Each of the three girls got a prize.
He told a funny story.
Each person paid one thousand dollars.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
He disclaimed all responsibility for the accident.
Sixty delegates were elected.
This guy is a loser.
Tom wasn't armed.
No one believes what Tom says anymore.
My dad goes out for a walk every morning.
The sentence doesn't have any grammatical errors.
Could you please move over to make some room?
Isn't it black?
I saw them.
He was scared to admit that he didn't know.
She is more clever than beautiful.
They are my cousins.
Tom and I work at the same hospital.
Stop Tom.
"You can play a musical instrument, can't you?"
I'll help you if you help me.
You should tell your mother as soon as possible.
Don't you want to go?
Tom writes everything down.
Please give me another chance.
Did you hear about the time Tom tried to kill Mary?
Tom didn't know their names.
I'm going to wait here for Tom.
They decided to leave extra food behind.
It is Pochi's food.
I feel guilty about it.
Do you know how to use it?
A guard's been killed.
He visited many countries in Asia.
Tom claimed he had nothing to do with Mary's murder.
Come quickly!
Tom says he won't need to do that now.
His letter says he'll arrive next Sunday.
Tom rubbed his face.
"I grabbed my little sister's hand, and the two of us started running."
She worships him.
English is a global language.
Christmas is just around the corner.
He is a gentleman. He cannot have said such a thing.
Please fill the teapot with boiling water.
It was not easy for us to find his house.
Who's at the door?
Don't ask too many questions.
Take the bags upstairs.
I wonder if I can ask you a few questions about Tom.
I want to go.
"Give it to me, Tom."
Don't be afraid to make a mistake.
Tom invited Mary to supper.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and stood up.
She has been waiting for him thirty minutes.
We need to hire more people.
Tom was tortured by the police.
How many of your students are here?
Why are people so careless?
Tom has a good head for numbers.
Don't walk so fast.
My father has many books.
The party was pretty boring at first.
The floor is very slippery.
I passed the information on to him.
Many people have made the same mistake.
"Taking no notice of the people around them, the boys talked loudly to each other."
Did you enjoy your holiday?
Tom wrote a lot of stories.
She kicked him hard.
Where can I rent a bike?
What drives you?
Tom broke his collarbone when he was thirteen.
I think you'll find it very interesting.
It is raining hard.
Tom got hurt in an accident at work.
"Stand back, please."
I'll go and look for Tom.
This was my plan all along.
"In times like this, we should all pull together."
Tom stepped off the train.
Please don't get me wrong.
"He can speak French, and obviously English."
Tom spends a lot of time helping Mary do her homework.
"You were very busy, weren't you?"
You had better learn either English or French.
We'll speak to Tom later.
I can't change what happened.
I think I can probably speak French better than Tom.
I didn't kiss anyone.
There are many stores on either side of the street.
Look at the picture at the top of the page.
Do I owe you something?
Do you know why Tom is absent from school?
The dolphins leapt out of the water.
Tom's first girlfriend was a blonde.
Tom refused to work with Mary.
I've been subpoenaed.
Tom always makes fun of John because of his dialect.
I see you're at it again.
He got down on his knees and prayed for the souls of the deceased.
You cannot be serious.
I need to get back to work.
Can you stay for a few days?
This room gets little sunshine.
Tom isn't the one who did this.
Tom wanted Mary to know that he didn't hate her.
Tom wore a V-neck T-shirt.
I can't tell you everything.
What? What did you say?
Life is too short to worry about things like that.
He will make my sister a good husband.
I brought mine. Did you bring yours?
A girl is playing the flute.
He is beginning to lose his hair.
Tom stayed there.
I can't stay here anymore.
We work in a factory.
I have a pain in my back.
He left for no reason whatsoever.
She likes to cook for her family.
I'm as healthy as a horse.
We have to stop Tom.
He loved her very much.
I could tell Tom wasn't pleased.
Fishing is prohibited here.
Tom was lying on the pier getting a suntan.
Can we sing?
I'd like you to meet my son.
Tom always wears dark clothes.
How did you achieve that?
What's your favorite song on this album?
There is no doubt that I could not do it without your help.
It was a big mistake.
Tom is interested.
We sometimes meet them.
I am going to go to America next year.
Tom will be back by 2:30.
The first phase of construction has been completed.
She is devoted to her husband.
We talked about yesterday's test.
I'm not gullible.
Tom is very close to his girlfriend's family.
You had better get up early.
"If Tom did not have this pillow, he would miss it very much."
Tom is going to shoot Mary.
Am I still in charge here?
Tom reached out his hand.
Tom has changed his name to John.
Tom spends most of his money on food.
I can't believe how beautiful you are.
What do you think of this plan?
I didn't catch one single fish.
Tom sustained minor injuries when he was struck by a car on the pedestrian crossing.
"If I were to tell you the truth, you would be surprised."
We miss you very much.
Is it an emergency?
I was ten minutes late for school.
Tom didn't know what to do with it.
Tom and Mary were my backup singers back when I used to perform.
He's really selfish.
Warn Tom.
How did you hear about that?
I wish I could figure out how to delete my Facebook account.
Get out of here quickly!
I parked my car next to yours.
It's still not working.
What's your room number?
The woman is reading.
The lady came from a good family.
I can't do anything about it.
We've done what we could.
You must not stay in bed.
Tom backed away.
They were afraid of being overheard.
Tom should've let his children go camping with us.
I want to be rich.
"If Tom hadn't eaten the mushrooms he found in the woods, he'd be alive now."
Would somebody please tell me what's going on here?
I hear something.
Tom couldn't have done it without you.
He made his parents happy.
The American troops held their ground.
"It's late and we're all tired, so I think we should go home."
The rain lasted for three days.
Their father is a taxi driver.
Is Tom intrigued?
Don't I owe you something?
We walked along the shore of the lake.
Tom didn't intend to call Mary.
Nobody called Tom.
Did he have sandwiches for lunch?
Did Tom enjoy it?
Tom still has a slight limp.
He made me so angry that I got a headache.
I cannot decide whether to go or not.
Tom cycles to work.
The boy was laughed at by everybody.
This pillow is softer than the other one.
She reads a great deal.
What would've happened if Tom had seen us?
I don't know his name.
Many people shop here.
"From what I've heard, I think Tom is going to get fired."
I never thought I'd see you alive again.
I went out with my friends.
Who does the gun belong to?
That's a tall order.
It seems a waste of time to wait any longer.
We have to find Tom before the police do.
They were sleeping.
Tom said he thought he knew what the problem was.
I've climbed Mt. Fuji.
Tom regained consciousness.
Don't come any closer.
There were 30 members in all.
I am a translator.
Didn't you know that Tom could play the guitar?
Do you like English?
Did you buy a new car?
Tom likes raw carrots.
Why's Tom always here?
Tom could see that a potentially dangerous situation could arise.
What do you want to be?
"If you hurt her, I'll kill you."
I checked into a hotel and went right to sleep.
Don't ask me what that is.
Tom kissed Mary gently.
Tom is an old friend.
Tom says that anyone can be hypnotized.
Take the next right.
Are you in a good mood?
The government asked the army to send a disaster relief mission to Okinawa.
He didn't know what to do next.
Don't sit there. That's Tom's chair.
I hope I sing better next time.
Will you please put the baby to bed?
He climbed the tree without difficulty.
Do you think Tom is in love with you?
I felt like crying.
Tom's wife is unemployed.
I like studying wild flowers.
"Long, long ago, there lived an old king on a small island."
I told Tom I'm from Boston.
You really should've been more clear about what you wanted.
I wonder what has happened to her.
It's easier than I thought.
Tom could tell Mary wasn't happy.
It was such a cold day that there was nobody on the street.
Please don't look at me like that.
You look hot.
"It's about time we brought this party to an end, isn't it?"
Tom spoke French.
Your face is pale.
It's too long.
I'm taking it with me.
I'm happy for you.
That would be dangerous.
I wonder where to hang this picture that Tom gave me.
Tom likes taking walks with Mary.
Do you have a friend named Tom?
Do you want to go on a trip with me?
I've got no money left.
It has been raining since Tuesday.
Tom says I can't stay home alone.
What Tom really wanted was some time with his children.
"If I were you, I would apply for the scholarship."
I wouldn't want you to think I was stupid.
I'm sure you meant well.
Tom has a possible solution.
Turn the volume up.
We don't have this in Europe.
What's your favorite video game?
"I've tried to get along with Tom, but it's impossible."
He's talking on the telephone.
He did it in good faith.
This problem is a real challenge.
I dislike being alone.
Tom died of a drug overdose.
School is over now.
A blanket of silence fell over everyone when they heard the disappointing announcement.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
A sleeping child looks like an angel.
I thought we were supposed to meet Tom at 2:30.
There's a slight difference.
Don't play with matches.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
You can't go yet.
I'm too busy to have time to enjoy myself.
Did you tell on Tom?
Your name came up at the meeting today.
Did you like this book?
This word was borrowed from French.
We already ate.
Tom and Mary both should know better.
I've loved you for a long time.
Tom thinks you're cute.
Tom is getting bored.
Tom will find you.
It's not mine.
I called him.
"How do you say ""kaisha"" in English?"
What do you think about global warming?
Promise me you won't give Tom my phone number.
Don't you have anything smaller than this?
Tom didn't want us at his party.
The lost child was found after two days.
The bank isn't open on Sundays.
You can use English at most hotels around the world.
Tom's father retired early.
Why didn't you just do what you said you'd do?
Tom fell asleep at the wheel and caused an accident.
I'm not ready for it yet.
Don't you like girls?
I know exactly what you're feeling.
You've just got to try harder.
I wish I had gone with the others to the game yesterday.
Don't waste your allowance on useless things.
What were you doing up there?
Tom works part-time after school.
How do you like your new apartment?
I have become forgetful.
He has two pencils. One is long and the other one is short.
Any further discussion is pointless.
I want these people out of here.
Tom was evasive.
They wanted proof.
They could've run away.
Tell me where you plan to go for your summer vacation.
This company has been spying on its employees.
He can run faster than me.
This purse is made of paper.
It's too small.
What have you told them?
"Right now, we have blueberries, blackberries, cherries, strawberries, peaches and nectarines."
It's a great conversation starter.
She can't have written it herself.
You should quit smoking.
Where's your other brother?
"If that happens, I'll be very glad."
Tom is exhausted.
You don't need to hurry.
The bathtub is dirty.
Where did you take your gloves off?
I don't want the money.
Don't be late for school tomorrow.
"Measure twice, cut once!"
Don't be a wallflower.
What do you want to hear from me?
Tom is still angry.
I like the color of this car.
What are they drinking?
Tom died a long time ago.
I'm just too busy to take a vacation now.
Tom wore a hat.
Tom concluded his speech with a proverb.
I wish Tom would help me move the sofa.
"When you come across new words, you must look them up in your dictionary."
Miami is the biggest city in Florida.
Who did you buy this for?
I'm hungry. How about you?
I know I'm good enough.
Tom says that learning a foreign language is hard.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
How can you tolerate that rude fellow?
He doesn't smoke.
Imagine that you begin to hiccup and can't stop.
The accident happened through his carelessness.
I don't know what to buy him for his birthday.
"She fainted, but came to after a few minutes."
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore.
We need to call the police.
That doesn't really make any sense.
She's a very interesting person.
Tom left about thirty minutes ago.
You can keep this one for yourself.
I don't plan to do that by myself.
"No matter how much I think about it, I can't understand it."
I prefer cats to dogs.
Unfortunately the telephone was out of order.
He came late as usual.
You're not too old for this job.
He was hard to please.
"I listened for a long time, but I didn't hear anything."
I think that helped me.
I have to get to Tom.
I like to take a shower at night.
I woke up and you were already gone.
I thought you thought Tom wasn't interested in sports.
Of course I was joking.
"As soon as he saw me, he ran away."
I took a taxi because the bus was late.
Did you eat your spinach?
Be more careful from now on.
Don't eat too much.
He put all his heart and soul into it.
One of the boys suddenly ran away.
It rained nonstop.
Please open this box.
Half an hour passed.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
I already ordered.
Where is the bus?
Let's talk over the matter.
"They went to the mountains, but the weather wasn't nice."
He got up early so he'd be in time for the train.
The bill passed at the last moment.
He was petting the dog.
I'll take this umbrella.
Tom didn't mention you by name.
Where do we have to do that?
You cannot be serious.
Tom has left us.
Thanks for calling. I was just about to call you.
"In Kyoto, you can see both old and modern buildings."
I didn't know for certain which train to take.
She didn't tell me her secret.
Is this the right way to Yokohama Station?
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
The brake stopped working.
You can't just not do your job.
Which way are you going?
We're objective.
I have no wish to live in a large city.
Thanks for seeing me.
It's not here.
The city library underwent extensive renovations and can now accommodate twice as many books as before.
Come again.
Why don't you all come with me?
He taught himself French.
The hunter aimed a shotgun at the flock of birds.
Is there a hat shop nearby?
Tom is going on thirty.
I made it myself.
They understand now.
Tom shooed the flies away.
I just don't feel like going out tonight.
If you don't keep quiet I'll punch you in the nose.
All of us will die sooner or later.
How do I know you're not an imposter?
I know a way to find out.
I didn't notice when he left the room.
What could you have done?
He is Japanese by birth.
I haven't been outside in weeks.
How did you come by those rare books?
I have never been spoken to by a foreigner before.
Why are we really here?
It's time for me to go.
We're all prisoners.
Tom likes to write.
Have you discussed this with anyone?
Have you ever seen a spider spinning its web?
"No matter how hard you try, you can't finish it in a day."
"Tom is nervous, too."
It is said that he is sick.
I can only speak for myself.
Stop teasing your sister!
You can't escape.
I'm better off alone.
You can go to prison for that.
I saw her leaving the room.
Don't read my journal.
My father and mother were sitting under a tree.
It never happened.
He was accused of murdering his wife and child.
All the students here must study French.
My brother has a good memory.
Do they sell notebooks at that store?
Who did you get that from?
What are you people thinking?
You will never be too old to learn.
You have reached your destination.
I really miss them.
Did you like the book that Tom lent you?
Practice makes perfect.
Tom should be home by 2:30.
I don't trust you anymore.
I lost interest in my work.
Do you have an English dictionary?
Tom is the only one still in the classroom.
How much does your daughter weigh?
You should get your eyes examined.
Of course you have to pay. What did you think?
How many siblings do you have?
I think Tom may want to do that.
Tom had no idea what I was talking about.
Do you remember when Tom said that?
The wheel began to turn.
I studied it thoroughly.
My father complained about the traffic noise.
Tom doesn't want to live with me.
I lied to my parents.
I wanted to talk to you anyway.
I trust him completely.
"Tom insisted he hadn't been drinking, but his slurred speech and unsteady gait gave him away."
I'm sure that my daughter will pass the exam.
Whether we will go on the trip depends on the weather.
Have you ever been stung by a scorpion?
That's what love is.
She stooped to pick up a pebble.
Do you know where Tom is?
Is Tom nearby?
The teacher is with the school principal.
Why don't you help Tom?
Tom was in a wheelchair.
Are you sure about the cost of that car?
Tom became a famous singer.
It's okay.
Tom set his alarm clock for 2:30.
I bought this book as a gift for Tom.
I think I'm OK.
Tom is lying.
You could help me.
I know you want to be rich.
I have little money now.
Tom immediately recognized Mary's voice.
The girl playing the piano is my daughter.
Step into the light.
This is a great day.
He is one of the best brains in our country.
Living in the town is quite different from living in the country.
"She isn't paid monthly, but daily."
She's pregnant with twins.
It's good to be back in Boston.
I'm flabbergasted.
I can check that for you.
I didn't want to tell you.
The shopping center will be demolished.
It could be a hoax.
Tom was on the same flight as me.
Tom is a realist.
I was more than a little embarrassed.
We know what you did was right.
I can't find Tom. I've looked everywhere.
"As Tom was doing that, it began to rain."
The story got more and more exciting.
Italy is in Europe.
Our teacher is not always kind to us.
Do you have a match?
I am near the station.
You're wasting time.
Men's things are sold on the third floor.
I will do anything that you ask.
I'll show you my room.
I don't like dirty jokes.
They sent me three turkeys.
Sit on the sofa and make yourself comfortable.
"Each individual paid 1,000 dollars."
What're you baking?
The citizens of this small community don't condone public displays of affection.
What happens if I press this button?
Tom isn't bothering me.
No one can resist.
I have a very beautiful dog.
I think I can prove it.
That's why I was absent from school yesterday.
Could you do that?
How many students are there in your school?
I was there last night.
I hope that's enough.
"I won't tell anyone, I promise."
Gasoline isn't cheap anymore.
Tom was a school bus driver before he became a taxi driver.
Tom said he knew where Mary lived.
I think I've had one too many.
"I know you think this is a stupid thing to do, but I plan to do it anyway."
Tom is one of the best workers we have.
I just don't want to go shopping today.
Maybe it will snow.
I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask.
I would like to be an English teacher.
He was not a good politician.
He gave me a half dozen linen handkerchiefs.
Tom had his finger on the trigger.
No one listened to me.
It's been ages since we last met.
Tom expects me to help Mary clean out the clogged pipe.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
Everyone thought we were going to lose.
Tom says that Mary cries all the time.
Our plane took off exactly at 6 p.m.
I wanted to dance.
No one knows her name.
No one's judging you.
Tom asked me to give you this.
"After I closed all the doors, I went to sleep."
I haven't even unpacked my stuff.
Tom cleared his throat.
You're not going to like what I'm about to say.
Why is snow white?
Can you still remember when we first met?
Tom has never really tried very hard to win.
"Tom wants to thank you, too."
I don't have time to be sick.
That's a weird question.
"Consider this a warning, Tom."
Have you written in your diary today?
Tom looks weaker.
She isn't afraid of death.
Have you written to Tom?
Tom didn't tell me Mary was his cousin.
I might have left it on the table.
Tom's Canadian.
Tom slipped back into unconsciousness.
We will fight to the last.
Do you enjoy working from home?
This road connects the two cities.
I've been here way too long.
Tom is generous.
Do you know how to fix this?
Too many children have died.
He shaves four times a week.
I'm very broad-minded.
You're lying.
Tom would never make a mistake like that.
There's a storm coming.
What should I do if I'm attacked by a grizzly bear?
Is it white?
Tom is waiting to see what will happen.
Get those people out of here.
Thanks again for your help.
Can you do this?
The dog nipped at me.
My father took us to the zoo.
I'll afraid this kind of meeting isn't getting us anywhere.
He asked for more money.
"You may be forced to fight, whether you want to or not."
Tom looked over at Mary.
Pandas are beautiful animals.
Tom is just like you.
Tom likes to play with my dog.
I thought for sure you would stay in Japan forever.
My French teacher isn't a Canadian.
The Union soldiers fought fiercely.
Tom has some things that he has to do.
The boy was afraid of the dark.
"You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?"
The meeting started at 2:30 and ended at 5:00.
They stayed friends.
Why didn't you just leave?
I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
Tom is behind in his rent.
They invited me to the party.
The problem was too difficult for me to solve.
Tom is a very strong man.
You won't find this book in any bookstore.
I haven't spoken to Tom yet.
Tom has finally finished doing his homework.
I've got a touch of the flu.
My mother got married at the age of twenty.
I ate nothing but bread and butter.
Let's come up with a new plan.
"If I tell my mother, she'll worry, so I don't think I'll tell her."
I hope you two are hungry.
It happened for a reason.
She was so curious that she opened the box.
Tom opened the window and let in some fresh air.
I may as well go now.
I expect to be back before 2:30.
I want you to go to Osaka at once.
"The next morning, the snowman had completely melted."
I can't leave you here.
No one likes losing.
We took shelter from the rain under a tree.
They can't afford it.
I'm a student.
She gave me a necktie which was completely to my liking.
I never intended to hurt you.
The customs office is at the border.
Look up at the sky.
He began to cry.
"You want to go to Boston with Tom, don't you?"
"My father can swim, but my mother can't."
We don't want to create any new problems.
I like your thinking.
"I'm sure Tom told you Mary wanted to come to the party, too."
I have not seen him for a long time.
Hide the money.
She is as beautiful as her mother.
"The next day, Isabela came back home."
Your friendship means a lot to me.
Do you know when he will come?
This is the dictionary I told you about yesterday.
"You have wanted to go there for a long time, haven't you?"
I must get my watch repaired.
I want to watch television.
"Tom opened a new restaurant, but it didn't turn a profit in the first twelve months."
I'd like a glass of beer.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Tom is very unpredictable.
I interpreted what he said in French into Japanese.
This is holy ground.
He showed an interest in the book.
Will you look after the children?
It's as simple as that.
Nearly a thousand people participated in the demonstration.
I'd like some coffee if you are making some.
It seems that he knows everything.
"Excuse me, but would you please tell me the way to the post office?"
Do you intend to help Tom?
The shop carried leather goods.
I deleted my Facebook account.
Someone made a mistake.
Give me your address.
Tom called Mary from the hotel phone.
I had no idea Tom was a doctor.
I assure you Tom is quite well.
Tom leaned back in his chair.
What type of job are you looking for?
He works like a maniac.
Tom has to go home now.
Did you see the lunar eclipse yesterday?
"Tom was bored, but Mary wasn't."
He's a man you can rely on.
Our dogs were poisoned.
What color do you like?
Tom sat down on the couch.
I'll see you to your car.
My mother lives a lonely life in the country.
Please play it back for me after you've finished the recording.
What do you think about it?
He is leaving Chicago tomorrow.
Take the apple and divide it into halves.
Have you ever seen a car accident?
I even wrote a speech just in case I was asked to give one.
Your hair is too long.
It's good for business.
I like playing basketball.
I'll give you an answer in a day or two.
I was in a bad mood.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
Tom doesn't drink beer at home.
"You've put on weight, haven't you?"
Tom doesn't know for certain what Mary is going to do.
He failed the exam because he had not studied enough.
How much is a pack of cigarettes?
I don't know what could've happened.
Tom walks with a slight limp.
I want to go to Australia with my family.
The students stood waiting for a bus.
You must be kidding!
It seems that our sense of direction is not always reliable.
Would you like to have another cup of tea?
It's just an expression.
The opera starts at seven.
What do you think they'll do?
"It's not just illegal, it's also dangerous."
You don't have to tell that to your parents.
Does this have anything to do with Tom?
I will take care of the flowers.
Tom looked ahead.
You're very good with people.
Don't you think that's a bit strange?
Tom attached the string to the kite.
They went hand in hand.
Do you enjoy it?
She taught rich Indian girls.
I can't put up with the heat any longer.
There's no way Tom can save up enough money in one year to buy a house.
How has your weekend been so far?
You were never in any real danger.
Do you have a fever?
I'll wait here until they come back.
"As strange as it may sound, what Tom said is true."
I cannot read without glasses.
I no longer have a headache.
Tom often goes there.
I'm releasing the prisoners.
What kinds of tropical drinks do you have?
Who translated this poem into the Tajik language?
"Tom pushed the button, but nothing happened."
I thought Tom had something to tell you.
Tom made many mistakes.
He reminds me of his father when he speaks.
He has never played golf.
She's absent because she's sick.
Beware of the dog!
Tom was planning on doing that tomorrow.
I don't know what to do either.
Here you are.
No one is calling you a thief.
I just want you to go away.
Tom said he doesn't know how to speak French.
I can swim very fast.
I'd never say that.
Don't bother me with such trifles.
Can I talk to you for a second please?
How come the sky is blue?
It has my name on it.
They regarded him as the best doctor in town.
Please don't forget to mail the letters.
Tom opened the refrigerator.
I advised him to keep the secret.
There was a shortage of fuel.
Have you ever been married?
Tom said that Mary would likely be willing to help us.
Tom built a birdhouse.
Where are you planning on going this evening?
Tom's impossible.
Drive to the next intersection and make a left turn.
He likes soccer a lot.
Tom and Mary are discussing the situation.
Do you know what it is like to be really hungry?
Maybe you could enlighten me.
Couldn't Tom help?
Do you know how to use chopsticks?
Tom isn't my brother.
You owe me three dollars.
I'll be free tonight.
Those present were almost all women.
The afternoon sun comes directly into my room.
Father laid his hand on my shoulder.
I was surprised when you told me I didn't have to do that.
I sometimes translate lyrics for my wife.
I don't like his way of talking.
"While Tom was away from his desk, Mary drew a caricature of him on the cover of his notebook."
Tom is the man wearing the blue tie.
I'm getting Tom out of here.
Tom is very squeamish and passes out at the sight of blood.
I think my German isn't very good.
Tom made it.
Why do you do what you do?
I'm terribly sorry.
I know a good store that's cheap.
Tom is your enemy.
We need something to eat.
Tom can't stand losing.
Please don't touch the merchandise.
You don't have to make a different dish for every person.
I think about Tom every day.
We're not sure where Tom is.
"According to a recent study, the average life span of the Japanese is still increasing."
He finds faults with everything I do.
That's not up to you.
Tom told me a secret.
He waited his turn.
There was nothing in the box.
Tom has begun looking for a new job.
I managed to get in.
Everybody knows I hate Tom.
Everyone was shocked.
I know a great Italian restaurant on Park Street.
Tom was not impressed.
"Mention Mexico, and tacos come to mind."
Who wrote this poem?
The worst is behind us.
Why do you have two cars?
Do you really want to go back to Boston?
The English alphabet has 26 letters.
I paid about 50 bucks.
It doesn't ring a bell.
He is allergic to house dust.
You cannot have your own way in everything.
Don't look at me.
You probably don't have as much time as I do.
This tree is the same age as that one.
What is the language spoken in Mexico?
Where did you two meet?
They don't know about it.
All you can do is wait.
I'm going to cut right to the chase.
Why was Tom chosen?
They drink a lot of lemonade.
I think Tom and Mary would make a nice couple.
Tom has lots of friends to help him.
Tom's mother packed the picnic basket with sandwiches.
We're like brothers.
Tom gave Mary a dirty look and then left the room.
My neighbor always mows his lawn on Sunday mornings.
I think Tom would like that.
I will help you when I have finished my work.
Tom mowed the front lawn.
Please feed the cat.
We've done what we can.
I talked about music.
He had no difficulty in finding the place.
Could you drive Tom home?
Are you sure you don't want to take a break?
Aren't you going to ask?
He won't be away for long.
Tom handed Mary a book.
I can't remember what question I asked him.
Jesus loves you.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
Can all birds fly?
"Yesterday, I met one of my former teachers."
Tom was fired because he couldn't be trusted.
Sharks are good swimmers.
I haven't heard that joke in ages.
Go kiss someone else.
We'll go on a picnic next Sunday.
Tom opened a window.
Come outside.
"All things considered, she is a fairly good wife."
The news shocked me.
My parents don't want me to get married.
Tom tossed the book on the couch.
"The instant he saw the policeman, he ran away."
About how long will it take?
He acted as our guide.
"I'm sorry, but I have to go home."
Tom is still on the job.

Wait until tomorrow morning.

Tom managed to sell his car for a lot of money.
We have no choice but to go.
You'd better tell me what happened.
What's this got to do with Tom?
"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research, would it?"
She was young.
Tom isn't a lazy child.
We both saw you.
No one knows what to say.
I drank a lot and can't remember much of what happened last night.
There's a rumor going around that you two are dating.
Watch me.
Forgive Tom.
We all agree with you.
That's what I expected of my daughter.
My uncle never writes letters.
This aroused her suspicion.
We went for a walk in the park.
A girl stood there crying.
You should ask for permission first.
I wish Tom would come to Boston.

We've got nothing to hide.
I'm not going to get it.
I feel helpless.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
I like watching TV.

Do I need to set the table?
I've been waiting for you for over a week.
Tom stuck around.
Why don't you put some clothes on?
What's Tom's favorite food?
It has been 200 years since Mozart died.
Can you please watch my bag?
Have you already tried not thinking of anything?

Would you sing us a song in English?
We'll see each other tomorrow in the library.

We'll start.
We are hoping to visit Spain this summer.

Why did you go there?
I hardly see you anymore.
Why did he come here?
I wasn't in a hurry.
Tom broke his promise and didn't help Mary.
Tom could understand what Mary was trying to say.
Tom had his wisdom teeth taken out by a twenty-four year old dentist.
You know better.

Tom can rely on Mary to be on time.
He is a very lazy boy.
The meeting room must be clean.
Did you get a haircut?
Don't make a scene in public.

"It being a fine day, I went out for a walk."
Do you have a points card?

I thought you might have a change of heart.
My grandfather no longer has a driver's license.
Do you believe that there is life after death?
"If you can see your breath when you exhale, you know it's cold."
I needed time to think.
I wrote a book about China.
What time do you close?
Are you going to take part in the next race?
I apologize for Tom's behavior.
Write back to me as soon as you get this letter.
It's not at all typical.
I feel happy.
Tom did it very carefully.
I know I have a lot to learn.
I didn't need to tell him.
That's all I know.
Can I ask you a favor?
You're going to have to pay in advance.
I can't think of anything more depressing than that.
Tom stayed at home because it was raining.
They arrived before you.
I want a chamomile tea.
Watch what you're doing!

I usually eat rice with chopsticks.
You may go.
It was mesmerizing.
He's an oceanographer.
I'm sorry. I'll do anything to make this right.

Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
That sounds terrible.
English is spoken in Canada.
Can you swim at all?
It's not a fish.
I want it.

Check this.

I paid cash for the car.
Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.
I bent over to pick up the pen.
"Pass me the salt, will you?"
Tom lent me the money I needed.
That's not fair.

That's what I want to do.
Perhaps we could do that tomorrow.

Remove that jacket.
"Can I have another beer, please?"
I still love you very much.
Tom knows that Mary doesn't speak French.

Please show me your driver's license.
I think it's worth trying.
You know your stuff.
I can pick you up at the airport if you like.

I'm 25 years old and I've never had a girlfriend.
My uncle has been dead for three years.
I am not missing the point.
You're invited.
Please show me how to use the headset.
My name is Tom.
Tom saw someone.
Tom will never admit that he was wrong.
I know what Tom is doing.
He needs to be the center of attention.
All lawyers are liars.
The boy almost drowned.
I can't make that decision for you.
How long did it take you to translate this book?
It's not good to read in a dark room.
"You don't think you can win, do you?"
I suppose he's got a point.
I wish I could sing as well as you do.
Put on your blinker.
"It's taken us three weeks to fix, but at last our car runs satisfactorily."
Tom just got up and still isn't quite awake.
I have already finished dinner.
"He is my brother, not my father."
You shouldn't smoke so much.
I don't have a credit card.
Call me this evening.
Tom couldn't resist peeking through the keyhole.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
All you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
You work too much.
Don't let your personal feelings get in the way of your work.
I can't see anything from here.
She woke him up.
Did you clean your room today?
Tom calls Mary up every night.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
Do you know who sings that song?
Where did you learn to dance like this?
She shivered at the sight.
You're a good girl.
I didn't understand any of that.
I saw the way you were looking at each other.
My aunt had three children.
I love the woods.
You'd better eat something.
Tom told Mary he had a lot of money.
Take care of this.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Tom put his hat on and went outside.
Can you play guitar?
Tom is a picky eater and seldom tries anything new.
Don't worry. The ambulance will be here soon.
Tom became a taxi driver.
Tom picked Mary up at the station.
It's regrettable.
Tom only washes his hair once a week.
I am online.
She told us the road was closed.
She'll love him forever.
Count from one to a hundred.
We'll eat lunch together at 12:30.
The people here are accustomed to the cold.
Could you tell me how to get to the ballpark?
I can't afford a camera as good as yours.
Where do we start looking?
Tom never fully appreciated that.
Tom dated Mary for three years.
What floor do you live on?
Tom climbed up onto the roof.
I think you should work a little harder.
My father is an early riser.
I collect comics.
Stop showing off!
I wonder how Tom will ever manage to pay for such an expensive wedding.
I can't believe that someone who's supposed to be my friend would say things like that about me.
That guy is always asking his parents for money.
The train is 30 minutes overdue.
I want to visit Cuba before Castro dies.
Is Tom delirious?
We stored the hay in the barn.
You promised.
Tom practiced hard to make the team.
The room was locked.
That's not how we think.
Are there any questions?
I had a problem similar to that not too long ago.
She should know better at her age.
"Far from being a failure, it was a great success."
He came out from where he was hiding.
Tom is shorter than his brother.
Tom ate dinner about one hour ago.
Do you want to resign?
Are you through with the book?
The important thing is that you're alive.
Take what you like.
Tom is a very rich person.
What makes you think Tom does that?
"You can't understand this sentence, can you?"
Tom woke up in the hospital.
You'll lose everything.
Why did you only stop the foreigners?
Tom scratched his neck.
She lost both her parents.
Tom put his hand on Mary's.
Nobody tells me anything.
"How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?"
What'll happen?
Someone should tell Tom that the meeting was canceled.
Do you have a cell phone?
Tom and Mary are much stronger than we are.
I'm glad I hired you.
Tom is inclined to be moody and is not easy to live with.
Mary batted her eyelashes at Tom.
Tom was behaving like a spoiled child.
You should carry out your duty.
We can't ignore Tom.
I don't do those things.
"Aside from Tom, I don't know anyone there."
I'll rip your head off!
We'll meet again.
Tom is certain to come on time.
This is something to consider.
It would've been so easy.
No one has the right to treat you like this.
She is a quiet woman.
Some voters waited hours to vote.
"Tom is there, isn't he?"
You've got nothing to worry about.
It was a race to get to the station on time.
Cats don't like getting wet.
Where are you sitting now?
Tom is very interested in learning French.
I want to know why you lied.
I was busy all day.
He made up his mind to marry her.
I'd like an honest answer.
Hello everyone!
I had a nightmare.
Her silence seemed to confirm suspicions that she was hiding something.
Tom has lost interest in studying French.
She is having lunch now.
I have read the book before.
Get Tom out of here.
I never heard him lie.
"You're not sleepy, are you?"
Tom hugged the stuffed animal.
The x-ray showed two broken fingers.
I'm the one who should be doing that.
You've had your fun.
Tom seemed to be illiterate.
I go to a restaurant once in a blue moon.
When do we have to do that?
I met her at the church.
You must tell Tom the truth.
Tom did his homework and then went to bed.
This is a real surprise.
How many bags do you have?
What's the best way to say this in French?
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I'm still not married.
It'll be quicker to walk than to take a taxi.
May I have this book?
Do you really care that much?
Something tells me I should've said no.
You don't look very well. Are you sick?
"If you want to go to the art museum, take this bus."
The house was empty except for a cat.
Where are your clothes?
Tom did nothing illegal.
Tom went skiing.
I'm going to buy a pack of cigarettes.
Have you ever slipped on a banana peel?
I am a twin.
It was clear that Hawking would live longer than was first thought.
What happened was worse than anything Tom had imagined would happen.
How long have we been friends?
He tore the photographs into pieces.
Tom was nosy.
Please forgive me for not having written for a long time.
This is Tom's room.
Tom had nothing to do yesterday.
Would one of you please tell me where I can park my car?
I won't go under any circumstances.
You tried.
He doesn't want to get involved.
She failed to appear.
How do I do it?
Tom knows the capital of each state in the United States.
Tom taught Mary how to defend herself.
Tom is a natural athlete.
Tom doesn't know what Mary does for a living.
French has many more vowels than Japanese.
I can't believe Tom did this to me.
They don't always obey their parents.
"Tom promised to come, but he hasn't turned up yet."
I don't ever go there anymore.
I got all choked up when I heard the voice of Ryo over the telephone.
It was a stupid bet.
I think we should all be worried a little bit about the way Tom has been acting lately.
Are you coming with us?
Would you mind if I took a break?
My parents let me go there.
Have you decided who you're going to invite to your birthday party?
He confessed his guilt.
You should eat more.
"If you are to succeed, you must try harder."
The time is nine minutes after ten.
Tom has an evil twin brother.
She's much happier than him.
Tom lost the watch that Mary gave him.
Tom got into his car and drove off.
I can't be without you.
I can read your thoughts.
You know how they are.
Does Tom have one?
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't go there by herself.
I never drink alone.
A truck was standing in the middle of the road.
Beer contains hops.
I'm going in first.
I'd rather not go out today.
I carefully took down everything that my teacher said.
Tom has been following me around.
I'm willing to give it a try.
Tom turned on the faucet.
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
The other team has some really good players.
I don't like this weather.
"As for myself, Saturday will be convenient."
What do you want to hear from me?
Don't be rude.
"When I was a child, I could sleep anywhere."
Tom was sitting three tables away from us.
The apartment was furnished in the Victorian style.
What did you want to show me?
This car is like new.
I didn't know he had decided to leave his job.
Wash your hands before meals.
A kiss without a mustache is like an egg without salt.
Have you paid your phone bill?
Tell me what we're doing here.
"Money isn't everything, but if you have no money, you can't do anything."
I've started dating again.
How did you come to know this?
Yours is over there.
Tom took me to a nice restaurant.
I cut myself with a hacksaw.
Have you already told Tom about what happened to Mary?
It's not like I don't want to do it.
You can't help Tom.
Tom appreciated Mary's kindness.
Don't be a wet blanket.
Did you watch the game?
Do Japanese people eat sushi every day?
Go and wake Tom up.
The cup has a crack.
Tom doesn't like speaking in public.
I have to take my son to the doctor.
Tom started to untie his shoes.
Tom was teased because he looked different from the other children.
It is too difficult a problem for me to solve.
Don't make an enemy of Tom.
Tom has been expecting Mary.
"If you don't want to say anything, you don't have to."
I'll prove it to you.
It made me supremely happy.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
My father smokes.
Tom is exactly three weeks old.
Tofu can be used as a substitute for meat.
The lawyer's fee was very high.
OK. I agree.
It's as good as finished.
Tom almost never wears a hat.
I don't like your dog.
"Don't fail me, Tom."
Tom lives only an hour away.
Tom and Mary will be celebrating their thirtieth wedding anniversary on Monday.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate that.
Tom had the whole place to himself.
I would like to drink a coffee.
The Republican candidate won the election.
They sent my suitcase to London by mistake.
There was only one problem.
It's gradually getting colder.
You've got a nice smile.
Everything he's saying is slander.
I felt the engine running.
Is there some reason why Tom isn't here today?
Tom and Mary have found something.
Tom is younger than your daughter.
Tom is patient.
Do not try to imitate her.
I heard you talking.
Tom didn't know what to do first.
Is your watch correct?
Tom talks about Boston a lot.
He always shows great determination in everything he undertakes.
We've got to leave early.
I trust Tom more than Mary.
"Last year, I spent so much time by myself that I almost forgot how to communicate effectively with others."
A fast walker can walk six kilometers in an hour.
I want Tom to look at me.
This is news to me.
I promise I won't say anything to anybody.
Some believe Nessie lives in this lake.
I barely escaped being hit by the truck.
We can't change what has happened.
It's out of the question.
Are you busy tomorrow afternoon?
Will you come to the party tomorrow?
Tom spent thirty years in prison.
They greeted us warmly.
"Tom retired October 20, 2013."
"I told the children to be quiet, but they just kept on being noisy."
Tom handed Mary something.
How many hours a day do you study French?
I'm really glad you decided to come.
You've done a good job here.
I've never seen so many books in one place.
Are you a new student?
How did he take the news?
The trouble is that we are short of money.
I just can't get along with him.
What games do you have?
The hunting dogs followed the scent of the fox.
There isn't anything down here.
I've got more.
You should have accepted his advice.
Tom must be well off.
Feel free to leave comments below.
Tom is one of our best detectives.
Do you have any pets?
"Since it was late at night and I was very tired, I stayed at an inn."
Tom is coming here.
Good evening.
Tom's right eye is twitching again.
We'll shoot.
You are not allowed to turn left on this street.
We have to go to school.
Where is my car?
Tom worked his way through college.
I wonder what time it is.
I acted as a simultaneous interpreter.
I would like to be a pilot in the future.
Tom took a folded piece of paper out of his pocket.
Tom is one of the most talented people I know.
I thought I heard the door open.
Can you walk?
We import flour from America.
He doesn't listen.
I want to be with you more than anything.
I think Tom should be home with his children.
Tom has flat feet.
"I asked you a question. ""I didn't hear you."""
How much money do you have?
You aren't allowed in here.
We could see the sunset from the window.
We had nothing better to do.
The demonstration at City Hall started getting out of hand.
Have you always been a comedian?
He is good at driving.
This wall feels cold.
I am interested in the cello and the piano.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't disagree.
Tom's researched his family history and intends to send a detailed family tree to all of his relatives.
The class was divided into four groups.
"Hello, I'm Tom."
The thief ran away and the policeman ran after him.
Tom was the oldest person in the room.
Must I hurry?
Tom is too trusting.
This book cost me a fortune.
I love cake.
What prevented him from coming?
Do you drink beer?
Who's your teacher?
I'll take them to Tom.
Tom needs your attention.
I'm afraid I can't talk about that.
I wish we could live here.
They were forced to withdraw.
Mary rarely wears dresses.
What happened to you last night?
Tom looked at the speedometer.
What are you into these days?
He will come this afternoon.
Tom doesn't eat meat.
I'm willing to accept your offer.
The next concert will take place in June.
Did the union participate in the demonstration?
He took advantage of my ignorance and deceived me.
What is it you're doing?
"After three drinks, the man passed out."
I suggest we all calm down.
No one knows.
The bus stop is across the street.
He broke up the chair for firewood.
I was awfully confused by his question.
I just want a little more coffee.
Could you repeat that?
Tom's fever is getting worse.
That's why Tom is still there.
I'm not like Tom.
I told Tom to study harder.
These things aren't mine!
I'm not your brother.
Please help Tom.
They lost.
Tom is a stubborn person.
You have to take the first step.
I like spring.
Did you find anything else?
What vegetables do you usually grow?
They're not coming back.
Don't talk about people behind their backs.
My father has been busy.
Easy does it.
I love him more than any of the other boys.
"If you leave now, you'll get there on time."
They have announced their engagement.
We'll be home all day tomorrow.
They've forgiven me.
What are they going to do?
I almost forgot to do my homework.
Isn't that the most humane punishment for criminals?
Mary is very impressed.
Do you know how they knew?
Tom hesitated.
That's enough for today. I'm tired.
He is unable to do it.
Tom stayed up past his usual bedtime.
Who made this box?
Tom can get it.
Maybe Tom killed himself.
Children should only speak when they're spoken to.
"You're with Tom, aren't you?"
You have to go whether you like it or not.
The water is nice and cool.
I don't have to listen to you.
My sister sang an English song at the party.
The farmers didn't know what to do.
"I live near her house, but I seldom see her."
Tom pushed open the bedroom door.
Let's take a bus.
I have lost my new fountain pen.
You are very kind to show me the way.
Tom was fatally injured.
The floor is very slippery.
How did Tom get you to help him clean the garage?
I imagined my first kiss would be more romantic.
I can't stand kids.
You are crazy to lend money to him.
What else do we need to talk about?
I am watching an old film.
I cannot stop him.
"Where have you been, young lady?"
I am speechless.
"Instead of going ashore, we stayed on the ship."
Tom has three cameras.
Go to the park.
This book is too difficult for me to read.
It's really embarrassing.
She liked that.
I heard you scream.
A plastic bag can take up to a thousand years to disintegrate.
I don't think this old car will make it to the top of the hill.
Why are we even talking about this?
Tom spent the night on the couch.
The train was delayed for two hours because of the heavy snow.
"I don't know how, but you did it."
I'll give him a buzz.
I'll be late to work.
I want to go to the movies today.
Don't worry about it!
The last thing I want to do is cause you any problems.
It's your bedtime.
You are quite a man.
Fry an egg for me.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
That's a nice T-shirt.
I can't give you any more details at this time.
Tom doesn't look anything like his brother.
We're not doing that again.
I have nothing else scheduled for today.
I'm always forgetting people's names.
Here is my key.
How's the family?
Tom thinks outside the box.
It's going to happen sooner or later.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
I would like to be an English teacher.
I want a lot.
My brother is good at playing tennis.
You can't be everyone's friend all the time.
She refused to eat her lunch.
I'm not asking for money.
He knows how to read Chinese.
The stable is right behind the farm house.
The birds in the cage are canaries.
How do you choose which projects to do?
I read all kinds of books.
What's Tom wearing?
Tom said that he doesn't want a promotion.
He knows many folk dances.
There is a sewing machine and an ironing board in the room where Tom used to sleep.
Your suitcases are over there.
"I had an appointment at 2:30, but I got caught in traffic and couldn't get there in time."
Tom likes to drink.
Who are you to talk to me like that?
He kept me waiting on purpose.
What kind of flowers do you like?
"You're new, aren't you?"
Many children die of starvation in Africa.
I do love you.
We are going to climb that mountain.
How much are these shoes?
The little boy is used to talking with grown-ups.
Tom is always breaking things.
You can go there in a boat.
Do what he tells you.
This shouldn't take too long.
Please feed the dog.
You must think for yourself.
That didn't work.
Please don't mumble.
Don't be so sure.
That cannot be denied.
"I must have tried on everything in the shop, but nothing looked right on me."
This is our only chance.
"Tom stood motionless, listening carefully."
I don't know her address.
The boy washing the car is my brother.
His performance left nothing to be desired.
I only had a cursory look at it.
My watch loses three minutes a week.
It's a lovely day.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
I filled up the vase with water.
Did you know that?
Tom and Mary don't get along. They have nothing in common.
I have never heard him lie.
We know why you came here.
Quit acting like a baby.
He married my cousin.
What a great idea!
Tom might be innocent.
Do you prefer subtitled or dubbed TV shows?
How long were you in Boston?
I think you're in my seat.
"No matter who you ask, you won't be able to get a satisfactory answer."
You always destroy everything.
He is accountable to the management for what he does.
I was hoping to find you here.
What did you go to Kyoto for?
I want you to tell me the truth.
What's with Tom?
I want to know why you lied.
"If you want to yell at someone, yell at me."
I was worried about you all day.
Tom knew he couldn't win.
Will we be in time for the concert?
Shut up and do as you're told.
Tom asked Mary whether she planned to swim or not.
There wasn't anyone in the room.
Tom tried to hide his nervousness.
I'm the bad one.
What do I owe you?
Tom assured Mary that he'd help her paint the ceiling of her kitchen.
Who's that?
It's not easy to get here by public transportation.
This kind of specialized knowledge has very little to do with daily life.
I don't consider myself to be good-looking.
I admit that he is right.
That's a little weird.
Is there any danger of radiation?
Tom found a good place for me live.
Where're Tom's things?
Don't ever touch me.
Tom is one of Mary's favorite students.
Tom lives alone in the woods.
I'm really old.
Your time is running out.
I've never been good at singing.
I took your word for it.
I bought a new suit.
Tom never got an award.
A cat came out from under the desk.
The bus was heading north.
This bus will take you to the museum.
Tom is Mary's cousin.
Your new hair style makes you look older.
"It's fine to set up a web page, just be sure you don't infringe anybody's copyright."
Please don't speak so fast.
Do I sound in love?
"Tom is a little unusual in that he doesn't drink tea, coffee or beer."
You can't let Tom get away with telling lies about you.
"Do you have 5,000 yen you could lend me?"
My living room has wide windows.
He was afraid of making the first move.
Tom isn't in a joking mood.
She spends a lot of money on shoes.
It's very cold here.
"We are the same age, but different heights."
I'm happy the game is over.
This car is in good condition.
Where's my invite?
We watched the soccer game on TV.
Have you lost the receipt?
"No matter what he may say, don't trust him."
Do you think Tom has a drug problem?
I had my bicycle stolen.
Everyone admired his courage.
How long have you had this problem?
The boys are excited.
We're honeymooning.
"If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me."
What were Tom and Mary thinking?
Tom understands me.
Tom took the bottle from Mary and looked at the label.
I hope you get well soon.
I was hardly able to see it.
Don't ask me that again.
Would you like to order?
Tom wasn't here when I came in.
I'm having a hard time with French grammar.
There is an album on the shelf.
Tom is always up-to-date with the latest news.
He's stronger than you.
Stop!
It was just a joke.
I'm taking Tom to the park.
Tom is a brave person.
I don't want to go up there.
She played a tune on the piano.
"Aside from that, is there anything else you want?"
I'm sure Tom is exaggerating.
Tom sent a video to Mary.
Napoleon's horse was white.
Why should I pay?
She speaks English really well.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I was told that you could teach me how to sharpen a knife.
"Tom looks young, doesn't he?"
Tom and Mary were inseparable when they were children.
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
We all have to contribute.
I thought I told you I didn't want you to do that anymore.
Tom somewhat resembles his father.
This is too short.
I am the happiest man on earth.
I got some money for my birthday.
He is engaged to my younger sister.
Tom will call you later.
We agreed on 2:30.
Tom's apartment is a real mess.
Tom loves his job.
You're sitting too close to the TV.
He sells fruit.
Philosophy is not a thing one can learn in six months.
I have courage and a strong will.
I hate fluorescent lights.
They tied the thief to the tree.
Tom certainly had a point when he said we should allow more time to complete the project.
I've seen your record.
Barley and wheat grow in the fields around the village.
I was just daydreaming.
"Hey, you're not Tom."
Tom is still waiting outside.
All brides are beautiful on their wedding days.
Tom can spell better than Mary.
Tom won't ever forget what happened today.
The population of this city has decreased.
I don't mean you.
I am not going anywhere on Sunday.
Tom lives on the other side of the valley.
The rock feels wet.
What're you doing for Christmas?
Tom didn't have time to finish his report.
The train came on time.
She has never danced with him.
I can stay in the guest room.
Tom was helpless.
It just didn't work.
I'm so glad you're home.
How many times a day do you look at yourself in the mirror?
Everybody wanted me to do it.
"He may be clever, but he is not very helpful."
What good would that do?
I came by to say hi.
My patience has run out.
"Please speak a little slower, Tom."
Tom said that he would come.
"If Tom is right, Mary is in Boston now."
Who is the manager of that baseball team?
I love walking on the beach.
The spell was broken and the pig turned into a man.
Most accidents happen near home.
Please show me your picture.
I met Tom tonight.
Our team did very well.
Tom said we should rehearse more.
That sounds funny to me.
What's wrong with them?
The population of Tokyo is larger than that of Osaka.
Show him in.
Tom is flustered.
He had the ambition to be prime minister.
Don't go out after dark.
Did you threaten Tom?
Thank you for calling me back.
"Tom began to sing ""Happy Birthday."""
Tom visited us yesterday.
"If you heard her speak English, you would take her for an American."
You're wealthy.
My upper right wisdom tooth hurts.
Cigarette smoke bothers me a lot.
Tom wants Mary to buy a new dress for the banquet.
Tom has a car.
The picture was painted by Picasso.
It was childish of him to behave like that.
I want an MP3 player!
She wears her hair in a bun.
It will soon be September.
It really works.
He's at church right now.
Tom denied that he was the thief.
The man ran away.
Do you actually feel sorry for Tom?
Mary is a country girl.
Tom has been retired for twenty years.
I wondered why people were staring at me.
Tom was devious.
Don't even think about it.
Come into the room after me.
He'll be married next Sunday.
Get away!
She was reluctant to reveal her secret.
She is good at speaking English.
Everyone looked at Tom again.
Tom will shoot.
Tom was entranced by Mary's singing.
He is a real gentleman.
I thought it was a bad dream.
I love living in Boston.
The sky has become overcast.
Take off your jacket.
Can you prove it?
You can't pick who you fall in love with.
He opened a can of worms.
How long has Tom been living in Boston?
Can you deliver that?
It could be a hoax.
The theory is too abstract for me.
My sister jogs every day.
Have you ever been stung by a scorpion?
I said I'd get it.
It's already dark.
"Paris, which is on the Seine, is a beautiful city."
The drunken man couldn't walk straight.
We can't just ignore this.
Tom walked in the door at just the right time.
Tom saw nothing.
I can't buy a car.
I know sign language.
Tom took a flower out of the vase while no one was looking.
Tom wanted to keep working.
I'll give it to Tom.
Allow yourself to make mistakes.
Maybe it will snow.
Your problem is you're not motivated.
I was invited to lunch.
Tom and Mary were kissing each other when I walked in.
Why don't you just relax and have fun?
My grandpa was an avid collector of stamps.
His disappointment was obvious to everyone.
Tom can't work tomorrow.
He bought that house because his wife liked it.
Tom will come for sure.
I'm happy with it.
I'll get to it.
You stink.
You can't just give up.
The refugees barely escaped death.
I can't remember his name.
How shall we deal with this matter?
I'm sure Tom loves you.
"A few years ago, there was a huge scandal."

How much should I tip?
Be careful that you don't get lost.
Let's see what happens.
She patted me on the shoulder.
We'll talk afterwards.
Tom attended Mary's funeral.
Is there anything else we need to do?
The night was cool.
We're not young anymore.
My lips are sealed.
Why are men so stupid?
"That's what you want, isn't it?"
Tom went into his room and slammed the door.
This is my question.
Tell me where to go next.
I'm getting used to eating alone.
This is usually unnecessary.

That's how we did it.
I've never been in love before.
He has a test next week.
I like fruits such as oranges and apples.
I don't really know why.

She raised her hand to ask a question.
He never lies.
Tom went running.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.

Who did what?

Tom is incredibly good.
Maybe it never happened.
He's an outlaw.
Tom was selected.
Tom is neither rich nor famous.
I don't speak French as often as I used to.
They all look the same.
What do you want to hear?
I think Tom went out last night.
Why are you getting so upset?
Who could you do that with?
I'll show you what I can do.
"If you eat too much, you will get fat."
Tom took a short cut.
Are you tall?
Tom wanted to turn the page.
I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.

These boots belong to her.
I'm glad to see you.
I'll be back soon.
Tom doesn't have many photos of himself as a baby.

It began to rain toward evening.
That man is Tom.
He sells cars.
You must've misunderstood.
Tom didn't use to be like that.

You can do whatever you want to.
Do you have any objections?
Who told you I was Canadian?
"You don't live here, do you?"
The river that flows through London is the Thames.

Are you from Australia?
It's the sort of work that calls for a high level of concentration.

Is he a teacher?
The truth is that I don't really love you anymore.

I'm surprised at you.
Do you think that's possible?
I'm not used to making speeches in public.

The movie starts in thirty minutes.
Smoking is harmful to your health.
Tom wanted to know what had happened.
We still have a lot of time.
I need a box about this big.
Seemingly impossible things sometimes happen.
I imagine that Tom will eventually give up and let someone else do it.
That's terrible.
I can't help feeling something's not quite right.
"When you're done with the book, put it back where you found it."
I think Tom is here already.

I didn't know what to do next.
Tom rushed into his office and slammed the door.
"You're used to that, aren't you?"
"There's no point talking to you, because you won't do as I say anyway."
His pride didn't allow him to ask for help.
Why does everything happen to me?
Tom doesn't know the difference between a fable and a fairytale.
"If he finds out, certainly he will be very angry."

Can you remember anything?
The police are investigating the murder.
Tom never thought he'd see Mary again.
Would you be so kind as to shut that window?
He can run faster than I can.
Why didn't I think of it myself?
Where would you like to go next?
None of this would've happened if we'd been more careful.
Tom was here today asking for help.
I really have to go now.

Tom is the cutest boy in the class.
"That wasn't so bad, was it?"
Tom helped Mary up off the floor.
The school was established in 1650.
Where did you get to know her?
"If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand."
Watch out for cars when you cross the street.
You can't leave me like this.
Watch closely.
It's easy for her to make friends.
Tom was nervous.
Where should we meet?
I don't like rice.
It's very dangerous.
I wrote a love letter last night.
We were all so scared.
You should've heard Tom sing. He was really good.
Tom is happy.
Don't beat about the bush.
"A committee is a group of people who individually can do nothing, but who, as a group, can meet and decide that nothing can be done."

This is a waterproof watch.
"If you are to succeed, you must try harder."
It's not that interesting.
When did you get back home?
I don't like the way Tom cooks vegetables.
Where shall I wait for you?
I spent the entire weekend in the library studying.
It's bad for business.
What would Tom say if he walked in right now?
Tom is impartial.
My mother died when I was a kid.
The water is cold.
How could he possibly think that would work?
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
Do you know how to do it?
Tom didn't let on that he knew about the surprise party.
They took our passports.
The cake didn't turn out well because the flour was past its use-by date.
People sometimes make illogical decisions.
The law is the law.
"We don't want this to get damaged, do we?"
What should I do?
Tom wants a new bicycle.
They can't stop me.
May I come aboard?
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
I often break things when I'm angry.
There are a couple of parks not too far from my house.
Did Tom oversleep?
"Up to now, we've never had this problem."
How did we get into so much trouble?
That sounds a lot easier to do than it is.
What's the next station?
He invested his money in stocks.
Tom's mother's name is Mary.
They regarded the man as a danger to society.
Is Mary prettier than me?
I wish we'd done that.
He hates shopping.
The attempt failed.
I wish that I could speak French as well as Tom.
It will be finished in a day or two.
I'm not leaving until tomorrow.
Please don't tell anybody.
You can see the sea on your right.
"You never told me that! ""Yes, I did!"""
Tom got very angry with Mary.
The ship will arrive by five o'clock.
Don't compare yourself with your brother because he's a better man than you.
I never imagined I'd be working for you.
Show me another bag.
Don't forget.
"You know where Tom is, don't you?"
I want to talk to you about something.
This is a very rare case.
Mary can dance well.
Does Tom have to do that?
I don't have a nickname.
I had two dogs.
The prime minister appoints the members of his cabinet.
Try on that shirt.
He visited a friend.
I don't like to go out without a coat on such a cold day.
Aiding and abetting the enemy is considered treason.
Make sure you don't forget to apologize.
I'm confused. What do I do now?
He tore the book apart.
I gave up on Tom.
Do you have a roll of toilet paper?
That child put his playthings away.
Will you do me a favor?
Can I pick my ticket up at the airport?
Many questions came up about the quality of the new product.
Tom sat listening.
Tom followed Mary into John's office.
He was shivering from the cold.
When did you last talk to Tom?
"Today, automobiles have taken the place of horses as the principal means of transportation."
I regard him as an enemy.
"If you stuff the box too full, the bottom will fall out."
We have to use the stairs because the elevator is out of order.
Try not to forget anything.
"Could I have the bill, please?"
The train arrived on schedule.
"Each person paid $7,000."
There's a lot of money involved.
I prefer to eat alone.
That wouldn't be fair.
Tom never asked me to do that.
That bag is mine.
I want to thank you for all your help.
Have you told Tom why you don't like him?
I don't believe half of what I've been told about you.
Have you told her mother?
He's smart.
You don't understand me.
Tom lost custody of his children.
I sure hope you're right.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
It took me three hours to do my homework.
The sun is starting to go down.
President Roosevelt agreed to help.
I have two brothers and a sister.
"Open the window, please."
Why didn't you do anything?
Please take a seat.
Could you put this coat somewhere?
Tom had an anxiety attack.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
I know you're not serious.
Her dog isn't very fast.
Remember to brush your teeth.
Let me have another look at that.
Do you want me to go now?
Tom must be wrong.
I went to the airport by taxi.
I go to bed about ten.
Don't open the door.
Tom said that he'll go home as soon as he finishes doing what he's doing.
May I call on you some day?
Look what we've found.
Mary was burned at the stake.
Tom is obviously infatuated with Mary.
There are a million people in Auckland.
I'm not going to tell you where Tom is.
Do you drink alcohol?
It's not my business.
How did you come by those rare books?
It was an unfortunate accident.
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
"I want to be your ally, not your enemy."
Luckily nobody drowned.
I remember seeing him.
Tom speaks French better than me.
The cool air felt wonderful on my face.
Tom can run fast.
Tom gave Mary three dollars and John thirty dollars.
There's a pay phone over there.
I found the game easy.
"I have plenty of time, but not enough money."
I'll make you what you want.
This is very easy.
"No matter what happens, I am prepared."
His son had been killed in a duel.
He's going to regret this.
We complement each other.
Are you really that stupid?
He admired his friend's work.
We overlooked Tom's name when we sent out invitations.
The man stood up.
I don't have any brothers.
How can I manage to finish on time?
He was distracted by the beautiful girl.
None of us plan to do that.
Tom returned to his room and closed the door.
You don't understand anything.
Thanks for helping out.
Are you still thinking that you'd like the job?
Call me immediately after you meet him.
Tom said that he loves me and wants to marry me.
It's been three years since we got married.
Who do we see about that?
The hill on which my house stands commands a full view of the city.
"Who helped you? ""Tom did."""
A fish leaped out of the water.
He was lying on the couch.
I know it for a fact.
Let's learn this poem by heart.
We can stay here for as long as our supplies of food and water hold out.
Would you like to have some tea?
Tom promised me that he would come back.
"One of the cats is black, the other is brown."
Have you decided who you're going to invite?
It's the largest in the world.
Do you know how to grind beef?
I never asked for this.
I think that we should try again.

How are you today?
Is anybody here?
He's out of town on business.

I didn't say that.
Greedy people always want more stuff.

Tom goes jogging every morning.
Tom is in his late thirties.
That's what I like.
I'm not nervous.
It's hit or miss.
Tom found a nice apartment for me.
He came home late in the evening.
You didn't have to lie.
"Tom is still homeless, isn't he?"
I'm not good at expressing my feelings.
He's my half-brother.
It all seems pointless.
We were supposed to tell everyone to leave.
Why'd you do that?

I don't want to get my hair cut.
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go outside and play.
"Can I have another beer, please?"
Let Tom do this.
"Do you understand me, Tom?"
I asked Tom where he'd been.
He is a student at Yushu High School.
Tom retired when he was 65.
My bicycle was stolen.
Tom's boss demands a lot of work.
Just follow them.
A nod is a sign of agreement.
"Hello, how's business?"
Do you want to go somewhere else?
You obviously don't know Tom very well.
You are as white as a sheet.
You said you could play the piano.
I think Tom is lying.
What are Tom's true intentions?
I read the report carefully.
Can you come?
Please send an ambulance.
You were shouting at her and I don't like that.
Where did you find your key?
What can be more important than that?

That's what I love about you.
I recognized him at first glance.

Where are you going exactly?
I'm so happy you could make it.
Keep out.
Why is everyone crying?
We set up the tent next to the river.
I don't mind.
Tom has had three glasses of wine already.
Why don't you study French?
The problem was being discussed by the committee.
How can you tell Tom isn't happy?
She isn't running.
Homicide is punishable by death.
I want to visit South Korea.
I love jokes.

Where's the nearest subway station?
They began to run when they saw the police.
He was really impressed.

Do you have a pencil?
Can you recommend any other hotels?
Don't you realize your behavior reflects on all of us?
The ship was at the mercy of the storm.
I missed the school bus!

Go for help.
Tom is much better at French than me.
"To put it bluntly, he's mistaken."
There's an easier way to do it.
We exchanged glances with each other.
I just want you to know that Tom is safe.
You must do it this way.
I'm hungry and thirsty.
Dinner will be ready by six-thirty.
"I haven't read ""War and Peace"" either."
That computer has a quad-core processor.
I hope you're doing well.
What do you want to know that for?
It's raining where I am.
Maybe Tom can help us figure out how to solve this problem.
He cannot be trusted.
Tom's locker is next to Mary's.
She has seven sons.
He was welcomed everywhere.
She left the kitchen with the kettle boiling.
Why do you always do that to me?
This box is too heavy for me to carry.

Tom is unbiased.
I don't know what's wrong with you today.
I realized I needed help.
I hear my father was as old as I am now when he came up to Tokyo.

Where do you want this?
Don't go yet.
Tom rang the doorbell.
It has to be ready by the fifteenth.

What have we overlooked?
He is sure to succeed in the attempt.

Go over it again.
I like your car.
Is the exhibit open to the public?
I didn't want to come here.
What relation is she to you?
"If Tom had asked Mary for advice first, he wouldn't have had this problem."
I was awake.
My guess is that Tom isn't going to want that.
I don't want Tom to know that right now.
You'll need a special tool to do it.
I want to know if you'll be free tomorrow.
You're too inflexible.
Tom was fast asleep.
Nobody can help you.
We will do anything for you.
You should wash your car.
You are still sick. You have to stay in bed.
They are my brothers.

When was the last time you spoke with Tom?
Tom and Mary make an odd pair.
What have you done?
You're untrustworthy.
I've been alone for a long time.

I get asked that question a lot.
Debtors are people who cannot re-pay money they owe.
Tom enjoys playing the piano.
Tom may do that here.
May I borrow this book?

I learned quite a bit.
Tom laughed out loud when he saw Mary's outfit.
Tom started reading self-help books after his divorce.
Don't go off without saying good-by.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

I'm satisfied with everything.
You can't handle it.
Do you like the apartment?
What should Tom do?
Do I look like I'm having fun?
Does the term self-preservation mean anything to you?

Do your best!
I wanted to help you.
That could happen to anyone.
It's past your bedtime.
You learn fast.
Aren't you going to bed?
Who fell?

Have you ever been betrayed by a good friend?
It's just a toy with no practical use.
I don't want to hurt you.
"You heard what Tom said, didn't you?"
You are not a coward.
This is where I spend most of the day.
This is not a coincidence.
Enjoy your holidays.

Keep writing.
The good news is that we can get in free.

I want to go to school in Australia.
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
Tom is really big.
I don't know when he's coming.

Where is the library?
Doing that wouldn't have changed anything.
I can't stand hospitals.
He likes reading books.
Oranges are rich in vitamin C.
I have three times as many books as he does.
Tom knows where to go to get the best prices.
Can you handle it?
You can reach me at this number.
I don't think I've heard that word in a long time.
Tom has to help Mary.
Don't whistle at school.
I need to ask you some questions.
Is he satisfied with his daily life?

I can't talk about that right now.

Tom really needs your help.
How many times have I told you to fold your clothes?

She's my oldest friend. I've known her since kindergarden.
"I'll never forget what happened on October 20, 2013."
The waitress set a glass of juice in front of me.
I am leaving at ten o'clock.

Keep away from that.
"Tom lives in Boston, too."
I saw that coming.

Should I come with you?
Are you free this weekend?
Do you want to tell me what this is?
You're welcome to come along.
I know that already.
That's a question no one knows the answer to.

I don't want sugar.
That white parasol is hers.
How'd you do it?
You can't miss it.

I think you're mistaken.
This is Tom.
I just wanted to see you again.
Tom won't come to today's meeting.
I'm sure you did your best.
There's someone hiding in the closet.
Tom is capable of doing it.

I have everything I need.
You're not Canadian.
Tom knows you can't speak French very well.
I can't watch.
Did you close the window?
You're the best sister in the whole world.
That a boy!
He turned over the business to his son.
I'm good with people.
Tom answered my question.
"Just because you can, doesn't mean that you should."
We plan to drink champagne at midnight.
Use your instincts.
Let's wait here till he comes back.
The evening meal is served between 9 and 12.
I don't want to see you again.
Why are you in such a hurry?

Tom and Mary often play tennis together.
That color doesn't look good on me.
Am I being fired?
Tom is a shy and lonely boy.
It is difficult for me to answer the question.
Can you play a song for me?
She is more of an acquaintance than a friend.
I won't be back for a while.
I can't risk that.

We're in a library.
They're no good.
Tom said he couldn't breathe.
What happens if we get caught?
The spectators in the gallery were making a lot of noise.
Tom asked Mary a rather difficult question.
She bought him a camera.
I wonder if he is married.

The report has not been confirmed yet.
He admitted his guilt.
Tom has been doing a lot of thinking.
Tom read a lot.

That's what they don't understand.

Tom left without saying goodbye.
A book can be compared to a friend.

Please throw the ball.
This isn't fair.
It was not an accident.
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
Read it aloud.
I work every day except Sunday.
There were two cakes.
"Suddenly, it began to rain."
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
"Jump across the ditch. ""I will if you will."""
I'm not what I used to be.
I just had to ask Tom that question.
Someone is hiding in the corner.
Are you the one who wrote this?
What changed their minds?
She is not as old as my sister is.
Tom isn't married.
Did you know Tom used to be a French teacher?
Tom said Mary is very happy.
I'll shoot you.
Tom will come with me.
Tom told me someone was trying to kill him.
Your driver's license has expired.
Tom got nothing.
This is the part I hate the most.
Tom fell from the top bunk.
Why don't we ask Tom to help?
Tom shared his umbrella with Mary.
We need a place to stay for the night.
I have been to Kyoto one time.
Please wait here for a while.
The bird spread its wings.
I can't see what you mean.
Would you like some more cookies?
I need to protect myself.
You might want to save some cake for Tom.
"I would like to learn to play the piano, guitar or flute."
We came to play.
I've got a surprise for you.
Are you 18?
Some fish are able to change their gender.
Is there something in particular that you want to hear?
I have to find it.
Tom wanted to help Mary pick up chestnuts.
The boy grew up to be a great statesman.
This novel was written by an American writer.
See below.
How many people do you know that don't have health insurance?
Tom is arguing with Mary.
Do you drink coffee every day?
Who's that girl?
There is some truth in that.
Would you like to come to my party?
I feel well today.
I know an English teacher who comes from Canada.
Come off it!
That's just not enough.
I think you're interesting.
Lead is easily bent.
Let them know we're busy.
The rabbit jumped over the dog.
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
Tom is hiding a terrible secret.
How far are you prepared to go?
Tom burned all the pictures he had of his ex-girlfriend.
Put on your shoes.
Singing comes as naturally to her as flying does to birds.
Tom says Mary should resign.
It never pays to lose your temper.
Have you called the boss already?
Tom must be at least thirty years old.
Do you live in the city?
I don't like talking about myself.
You're really a nice person.
We have detected an abnormality on your x-ray.
I have almost no money with me.
The two dogs sniffed each other.
They can't push us around.
How come you never told me you were from Boston?
He could not swim.
Don't burst my bubble.
What are you going to do here?
I'm beginning to understand why.
I don't want to be involved in this affair.
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle.
Tom and Mary started throwing snowballs at each other.
He hit his head on the shelf.
I've heard it said that you should never marry your first love.
My wife's constant nagging really gets on my nerves.
We stayed at a hotel by the lake.
I don't want to be alone all my life.
"Here are some flowers for you. ""Thanks. They're gorgeous."""
Many kinds of birds live in Japan.
Keep searching.
There are always a lot of vehicles on this road.
You can only use it once.
I don't like to laugh.
Maybe that's the reason.
I couldn't fall asleep because of the noise.
He sang some old songs.
Tom is the only person I know who doesn't like watching football.
Tom gave some candy to his grandchildren.
Tom was admiring my new car at the time the truck crashed into it.
Tom complained to the teacher.
I promise I'll do that before the end of the month.
"I don't have money, but I have dreams."
He aspires to become a teacher.
Tom was humiliated.
I think I'd like to be your friend.
My mother would freak out if she knew about it.
I'm at the police station.
Do you understand what the problem is?
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
Don't pressure Tom.
I'm coming in.
I bet Tom doesn't sleep a wink tonight.
Tom is working with us.
A swarm of hornets attacked the children.
Tom can fix anything.
Approximately seven billion people inhabit our planet.
I know a good lawyer who can help you.
Tom was victorious.
"Can you excuse me, please?"
This book is very popular among women.
"I appreciate what you're doing, but I don't think it'll help."
Tom was just trying to be funny.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the pay he was getting.
His pace quickened.
"Thank you for coming, Tom."
The police are after me.
Be careful up there.
This room is large enough.
Tom wondered where Mary had spent the weekend.
You don't get to choose.
Tom likes to watch TV while he eats.
Who cheated?
"My father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather all had the same name as I have."
"Tom, are you okay?"
Tom died trying to save Mary.
When will you leave?
Don't make me ask you again.
"Who is younger, him or me?"
I don't really like him.
No passengers were injured.
"This book is written in simple English, so it should be easy for you to read."
"Tom asked the same question over and over, but never got an answer."
I think you should give Tom a chance.
It's a situation I would love to change.
Sign your name there.
Don't make a decision right now.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
There is somebody in the meeting room.
It's comfortable.
Tom picked up that habit from his father.
She was born lucky.
This book is about stars.
I'd rather not go there alone.
Today is a hot day.
It's their job.
Tom is able to play the flute.
I can teach English.
Is this your dog?
Everyone should exercise their right to vote.
That is mine. I don't know where hers is.
You taught us that.
I'm not very good at it.
Do you have to make a speech?
This is considered to be a matter of great importance.
That's Saturn.
The tip of the knife is sharp.
I'll try to keep up with Tom.
The children threw snowballs at each other.
Tom turned the faucet on.
I've made up my mind to study harder from now on.
We played and laughed.
Tom keeps a diary.
Tom climbed down.
My father used to eat at this restaurant.
She is always neatly dressed.
"Your name wouldn't be Tom, by any chance, would it?"
He took his book.
I can't feel my toes.
How is your wife doing?
You're better at this than I am.
I bought her a clock.
"You were in the second year of middle school last year, right?"
You're not answering the question.
Tom heard the sound of breaking glass.
My uncle bought me this book.
Just a second. Let me finish.
I'll let you know in a day or so.
Did you enjoy your winter holidays?
The little girl hugged her teddy bear.
Tom leaned down.
I'll get the money from Tom one way or another.
Look what you've done.
We have to make sure we get this done by 2:30.
I'm going to bed. Good night.
Alcoholism is incurable.
I want Tom's money.
Play another song for us.
Did Tom ever ask you to stop doing that?
Your bicycle is much newer than mine.
Tom and I had a stupid fight.
It's good to be here.
Tom hopes one day to compete in the Olympics.
Are you saying you don't want to go?
Shouldn't you overlook his indiscretions and forgive him?
Send it by airmail.
We saw nothing strange.
I'm going to the bank.
I don't think it would take more than 15 minutes to clean your room.
We do what we have to.
Sit down anywhere you want.
Feel the rhythm and follow the beat.
Where are the other girls?
Where is the most beautiful place in the world?
Is tomorrow Saturday?
"I've got good news for you, Tom."
He came here to help me.
Don't mess with Tom.
That was all Greek to me.
I like garlic.
I want to eat pizza.
I want to go there again.
Who should I be afraid of?
Philosophers tend to have little contact with the outside world.
I'm secretly in love with someone else's wife.
We have to find Tom.
"I couldn't recognize him, not having met him before."
I only know that Tom isn't happy.
Are you a dog person or a cat person?
Tom says he's not happy.
Tom's hand was bitten by a moray eel.
They were better than I expected.
Do you have any idea why Tom gave it to you?
I was about to go out when he came to see me.
I'd like to pay with my credit card instead.
The rules aren't important.
How long have you been smoking?
The cat crept toward the bird.
She was alone in the house.
Tom hates everybody.
I couldn't keep up with Tom.
"I don't know if you've noticed or not, but Tom hasn't been getting to work on time recently."
I can't look at this anymore.
"I'd like to stay and chat, but I've got a meeting to go to."
Tom didn't want to tell anyone what his last name was.
She laid the magazine on the table.
"You said Tom was upset, but he didn't seem that way to me."
I don't have to be here.
He put his hands in his pockets.
That team has nothing but strong players.
He earns three times as much as me.
Please get out of my office immediately.
Isn't this great?
I saw her home.
Tom told me you were upset.
Tom followed my advice.
The jet plane had 500 passengers on board.
I don't want to ruin your day.
I don't have anything to give to you.
I know what you are thinking.
They're waiting for us.
We missed our train.
Tom won't approve.
I'd like to work for you as long as possible.
It's not too late to tell Tom that you love him.
I'm still hungry.
We had better not remain here.
Tom found it.
These clothes are too small for him.
It's a welcome change.
There's no sugar.
It's still too cold to wear shorts.
The new law was a major reform.
It's quite simple.
We can't predict what'll happen.
I like pop music.
I wonder where he is hiding.
It happens every night.
You can have my sandwich.
I've decided not to swim this afternoon.
Tom wasn't like that at first.
My desktop has gotten cluttered.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary did.
I am interested in getting a hat like this.
Tom will be here for three more weeks.
The rumor proved to be an absolute lie.
Great progress has been made.
He came in spite of the heavy snow.
He was unaware of the situation.
How do we stop Tom?
Not everybody is the same.
He is an intelligent boy.
I want to be as rich as Tom.
Tom walked off the dance floor.
Is this your bicycle?
You'll find this map very useful.
Is there anything special you want to do this weekend?
Who ran?
Tom was lucky to grow up in a multilingual environment.
I've been to the bank.
Tom said he had room in his garage for me to keep some of my things.
Tom was released from the hospital last month.
I nearly died.
"It was very cold, so we stayed at home."
You can't say a word about this to anyone.
I'm in a hurry.
Promise me you'll do that.
I bought flowers because my grandmother is coming today for a visit.
Tom is defensive.
Kids don't read books anymore.
I took an arrow in the knee.
"Hey, what's this?"
"You're the expert, Tom."
I told him to come.
She likes to dress in an old-fashioned way.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
It smells delicious.
I have seen Mt. Fuji.
My wish is to go to Switzerland.
I'll make you a drink.
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to kick you.
I've studied French for three years.
Tom didn't intend to let Mary kiss him.
I'm visiting my grandmother in the hospital.
I'm allergic to fish.
"I can speak Chinese, but I can't write it."
We weren't doing anything wrong.
I hope to see you again.
"If you don't want to do this, you don't have to."
Boil the soup down until it becomes thick.
He concealed the book under his coat.
"Some fish live in rivers, others in the sea."
Did you mean this?
Tom smoked.
Don't look at me like that.
You'll learn a lot here.
Tom lost.
I have lost my camera.
Do you know Tom personally?
Where do you buy your clothes?
I'll make something up.
He lives a long way away.
We were all asleep.
Why don't you come and see me sometime?
Do I really need to tell you again?
You shouldn't let the children watch so much television.
"By the time our long conversation was over, Mother was tired of standing."
Tom and Mary ran into the water.
There is a little money in the bag.
Why don't you hang around a while after everyone else leaves so we can talk?
Tom freed the bird.
I can't tell you what to do.
We're not friends anymore.
I want to help you.
She reminds me of someone.
Mary put a note in Tom's lunchbox to tell him how much she loves him.
Tom didn't see you.
How long did it take you to record this album?
Tom had no money with him at that time.
He must be stopped at all costs.
I was in trouble with the police last night.
We didn't do anything.
It can be repaired.
I'll show you.
The old man lives alone.
I like to swim in salt water.
You don't need to do it right away.
I can wait.
They were out of breath after swimming across the river.
Tom took up hang gliding.
Is it safe to swim in this river?
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
What do we have here?
This book will give you a clear idea of the American way of life.
I've got a brand new bike.
I'll never do that again.
Today I love the entire world.
Don't fool yourself. He doesn't love you.
"The little girl, deeply moved by the old man's pitiful story, burst into tears."
You should think about your future.
I won't do anything dumb.
What is the subject of your lecture?
Just check it.
I think I'll take this tie.
I'm very lonely.
I thought you'd like Tom.
I bumped into him at the station.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
"When Tom told Mary to feel right at home, he was secretly hoping that she'd go and wash up the dishes in the kitchen."
We are grateful to you for your help.
Tom bent down to look under the table.
Put on your hat.
You lied to my face.
The men's room is on the second floor.
I just ignore Tom.
We don't want the bus to leave without us.
I like mahjong.
Everybody likes Tom.
It is not easy to learn a foreign language.
This would be a lot easier if you would help.
I know you're not planning on staying here for a long time.
We have had a lot of rain this summer.
Tom is seldom late for school.
I only ate one piece of cake.
I have to hide this bag.
Time passes quickly.
Some of us have to work this weekend.
This is very kind of you.
You seem to be in all these pictures.
Tom said you'd know.
She'll love her husband forever.
Tom took a big swig from the bottle.
I spread the big map on the table.
May I pay by check?
Tom wishes he didn't have to help with the housework.
Take mine.
Do you want to eat anything?
I wanted to introduce myself.
I will come earlier next time.
We did everything for the welfare of our children.
You must take care of the dog.
His word is law.
I'm a Japanese student.
Tom usually keeps his phone in manner mode.
"I knocked on the door, but nobody answered."
Stay with us for a few days.
I am eating an apple.
Tom asked Mary to help him with his science project.
He examined the spare parts one after another.
Those countries used to belong to France.
We can begin.
I was looking forward to it.
The speaker requested that the audience remain silent.
Taxes are too high.
He is stronger than ever.
Perhaps you're right.
Tom was reading a letter written in French.
This glass contains water.
Why doesn't he tell the truth?
I've climbed Mt. Fuji.
He was unable to completely give up on his hopes of marrying her.
Tom has been absent from school for three days.
Tom was in a hurry this morning.
It's time to take the pie out of the oven.
I changed clothes.
How do you like your new school?
They were too tired to climb a mountain.
Eventually the salesman persuaded me to buy the expensive machine.
It seems to be serious.
This book should help you a lot.
I teach Spanish.
Do you have any idea why Tom isn't here?
How do you do this?
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
I've lost it.
He's right behind me.
Are you going to take part in the contest?
What is it you're looking for?
Let's get together in my office.
You can't hide from me.
The children are making a lot of noise.
The rumor quickly spread.
I thanked Tom for the present.
I'm the one who should apologize.
Tom is waiting for Mary to arrive.
Don't leave here until you have done it.
Everything changes.
"Fill it up, please."
The month after next is December.
I will make up for the lost time by working as hard as I can.
What do you want to do after you graduate?
Why not just call the police?
Tom advised Mary to go to see a doctor.
Tom was paralyzed by a stroke.
Do you want that?
You need to stop smoking.
"By seven o'clock in the evening, the streets are deserted in this town."
I would like to have another cup of coffee.
You have to stop it.
Take this knife and cut the top off.
Tom likes wine.
What's this room?
Do you want to know who I am?
He argued that the new policy was bound to drive the economy into recession.
I have hay fever.
Why is it that you're always late?
Keep to the right.
I like both dogs and cats.
Let Tom buy a new computer if he wants to.
Do you know how to whistle?
I did my homework yesterday.
We did not expect many to attend.
You know I can't wait any longer.
I know my rights.
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.
Tom was interviewed on TV last night.
Tom is going to be thirty next year.
Tom thought Mary was in the room.
"Nobody has asked you to agree, but can't you at least accept that there are people who hold different views from you?"
"Two glasses of orange juice, please."
Tom has been flirting with Mary all night.
Tom waited for Mary to call.
The value of a good education cannot be measured in terms of money.
My mother could speak five languages.
Do you want me to make coffee?
No other dog is bigger than this.
I don't understand French at all.
Tom was unable to walk.
Where did you buy your schoolbag?
Black coats are in fashion this winter.
I usually go to the barber once a month.
He crawled out of bed.
Mail service in that country is not quick.
Which one do you think Tom is going to buy?
New factories and industrial centers were built.
I should just go home.
Real men drink tea.
That is the exactly the same idea as I have.
Is this Latin?
"Strictly speaking, that's true."
He was born in Nagasaki.
He arrived in time.
It's a beautiful day.
It's not very durable.
A lot of sugar cane is grown in Cuba.
The addict died from a drug overdose.
I bought a hybrid.
I drink my coffee black.
What is in the desk?
He died fighting in the Vietnam War.
"It's my mistake, not yours."
I'll wait until four o'clock.
He did it for the money.
Have you got something to crack these nuts?
She's a smart and independent girl.
That one's OK.
Tom remembers telling Mary the story about how he had escaped from being eaten by cannibals.
The gun is jammed.
You owe Tom an apology.
Many teachers have a problem with Tom.
"Excuse me, but you're mistaken."
It is time you had a haircut!
You two seem to hate each other.
Try to stay calm.
Let's get drunk.
The cause of the fire was his cigarette butt.
Tom handed Mary a book.
My neighbor's dog is dead.
Tom has nothing to complain about.
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
Do you like chocolate milk?
Should I try to talk to Tom?
Do you live alone?
I wish I had a car.
He wrote this book at the age of twenty.
Tom discovered that he had run out of money.
He fell asleep right away.
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.
"I looked in my closet for something to wear, but couldn't find anything appropriate for the occasion."
You're unfair.
She wanted him to help her father.
There was no one left but me.
Tom walked over to the woman with a drink in her hand and asked her what her name was.
You must help us.
We'll all miss you.
That'll have to do.
We saw the military attaché of the American Embassy.
I go to bed at ten almost every day.
Do you know who wrote this book?
What did you do today?
The gorgeous cake made my mouth water.
They went to the movies last night.
I think Tom should do that.
Aren't you allowed to do that?
He knows how to teach languages.
They blamed the driver for the accident.
Here's your lunch.
That's why I told you not to go by yourself.
Why are people scared of you?
Her husband also wanted custody of the children.
Where is the nearest telephone box?
Tom is a good boy.
Tom knows us well.
What you are saying does not make sense.
She came with good news.
They're coming again.
Can I take your word for it?
You'd better tell Tom you're sorry.
It was hot last night.
Tom doesn't want to study French.
It isn't safe to walk alone at night.
You look just like your older brother.
I can't take that risk.
The man sitting on that bench is Tom.
Can you tell me where Tom lives?
Tom wished he were able to visit Boston more often.
Tom is my ex.
Come and see what Tom is doing.
Do you have a lighter?
Tom had never been so busy before.
Tom has piles of money.
"Open your eyes, Tom."
He hit me on the head.
He had fun with her.
I put the money into the safe.
He did not have much time to work on his speech.
Tom put the book back on the shelf.
Can I give you a piece of advice?
Now don't pout.
Tom got up at six almost every day.
Anybody can do that.
Bring the frozen fish here.
Tom says that he can drink a whole bottle of whiskey without getting drunk.
Tom doesn't remember exactly what happened.
Freeze!
I got out of jail yesterday.
It's morning.
The security guards wrestled Tom to the ground.
She plans to marry a rich man.
There's something else I want to discuss with you.
I think that'll happen someday.
I live in Turkey.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
I disagree with you on the matter.
No one knows what has happened to him.
Her husband's success hasn't affected her attitude toward old friends.
Everybody seems to like it.
They aren't happy.
You are too young to travel alone.
Tom does like you.
Tom offered to drive Mary home.
Duty calls.
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
When was the last time Tom took Mary out to dinner?
I offered Tom a fair deal.
The barber has cut your hair very short.
Tom has left the building.
My house is big.
We took him to the hospital right away.
Tom was standing in front of Mary's house.
It's really windy today.
Mary isn't Tom's wife.
I'm completely naked.
More tractors meant fewer horses and mules.
"Since he doesn't feel well today, he can't come to the office."
Their parents are older than ours.
Tom got into his car and quickly drove off.
We know what we're doing.
Shall I get you a chair?
Please come into my room to help me.
We are basketball players.
There are no clean plates.
Tom is contented.
Tom thinks he has the flu.
Tom was making a lot of noise.
Have you watched it?
It is a small dog.
Tom left the office at 2:30.
Tom was bitten by a wild animal.
I'm very pleased to have met you.
Tom got burned.
She went to the museum by cab.
Let us know by next Monday.
I have returned.
What do you suggest that we do now?
Are they arriving at ten o'clock in the morning or at night?
Tell me a joke.
People living in this area are dying because of the lack of water.
He acknowledged me by lifting his hat.
Please pass me the jam.
"You can go or stay, as you wish."
Where's Tom working now?
Tom just called.
This problem is both yours and ours.
What if the good guys were really the bad guys?
Tom looked hungry.
He has a lot of confidence.
My cat is hungry.
I think the future looks good.
I guess I'm a little antsy.
I think you understand me.
You'll have to come here.
Old people have difficulty understanding modern technology.
I put some cream in my coffee.
What do you think of these people?
Your earrings are gorgeous.
I got up at seven.
Sometimes you don't need to speak the same language in order to understand each other.
Everybody in the picture is smiling happily.
Tom had to read the sign on the door three times before he understood it.
Tom felt guilty.
Please let me know when I should get off.
We are all anxious about your health.
There are a lot of stars which are larger than our sun.
He often shuts himself up in the study and writes things like this.
I don't want to study German.
"Put your hand over your mouth when you cough, sneeze or yawn."
How do you know my name?
"You can't imagine doing that, can you?"
Don't be late for school again.
Tom isn't as innocent as he seems.
Just call me Tom.
Please send my mail to me in care of my father's office in Tokyo.
That was your third drink.
"Hurry up, or you will miss the train."
"If it gets dangerous, give me a call."
The house burned to the ground.
Did you recognize your old classmate?
We'll follow Tom.
Lightning struck Tom's house.
I have Monday off.
Tom goes to a private school.
How can I get to the train station?
Can you believe that?
My train left at six and arrived at ten.
The children called Tom a mama's boy.
I'm glad I'm not like that.
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I like Tom. He's a nice guy.
This will happen.
Why exactly would you want to do that?
Tom said that there was a monster under his bed.
My neighborhood has a parade on the 4th of July.
I want to know what you know.
I visited him in the hospital.
Choose whichever you like.
"Don't just stand around, lend a hand."
We ran out of food.
We have tried everything.
Tom convinced me.
She's donating money for cancer research.
It's not clean.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
I'm very impressed.
Tom gave me advice.
More is needed.
He regretted having quit his job.
I advise you not to do that.
Was Tom the one who did this?
I didn't know you were so good at French.
I didn't catch your last name.
I need you to help me with this.
Do you want the rest of my sandwich?
That's his house.
Stay in the car.
Tom didn't like living in Boston.
Are you hungry?
The boy has a newspaper.
We associate Einstein with the theory of relativity.
I'm afraid you're wrong.
Please wake me up at 6 tomorrow morning.
Tom hasn't lost any weight even though he says he's been dieting.
What do they look like?
There are some things you can't learn from books.
I decided to become a doctor.
She wants to keep him at a distance.
I don't want to hurt your feelings.
Tom is very unlucky.
"As long as we live, we have to work."
Tom is three thousand dollars in debt.
What did you say his name was?
Someone put something in my drink.
Father told us a very interesting story.
Beginners should learn spoken English first.
I thought Tom died last year in Boston.
He drank three bottles of beer.
She is familiar with Japanese history.
She locked the door.
I think I won't go to work today.
Tom ate the whole cake by himself.
"It really has been a while, hasn't it?"
I've completely recovered.
I have to go back.
Tom is illiterate.
A billion adults are illiterate.
Are you afraid of getting hurt?
They don't pay Tom much to do that.
Why are they crying?
Tom said he was going to help Mary.
It's healthy and normal.
He will come.
Tom suggested to Mary that she apologize and make amends.
Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
I need a pencil. Can I use one of yours?
I drank some wine.
Tom looked hurt.
"You're really handy, aren't you? Don't you think you'd make a good house-husband?"
Tom wants to know why Mary didn't go to school today.
Banks open at nine o'clock.
How are things?
Finishing the report by tomorrow is next to impossible.
I'd like to go to the movies.
The doctor gave me a shot.
Your bath is ready.
You ought to have known that he was sick in bed.
Tom and Mary both like old movies.
"I have a lot of vices, but smoking isn't one of them."
Call your brother.
Tom closed the door and locked it.
Does Tom know how to drive?
We could hear the bells ringing from a nearby church.
We're willing to learn.
This is by far the tallest building in this city.
Tom's mother was a wise woman.
Do you want to know his name?
He drank beer.
I still think it's unlikely that we'll find any evidence to prove Tom's guilt.
What teams were playing?
This is the strangest thing I've ever done.
We have lots of other things to drink.
Tom knew it.
Many of my friends don't have children.
Tom went back to Boston yesterday.
It snowed.
Tom was almost as surprised as Mary.
A hexagon has six sides.
Tom said he thought Mary needed at least $300 to buy what she needed.
I didn't call an ambulance.
We're finished here.
Have you already signed the contract?
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
Tom has proved that it works.
"As far as I know, he is one of the best doctors in town."
Tom failed to keep his promise.
My grandfather is very fond of reading.
I love driving.
Who's your favorite celebrity?
Tom got a tattoo.
She cleaned the house all by herself.
That's what I like to see.
Terrorists blew up a bus.
Which is your guitar?
We had lunch in the meeting room.
I have to write an essay.
Tom is three years younger than Mary.
"When we arrived at the stadium, the game had already started."
"You agree with Tom, right?"
Tom doesn't know when Mary will come back.
"Now that he is old, it is your duty to look after him."
Never go anywhere alone.
She goes to school on foot.
Tom doesn't like studying.
I'd like to talk to the head of security.
Can't you just ask Tom to help us?
Where did they learn this?
I like school.
She won the contest.
There's no place to hide.
Tom can't remember where he buried the treasure.
Mary dyed her hair blue.
You'd better tell me what happened.
She dumped him for a younger man.
I spent the whole day in the park.
We need some collapsible chairs.
Football is an old game.
How long have you been watching me?
It really was a miracle.
We have a good life together.
What time does it start?
Can you guess the worth of the diamond?
Will you give me a ride to my hotel?
Tom didn't get very far.
He asked me who painted the picture.
I swim once a week.
It is not good for your health to shut yourself in all day.
I take back everything I've said.
Was that you in the car?
Would you like some more bread?
Don't ask me such a hard question.
Don't leave your work half finished.
Tom told me he hasn't done that yet.
I did not notice how she was dressed.
"If I had known your telephone number, I would've called you."
Don't touch me!
"You gave Tom the money he asked for, didn't you?"
I am too tired to climb.
Have another.
Tom was lonely and wished he had someone to talk to.
She clearly does not mean it.
I wonder whether or not Tom likes Chinese food.
Does she speak English?
Why are you sitting here in the dark?
Why are you scared of Tom?
He was perfect.
I had a bladder infection last month.
Tom looked tired.
This book belongs to me.
The police officer shone his flashlight in Tom's face.
He was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
Don't smoke in here.
This rule is often ignored.
He was just thirty-six years old.
He deemed it wise to accept the offer.
You're always so worried about what other people think.
You can stay here till the snow stops.
"In America, you are a minor if you are under 18 years old."
Tom has some very important things that he has to do.
That dress fit her perfectly.
I saw you looking at Tom.
I thought you knew that.
Tom opened his eyes and saw Mary.
Don't spoil your child.
"When we made fun of her, she blushed."
I was mildly disappointed.
What is your address?
You don't want to seem desperate.
My dream is to become a firefighter.
"Owing to the bad weather, the game was put off."
Tom put his ear to the door and listened.
We have to undo what was done.
She lowered her standards.
Let's get down to business.
My mother's going to kill me.
The suspect was last seen wearing blue jeans and an orange sweatshirt.
Nobody knows where Tom went.
This book is about China.
Tom called Mary to the telephone.
Tom is probably in the building.
I wonder why he is late.
I felt much more relaxed.
Tom writes better than I do.
What a cute little girl!
That isn't my fault.
She sat next to me.
What do you have to say with regard to this problem?
I need this back by tomorrow.
That's what Tom did last year.
Tom would accept.
Tom continued to study French for another three years.
Daddy loves to say funny things.
Tom came just before dinner.
Tom lost his house keys.
"Well, stranger things have happened."
It looks easy when you do it.
She felt that her place was with her husband.
Tom has always wanted to do that.
I'm glad I was there.
My father played golf on the Sunday morning.
He'll understand.
Are you sure you can do this?
It is foggy.
I'll take that one.
It's as cold as ice.
It isn't easy to write a love letter in English.
Our plan will call for a lot of money.
You must repay your debts.
Don't be sorry.
Tom said he didn't know French.
I think it'll rain today.
I'm going to get some air.
She was deceived by a friend.
Stop telling me what to do. You're not my mom.
Please let me know if you find any typos or missing words.
"Even though it's small, it's still a great car."
"I'm looking for a warm, woolen skirt."
Tom would lend you money if he had any.
Industry as we know it today didn't exist in those days.
Do you really need that?
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me.
We considered the problem from all angles.
He dressed up as a woman.
"The higher we climb, the colder it becomes."
I'll get in.
It is said that she is a good cook.
I heard the phone ring.
Nobody volunteers.
I'd like to study in China to improve the level of my Chinese.
That is my dog.
We assemble water heaters.
The young girl gave the guest a little flower.
Tom explained in detail how to do it.
He's on his last legs.
Tom loves sports.
Give me the green book.
I couldn't sleep well last night.
Tom wore a dark blue suit.
We have to get a new one.
The answer misses the point.
"If I have time, I'll do it."
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
I'm going bald.
No one came with me.
That's what we think.
I made a fist.
I wish to climb Mt. Fuji again.
Is it too big?
She filled her bag with apples.
A book came for you in the mail today.
I've just finished writing a letter.
The boy came running.
"You're not going to do that, are you?"
Last night I wrote a letter.
Let me hear your frank opinion.
I see no reason to continue this discussion.
Clean that up.
That's huge.
Tom isn't an easy person to get along with.
He broke the window intentionally.
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom sounds desperate.
I know you have to go back to Boston.
There's no hot water.
We're supposed to be protecting Tom.
I asked Tom to turn around.
Tom needs to call a doctor.
We're going to have a test today.
"If Tom's not careful, he's going to get injured."
You will know the truth some day.
We were at a loss what to do.
I just want to talk with you a little while.
What was it you asked Tom to do?
I got a D on my science test.
Tom has an insatiable appetite.
My uncle is a veteran of the Vietnam War.
What's wrong with you?
Did you write this book?
I think Tom is sleeping.
Are you busy on Sunday afternoon?
My wife is always complaining about something.
I have a friend who feeds his dog strawberries.
Tom's mother is single.
"Tom, are you downstairs?"
What have you eaten?
We both can sleep in the same tent.
America is not the most democratic nation.
I want to be a nature photographer.
He loves her.
Nothing can be produced out of nothing.
You're double-parked.
It is just your imagination.
I just can't memorize students' names.
Tom is waking up.
Are you gonna help me or what?
He made up his mind quickly.
"Do you think she'll come? ""I hope not."""
This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
There is no clock in my room.
Tom tried in vain to convince Mary to go to art school.
I advise you to stop smoking.
I know something about it.
That does it.
We had bacon and eggs.
The damage amounted to five million yen.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
The doctor told Tom to lower the amount of red meat that he ate.
Tom is very sure that Mary did that.
It's so impersonal.
Something tells me I should've said no.
I spent the entire day on the beach.
You can't help me.
He proved to be an ideal husband.
She is never on time.
Tom could come with me if he wants to.
Did they fire you?
Tom almost smiled.
He found the door closed.
I know precisely what you are feeling.
What do you know about climate change?
Tom will never tell you what really happened.
She looks like her mother.
What is popular now?
Which of them is your brother?
That hadn't occurred to me.
"She has her faults, but I like her."
Nobody takes me anywhere.
Please ask someone else.
Do you want to eat?
Everybody knows who you are.
"Hold still for a moment, please."
I knew you were hiding in the car.
He learned that poem by heart when he was five years old.
You can't fire me.
I know you want to keep it a secret.
My parents love me.
I had not waited long before the bus came.
Tom told Mary that he had feelings for her.
Tom hasn't even held Mary's hand yet.
Tom should've arrived in Boston by now.
He can be relied on.
I have a lot of problems at the moment.
Tom isn't tough.
Would you like to go for a walk with me?
I am poor at swimming.
I'm using this.
"He said, ""It's nine o'clock."""
It looked like Tom was searching for something.
Cesar Chavez asked that strikers remain non-violent even though farm owners and their supporters sometimes used violence.
Tom kept the fact that he was already married a secret from Mary.
We have more in common than I thought.
It is very cold here all the year round.
He speaks as if he had read the book before.
Tom didn't quite know what Mary meant.
What was discussed?
Tom sat alone at the kitchen table.
Don't buy that.
I don't think he is truthful.
Come back here.
What's wrong with wearing pink?
Tom loves it.
Where did you go?
The students chose her chairman.
No one loves you.
Call me again in two days.
These days I'm very busy.
Tom will have breakfast early tomorrow.
Tom died before his son was born.
I can barely pay my rent.
Do you think it'll fit?
What an interesting choice of words.
Do what he tells you.
She came in with tears in her eyes.
Is this your book?
Do you want to resign?
I'm going to park the car.
Tom isn't good at playing charades.
Tom peeked out the window to see if it was safe to leave.
Would you like to drink anything?
Tom was not much older than Mary.
Do you know where Tom was hiding?
He speaks French fluently.
It's unlikely that our team will win.

Tom was bullied.
"You didn't actually lie to Tom, did you?"
"Tom ate part of the ham, and then put the rest into the refrigerator."
"The subway in London is known as ""the Tube."""
I am hanging up my shirts.
Trust Tom.
Why are you whispering?
He acts quickly.
You're great at this.
All you had to do was talk to Tom.
We walked slowly along the road.
Why don't we share a room?
Do you agree with this?
We drank some wine.
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
She can't ski.
I'm not trying to impress anyone.
You could get arrested for that.
What color was Tom wearing?
"You don't smoke, do you?"
The whole thing turned out to be a Ponzi scheme.
I leave it to your imagination.
I hate people like you.
He keeps two cats.
Tom asked Mary when she was planning to leave.
My father fixed a broken chair.
I don't want to go to Italy.
I think I'm losing my mind.
These pills come in a blister pack.
I opened the box and looked inside.
You cannot lose.
I don't know whether Tom is busy or not.
Tom is in no hurry to retire.
Jeans are now in fashion among girls.
I'd buy it if I weren't broke.
Would it be OK if I asked you a personal question?
I saw the girl swimming in the river.
Tom visited us this past weekend.
"You aren't rich, are you?"
I don't have your number.
Something's wrong with my e-mail.
That might be true.
Her book is red.
Tom tried to start the car.
There's still a fair bit of work to be done.
My computer crashed and I lost everything.
I asked Tom to drop me off at the train station.
They're my cousins.
What doesn't kill you will make you stronger.
You must not take advantage of her innocence.
Is that a wig?
The workers went on strike.
"You've already made your decision, haven't you?"
Let's wait here.
I had to keep moving.
They have nothing to eat.

I wanted to talk to you about your grades.
Tom fell off the diving board.
What she said is wrong.
The conference drew 150 diplomats.
This bus is going to Boston.
Let's get down to business.
The turkey was tender and juicy.
Tom remembers.
I don't want to be in your way.
I can barely stand up.
Tom could do with some help.
"He was ill, so he couldn't come."
You may go anywhere you like.
Tom usually only reads the headlines.
I'm glad you're back.
Which road goes to city hall?
Birds learn to fly by instinct.
I know that Tom is happy.
Can you tell me where Tom lives?
Please do not kill me.
I don't believe one word of it.
Tom has a big mouth.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
He applied for the job and got it.
I did it the way he told me to.
You can always rely on me.
That's enough for today. I'm tired.
We are changing our clothes.
Down with the king!
Tom was lenient.
You can't tell Tom what happened.
The road is under repair.
Tom looked sad.
Has Tom really come back?
You'd better hurry up.
All of us were surprised at the news.
I could use some help here.
Be quiet while I am speaking.
It's impossible to fix.
She knows. She always knows.
Let's put the past behind us.
I wanted to talk about it.
I'm just trying to survive.
Tom came into the room.
My parents caught me smoking.
Tom and Mary went for a walk even though it was raining.
I'm happy for all of you.
Your cat is overweight.
A violinist I know says that he owns a Stradivarius.
Do you fish?
You'd better be very sure before you accuse Tom of anything.
I don't remember anything.
Would you like me to do that work?
Don't take that too literally.
I've asked you repeatedly to do that.
Take this medicine when you have a cold.
I look forward to meeting you again soon.
Tom got in his car and went home.
Am I confusing you?
Tom is very inflexible.
Some people have even visited the moon.
I have a toothache.
Tom agreed.
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary.
I was deeply impressed with his courage.
Turkey is a beautiful country.
Is Tom any better?
Don't stop him.
Both Tom and Mary were surprised.

Help me to understand.
Tom knows he's right.

I've heard that in Germany beer is cheaper than water. Is that true?
Tom has no intention of staying in Boston for the rest of his life.

How much cash do you have?

I want to drink tea.
You can't ride a horse.
He is a waiter in a seaside restaurant.
Have you ever tried Turkish food?

I wasn't looking at you.
His mother is constantly complaining about it.
"My name's Tom, too."
Does he know how you feel?
That's true as well.
Tom asked Mary to look after the children.
These two brothers resemble each other.
Tom cheated on the history exam.
Tom's mother died in 2013.
It's very satisfying.
I'm in my apartment.
No one believes that anymore.
They won't believe me even if I swear it is true.
I doubt that Tom will ever come back home.
Tom can't ride a bicycle yet.
Tom waited nearby.
Tom was only thirteen years old at that time.
Stop right here.
Leave this to me.
I'm not good at singing.
Everybody hates me.
I am going in the same direction. Come with me. I will take you there.
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I am an English teacher.
The hard disk was completely destroyed.
I can't give Tom these.
It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Mary is spinning wool.
My niece is a serious girl.
I have something important to discuss with Tom.
When does the next train leave?
It's mine.
We carried out that plan.
You lied to me again.
The park is filled with children.
"Give me your opinion, please."
"Rain, rain, go away. Come again another day."
Tom had to make a difficult decision.
I can't stand it anymore.

When do you need it by?

"You knew about this already, didn't you?"
You can tell the truth.
He kept it secret that he had bought a bicycle for his son.
It's just amazing.
What caused the accident?
The whole family was sitting around the campfire.
They escaped.
Mary is one of the most beautiful girls I know.
Would you like to hear my opinion?
"Could someone make an example sentence in German using the word ""Beispiel?"""

Do you really want to talk about that now?
The supermarket hired many part-timers.

Thank you in advance.
Here is your dog. Where is mine?
I can't sleep on this lumpy mattress.
"Finally, the bell rang."
I've studied French for years.
Tom is an experienced salesman.
I wish you were here with me.
He is wealthy in appearance but not in reality.
That's the one we want.
Give me a copy of this book.
It was child's play.

The candle went out by itself.
Tom needs to make an urgent telephone call.

They are at lunch.
The game was very exciting.
You must make the decision on your own.
You can't see Tom today.

Why are you avoiding me?
Tom speaks French much better than English.
There are scarcely any flowers in our garden.

What makes you think I'm not happy?
Tom and Mary played table tennis together.

He does not get up early.
Some songs come from Scotland.
Tom used his secluded cabin in the woods as a getaway from his hectic life as a company director.
Your question is hard to answer.
I don't like your boss.
"I like to watch sports on TV, especially baseball."
Tom is using you.
"Between you and me, I think our boss is stupid."
You're probably right.
Is that black bag yours?
I do not want to cause you any trouble.
Can someone help me?

We know that everything we need to do is on the list.
I admire you for your courage.
He hadn't eaten anything the whole day and was hungry.
Why can't you come?

I'd do the same for you.
"Tom dreamed that he had won the contest, but that his prize had been stolen."
Tom is my boy.
Tom's brain was deprived of oxygen for too long.
I will do anything for you.
He left for England at the beginning of August.
This is the plate that Tom ate off of.
Don't even think of asking me to lend you some money.
I have to get that.
I suppose you're hungry.
Let me have a word with Tom.
I believe that's correct.
I am very hungry.
Think about what I said.
I was in the middle of my dinner when the phone rang.
Is there a barber shop in the hotel?
I don't like this jacket.
Did we have any English homework due tomorrow?
We should not impose our opinions on other people.
"Let's play tennis. ""Yes let's."""
Of course I believe you.
Has something else happened?

Are we in danger?
I owe you ten dollars.
Could you show me the way to the station?
I was surprised at his strong resemblance to his father.
"If I'd had three dollars more, I could've paid the bill."
Tom isn't tired.
What I really want to do is go to Boston to visit Tom.

This hat is too small for me.
Tom is my brother.
"Give it to me, please."
She is in the kitchen because she's making dinner.
What if what Tom does isn't good enough? What'll we do then?
Tom doesn't have a car and Mary doesn't either.
Tom isn't very likely to be fired for doing that.
Do you think that's wrong?
Have you made your decision?
The skin is the largest organ of the body.
"If Tom is here, you don't need to worry."
I'd like to talk to the hotel manager.
Did you get in trouble?
I want to stay in Boston for a few more days.
The poor man has no relatives.
I have a little fever.
Tom is looking for someone to help him translate a document from French into English.
Nobody knows why.
That's too expensive.
You're very timid.
What makes you cry?
How many times do I have to explain this to you?
Everybody falls in love at least once in their lives.
Tom sat motionless on a chair in the corner of the room.
Is there something in particular that you want to drink?
The cake that Tom made didn't taste good.
You start.
Send me a postcard.
We had to get something to eat so we stopped at a restaurant near the exit.

I don't think you should eat that.
His wife works at the city hall.
Who ate?
Tom is delighted.
My sister has long legs and likes sports.
This makes my blood boil.
Tom likes fish.
Thank you for helping me with my essay.
My conscience bothers me.
He told me point-blank that I was fired.
It took me several hours to iron all your shirts.
The waitress spread a white cloth over the table.
It was worth it.
Tom is practically dead.
Seriously?

She was an orphan who lost her parents in a plane crash.
The old man got off the bus.
Tom was three meters away when the bomb exploded.

What're you doing in my house?
"Hurry up, and you'll be in time for school."
Tom used to be ugly.
Tom is quite knowledgeable about modern popular music.
I think you know why I called you.
You may have made the wrong choice.
Are you trying to be funny?
They always skip school.
Are you in the library?
I'll see to it first thing tomorrow.
The boy tried to saw off the dead branch.
Don't blame Tom for what Mary did.
Have you made a decision?
That was terrible.
Check your tire pressure.
"I gave him a warning, but he took no notice of it."
I'm drinking water.
Do you want me to go now?
A bear can climb a tree.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Tom acknowledged his mistake.
Let's peek inside.
Do you see me?
Tom should still be in the library.
Have you ever baked a pizza?
What criteria do you use in deciding who to vote for?
The students laughed.
I'm so overworked.
Dragons are imaginary animals.
Maybe Tom was trying to warn us about something.
The bridge between Denmark and Sweden is almost five miles long.
Drive with the utmost care.
Boston is boring.
Tom would treat you with respect.
There comes our teacher.
I'll go tell Tom we're ready.
I was just curious.
She took some meat from the plate.
I've always distrusted Tom.
"They're very, very good."
Tom felt humiliated.
Could I talk to you alone for a second?
How can you be so optimistic?
She's fond of taking pictures.
At least the sheets are clean.
She accepted our invitation.
I usually drink a lot of milk.
He wanted to go to sea.
We had scarcely returned when it began raining.
We need to know everything that you know about the situation.

I don't like French.
I said no.
I'm glad to be here.
Can I help you find something?
They released Tom.
We've lost 3 to 0.
I had my fingers caught in the door.
Tom paid no attention to Mary at all.
He lost all his belongings.
Tom and Mary haven't decided on a date for their wedding yet.
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
Sunday is when I spend my time reading.
A big ship appeared on the horizon.
I could use a couple of days alone.
"I can afford one, but not both."
Tom asked Mary how John was doing.
What's the difference between these two?
I am not as interested in literature as you.
I wonder if Tom would mind babysitting our kids tomorrow night.
"Tom and Mary were here earlier, but now they've disappeared."
It's bulky.
We were very impressed by his new book.
He twisted my arm.
The math homework proved to be easier than I had expected.
There is no link between these two.
A squid has ten legs.
You've walked into a trap.
This book is mine.
"I couldn't sleep well last night, so I don't feel well."
Stay where you are.
I kid you not.
I'm not interested in physics at all.
The old man kept to himself.
You are old enough to take care of yourself.
Tom started packing.
Tom told me to invite you to his party.
Of course I will go.
He knows us very well.
That's a lie.
It's time for bed.
I thought you wouldn't mind waiting for me.
Did you remember to pack the sandwiches?
We can't help you.
I don't know if he will visit us next Sunday.
I'm not going to let Tom sing.
What a lucky person he is!
Tom shut the door and locked it.
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
Most of them were university students.
I don't suppose you ever really get over the death of a child.

Do you think Tom is going to agree to this?
Tom was in a coma.
Can you take a photo of us?

A lot of people are dealing with hay fever now.
I feel like you don't really care about me.

You don't have to pay attention to what Tom says.
Tom intervened in his coworkers' disagreement.
Are you interested in buying an encyclopedia?

This used to belong to Tom.

Let me know as soon as anything happens.
We have no choice. I guess we'll have to walk.
Tom drank a lot of vodka on his trip to Russia.
She got the ticket for nothing.

I'm not wasting any more time on this.
Please freeze the fish and meat.

I was a little afraid.
Their ideas seem totally alien to us.

It is said that he has a lot of old coins.
Tom's in charge.
I am ready to do anything to make up for the loss.
Tom is finally getting married.
Tom speaks French better than his classmates.
When is Tom coming?
I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley.
You seem upset.
I didn't speak for long.
I may owe you an apology.
Do you want to play with Tom?
I could write Tom a note if you want me to.
My uncle lived a happy life.
You know I don't like it when you're late.
I'd like to know how to paint like that.
I broke my right leg.
I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
Don't ask questions. Just follow me.
Everything is fine.
Why did you decide to study French?
Why don't you go get the car?
I asked him to wait here.
I've asked you repeatedly not to do that.
They're proud of me.
I received a letter written in English yesterday.
It's not a big thing.
"You're not very hungry, are you?"
There's a lot of traffic.
She appears to me to be cruel.
Tom taught Mary how to drive.
Can you keep a secret?
I don't know how to translate this word.

The man hit me on the head.
"If you had to do it all over again, what would you do differently?"
I remember everything you tell me.
I just found it.
We can't let Tom get away with murdering those four people.
I like you just the way you are.
"Once a species goes extinct, it's gone forever."
I knew I was making progress.
It's too short.
What did they do?
Here's the money I borrowed from you.
My mother can't attend.
That's why I brought it up.
It would be better for you to read more books.
He will come into a large fortune.
"Yesterday, they went to the movies."
It's just a flesh wound.
Tom's first wife was from Boston.
We were dead tired from the five-hour trip.
I saw a man with a red hat.
"Tom is kind of famous, isn't he?"
I don't have to prove anything at all.
The situation is worse than we believed.
He still wants to come.
Did you say thank you?
I wonder what it would take to get Tom to help.
You don't have to help.
"If you don't want to attend Tom's birthday party, you don't have to."
Do you need some help there?
I didn't know whether to stay here or go to London.
This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in.
Ask me tomorrow.
This is a picture of the first car I owned.
We're a little busy right now.
"If you go fishing tomorrow, I will, too."
We can't let it get out that Tom is seeing a psychiatrist.
The tires are very sticky.
Tell me what to write and I'll write it for you.
I don't care what you say.
Would you say you're a morning person?
I'm glad to see that today is such a beautiful day.
Do you see the entrance of the park?
Have you recovered from the shock?
Tom got a little pie.
Many dangers lie ahead.
We spoke briefly.

You've gotten better.

That's how the pros do it.
He has a heart condition.
Do you want to sit down for a few minutes?
The ambassador has returned.
Return at once.
He is a Japanese boy.
I went swimming in the sea.
Tom lay flat on the floor.
Do it with me.
Is it time?
You will have to wait and see.
You can't erase the past.
This is very important.
"When I got there, there was no more cake left."
Tom bought me a drink.
Are you a good dancer?
How very curious!
Memorize it.
I can't afford to buy an expensive car.
I didn't know you were that kind of a person.
Tom ran.
He was not conscious of his own mistake.
Tom told me to be there by 2:30.
"If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?"
Do you know how to solve this riddle?
Don't bother waking me up at 4:00 a.m. I don't plan to go fishing tomorrow.
How old do you think Tom is?
"Without your advice, I would have been robbed of my bag."
Could you please park somewhere else?
Please turn in the report by the end of the month.
Is the book boring?
I've already fixed that.
Promise me you'll come back.
It's impossible to fix it.
Tom is extremely unreliable.
Tom asked Mary about her new job.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.
Countless lives have been lost.
He lives in that yellow house.
Have you talked to Tom about this?
We should see each other more often.
The heavy rain caused all the trains to stop.
I should've talked to Tom first.
Tom noticed something in the distance.
Do you like the new school better?
I saw a girl with long hair.
The ladies were in evening dress.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that.
The room will be painted tomorrow.
Come along with me.
One day you'll thank me.
They took every possibility into consideration.
I have been studying English for six years now.
Tom won't survive.
He who thinks he has learned enough has learned nothing.
It wasn't easy.
Tom will contact you.
"The snow is beautiful, isn't it? ""Yeah, but Mary, you're even more beautiful."""
Tom bought a ticket for Mary.
Don't look up.
Where was Tom born?
We still need to buy some bread.
Tom will probably tell you the same thing I did.
This is by far the most interesting of his novels.
Tom seems to be busier than Mary.
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
I can't believe that Tom said such hateful things about Mary.
He led us to the station.
What do you think of his suggestion?
I don't have a dog.
You'd better not do it.
Please turn off the light.
That child's easily distracted.
Shakespeare wrote a lot of interesting plays.
The delegates voted ninety-five times without success.
Do you want to go someplace else?
The tree was struck by lightning.
"He doesn't eat this, does he?"
We'll hurry.
Are you certain about this?
I hear what you're saying.
I was dealt a good hand.
Tom didn't want to wear the shirt that his mother had gotten him for Christmas.
Not everyone is happy about this.
How do you spell your last name?
I want you and Tom working together on this.
Tom crawled through the window.
"Even with all the money he has, he isn't happy."
They're tears of joy.
So why don't you tell Tom that?
There is no regular boat service to the island.
That's what I would do in your place.
I'm kind of happy.
Wouldn't it be better if you did that by yourself?
Do you know how to play the organ?
"You think I'm wrong, don't you?"
Do we really have to eat this?
It is a very sad tale.
I glanced at his letter.
You've got your priorities backwards.
Mary received beautiful flowers from her son.
I love this school.
That which is easily acquired is easily lost.
Our trip was canceled due to the heavy snow.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You can't keep Tom from going to work today.
He knows the area like the back of his hand.
I didn't know him at the time.
I don't think I'd like it.
It's not as easy as you think.
Watch out for the pedestrians.
Tom tore up the letter he got from Mary.
Tom never was interested in sports.
He came in person.
I just stopped by to pick something up.
This road is closed to cars.
The star of the show was Tom.
Tom didn't pray.
Bad habits die hard.
Return this book as soon as you can.
I have my supper at a quarter past seven.
He had no friend to talk to.
I haven't washed my hair in a week.
The dog followed me to my home.
"Tom and Mary got divorced, just like you predicted."
Where do you want me to put this?
Tom asked me out.
The monkeys are grooming each other.
That's all I need.
She has a bicycle.
Call me whenever you want.
"Tom, hurry up. ""I'm coming!"""
Do you want me to help you with the cooking?
You guys are idiots.
It's an older model.
I anticipate that there will be problems on their expedition.
We rode a boat to the island.
Do you have any supernatural abilities?
Bees fly from flower to flower.
Let's go to Boston together.
Don't cut down those trees.
I bought a book yesterday.
"My nickname is ""Itch."""
We play soccer every Saturday.
"You understand why, don't you?"
Traveling was much more difficult in those days.

Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
She was a Smith before she got married.
How are things going with your youngest sister?
The forest fire occurred through carelessness.
Do I look like Tom to you?
My uncle gave me a book.
The rain continued all day.
When does your vacation start?
You have to ask Tom first.
We don't need your money.
Learning English requires patience.
Trust your gut.
Tom bought a webcam.
They might pay me more if I could use a computer.
I thought you set the alarm for 2:30.
He is a scientist and musician.
We've discussed this many times already.
I heard Tom split up with Mary.
I lost a lot of blood.
You're welcome to wait here.
Have a good weekend.
I feel like going on a trip.
Do you see people in the park?
I was filled with joy.
"Pass me the butter, will you please."
Tom and Mary are getting married soon.
Our visitors are at the door.
I'm not going to sing that song.
Is that the book that Tom gave you?
Look at my arm.
Come and look.
Thanks for coming by.
He showed up late to practice.
I owe my success to their help.
I hate working.
Tom bought a new car.
Tom said he knew what that was like.
I'm a slow learner.
"If you refuse, Tom will be furious."
Bring me the magazines.
He agreed to what they said.
Have you considered moving to Boston?
What makes you think Tom wants to do that?
The two men shook hands with each other the minute they were introduced.
Some people believe in ghosts.
The population of China has already exceeded 1.3 billion.
My mother is not always at home.
It's against my morals.
Every spring the river floods here.
I don't know any of her students.
Who should we believe?
Let's talk about your job.
Tom texts me all the time.
I don't want to go to the pool.
You might meet Tom.
"You don't speak English, do you?"
Don't call her now.
I read the book after I had finished my homework.
What did he do after that?
I am not older than he is.
A stray dog followed Tom home and he decided to keep it.
Such a plan can hardly succeed.
Tom came to Boston when he was thirteen years old.
What would you like to drink?
I can't attend the meeting.
How many countries are in Europe?
Sorry. I didn't mean it like that.
Tom didn't plan on going camping.
"She's smarter than Mary, but not as beautiful as Mary."
"Be polite, but firm."
We can just about read each other's minds.
I've already found a volunteer.
Tom loves doing this.
Don't you love me anymore?
Do you have a bike?
We learned about that from reliable sources.
Ghosts exist.
Tom doesn't have a lot to give.
Let's go into my office.
I spent three months in the hospital when I was thirteen.
I went as far as the post office.
Is he still here?
I'd like you to stop.
"What can I do for you, sir?"
I paid for it in euros.
What fruit would you like to have for dessert?
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The danger is minimal.
Please lend me your book.
I know who you were with.
Belgium is not as large as France.
Tom likes to talk on the phone.
I'm listening to Björk's latest song.
I didn't know you had a sister.
Would you please shut the window?
They were very shocked.
Can you correct this report before 5:00 p.m.?
Leave it off the list.
Fear of failure prevents many people from reaching their full potential.
She greeted me with a pleasant smile.
I want you to be by my side.
Do you have a five-pound note?
Origami is the art of folding paper.
I'll go there.

A good citizen obeys the laws.
Will he ever do it?
Tom is going to take you home.
All the members were present.
This one is Tom's.
I took a cab to the station.
We saw Tom do it.
There's a car coming.
Everything will turn out for the best.
The story was true.
Tom is a fool.
Is he going to help us?
It's time to get out of here.
You don't have to stay.
I don't think that technology provides us with everything we need.
What time is it over there?
He's very fond of walking.
Tom thought no one was at home.
Did he touch you?
That's foolish.
The whole class was quiet.
What drugs are they giving you?
She did not turn up after all.
Lunch is on.
"Unlike my brother, I cannot swim."
Have you told me everything?
Why did Tom kill Mary?
You're making me waste time.
My dog died last winter.
The car battery is dead.
Isn't that your dictionary?
I would like to spend the whole morning like this.
I like dogs very much.
They hired a moving company to transport their belongings to their new home.
You are not authorized to enter there.
"Unfortunately, Tom wasn't alone."
Tom put some clothes on.
"You've already decided not to go, haven't you?"
Don't make me answer that question.
We had to postpone the gathering because of rain.
I heard the good news.
I slipped on my geta and dashed outside.
There is some evidence that taking several fish oil capsules per day could have beneficial effects on one's heart and blood pressure.
What is the reason for that lie?
What do you want for breakfast?
Will you excuse us for a moment?
How about another cup of coffee?

Lie on the couch.

There is something about him I don't like.
Look into my eyes.
That program is broadcast every other week.
Tom has gone to Boston.
He has an interesting book.
You said you could speak French.
"Although it was raining, I had to go out."
I'll try to do that by myself.
Tom is dying to see you.
Tom often has nightmares.
Tom never visits Mary anymore.
Please look after my cats while I'm away.
He lied to my face.
Tom made up his mind to be a teacher.
I don't know what I'm doing.
"Possibly, it's true."
I'll catch you later.
I can't forgive any of you.
She's starting to annoy me.
I don't deny that.
"You never learn, do you?"
Tom sang badly on purpose.
Tom lives really far from here.
He never listens to what his father says.
I'm sleeping.
"Judging from the look of the sky, it will be fine tomorrow."
She always keeps her promises.
Doesn't Tom want to go with us?
There were two murders this month.
My car is at your disposal.
I don't have anything.
Tom couldn't have done that without your help.
I have things to do tomorrow.
Tom pretended he hadn't heard what Mary had said about him.
Why did you kiss me?
My grandfather is fond of taking a walk early in the morning.
I have to do my best.
Do you have your own apartment?
That's always a good sign.
I would like to meet you.
I am planting beans in my garden.
Tom is a risk taker.
That's where I live.
Tom lied to me.
He seems to have caught a cold.
I was very impressed by Tom's good behavior.
I don't know whether Tom will come or not.
Swimming is my hobby.
Don't overexert yourself.
Has there been any change in policy?
I can teach you how to do this.
Tom will be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
I often see him taking a walk in this neighborhood.
Tom thought Mary was asleep.
That's the silliest thing I've ever heard.
I've been sneezing all day.
Tom often talks with Mary.
I don't remember inviting you here.
"Your letter reached me only today, having been delayed by the heavy snow."
Was Tom working yesterday?
There's something I have to tell you.
Please repeat after me.
Are you going to buy the car?
The sky was full of clouds that night.
He's a friend from work.
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us.
He drank it in one gulp.
I had a wonderful time in Boston.
I like speaking in French.
I coughed up blood.
I'm looking for my passport. Have you seen it?
Do you drink beer or wine?
"Since I was sleepy, I went to sleep."
"Apparently, I was wrong."
Things are clearer in the morning than in the evening.
Give Tom the money.
I forget his name.
This collar's too tight.
Tom looks ashamed.
I'd like a ticket to Boston.
Tom was shy at first.
"When I was your age, I bicycled to and from school every day."
Tom often walks around the house without any clothes on.
Tom said he'd call at 2:30.
Tom regretted lying to Mary.
You're very talented.
Do you want to come in?
"Hi. You're Tom, right? It's been a while."
Tom has forgotten his umbrella again.
No students could answer the question.
Tom didn't seem to mind.
I don't find her particularly attractive.
I saw Tom in Boston.

He readily agreed to it.
We prepared for an attack.
I had to hide.
Never leave your drink unattended.
