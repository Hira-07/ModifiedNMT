I'm going to see him tomorrow.
There are people here who need your help.
Tom said he'd had nothing to do with what had happened.
Your outrage is completely justified.
There aren't many good tunes coming out nowadays.
I suggest you begin at once.
"It's sad, but true."
I wholeheartedly agree.
Tom is frightened.
Tom's turn came.
Do you like this wallet?
I can't really be certain that Tom didn't take the money.
I'll let everybody know.
I can teach you things.
I don't think that Tom was hiding.
Tom works every day except Sunday.
Don't hurt him.
We can't see Mt. Fuji from here.
I go to school on foot.
Tom called me a scaredy-cat.
"You'll like it, believe me."
I'm very grateful for your help.
Did you order the book?
Tom still hasn't found a good job.
She raised her hands.
Put some clothes on.
How did you know I was Canadian?
I wonder who can swim fastest.
Mary tied an apron around her waist and then took the turkey out of the oven.
"Here you are, Tom."
What do people usually do in the summer around here?
I have a job interview at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Get out of my bed.
You don't know what Tom is like.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
Tom adds a little money to his savings account each month.
"In spite of his tight schedule, Tom always has time to spend with his children."
It doesn't matter when you come.
I saw an airplane.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
There are plenty of places around here for someone to hide.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Is she healthy?
He was blinded in an accident.
Have you heard from him?
You can answer it.
Tom jumped into the pool.
I'll phone you later.
I came to congratulate you.
At least I wasn't alone.
The road curves gently towards the west.
She takes cooking lessons once a week.
Don't you have two computers?
"Having finished it, he went to bed."
Tom fed his leftovers to his dog.
"If a cut is bleeding, put pressure on it."
I am very hungry.
This is the most beautiful lake that I have ever seen.
Take this book back to him.
What's the most fun you've ever had?
Beijing is the capital of China.
Do you think it'll rain today?
I would like to visit the Great Wall this year.
Things like that happen.
We can't just sit here.
You'll like it.
"If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner."
We knew this.
I feel terrible about ruining your party.
I need to finish packing.
We are here because we have a right to be involved in these decisions.
I couldn't get to sleep.
Wait for me in the meeting room.
I saw Tom in there.
You look horrible.
I don't know Tom's last name.
I don't want you to think I'm nuts.
Tom has one brother.
I asked you not to play with that.
No passengers were killed in the accident.
My computer stopped working a few days ago.
Tom didn't have enough experience in dealing with that kind of problem.
I guess theoretically it's possible.
Tom had to wait in line for three hours.
Tom isn't always late.
Tom was unable to decide who he should vote for.
Tom probably didn't do the work himself.
You know Tom is telling the truth.
The villagers believed in a life after death.
Come at once.
It will be quitting time before you get that done.
They stopped talking as soon as I came into the room.
You're not thinking.
You have to keep your promise.
She soon adjusted herself to the new school.
We could not resist the force of his logic.
Take over.
Do you have any employees who speak French?
Tom is still active.
Could you tell me my balance?
London is the capital of the United Kingdom.
"In the summer, we enjoy outdoor sports."
We have to get a new one.
I never promised you anything.
Tom said he'd do that for Mary.
I really wish to see you today.
There's only one way to be sure.
Don't ask her any questions about her marriage.
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
Tom said that he saw Mary playing badminton with John.
She gave me a dirty look.
Bring me a glass of water.
Tom didn't get up before six.
Leave it to me.
Tom looked back.
There was only one bottle of beer in the fridge.
I wish you didn't do that.
We didn't go to Boston.
Tom does that because he has to.
There's a little bit of water in the glass.
I want to see more.
You should receive them by the end of the week.
I located the town on a map.
"I don't know if it will be fine tomorrow, but if it is fine we'll go on a picnic."
Would you please tell me how to spell that word?
Did you get that ticket from Tom?
I'm an atheist.
Tom understood that.
You won't have any more trouble with Tom.
See you at home.
Is it hot enough for you?
That's the way Tom always does it.
"Tom, weren't you supposed to invite only one friend?"
Don't you want to know?
"Of all the things Tom did last weekend, he says that windsurfing was the most fun."
She forgave him.
What is your name?
Do you have money?
How often do you go abroad?
Tom didn't want to lose.
I have just had one of the worst days of my life.
I will do it on condition that I am paid.
Tom is here with us.
Can Tom help us?
Tom isn't an expert.
Will you please lend me a stapler?
That's just what you need now.
Tom broke one of the rules and was kicked out of school.
I rode the elevator to the third level.
School is a waste of time.
He received a good education in England.
Are you telling me how to do my job?
My taxi should be here soon.
He tricked her into agreeing to his proposal.
"Once bitten, twice shy."
Both countries are now at peace.
Tom tried to catch the chicken.
You are a genius.
We keep in touch.
He boils water in a coffee pot.
Don't make me say it again.
I still haven't learned to drive a car.
Mary can cook anything without using a recipe.
The good news is that you're not going to die.
Let's pray.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
She handed him a book.
Get back in the house.
The constant border wars between England and Scotland came to an end.
The number of Europeans who visit Thailand every year is very large.
I want you to go with Tom.
Tom met Mary on his way to school.
Don't leave the TV on.
Tom is not my son.
That's beside the point.
Thanks for notifying me.
I don't want your help.
Tom realized Mary was deliberately avoiding him.
Tom said he'd come.
She killed herself at the age of thirty.
Tom lives on the same street as Mary.
It is a black hole.
I don’t believe that black cats cause bad luck.
Please try to stay calm.
"He was pressed for time, so he only skimmed through the morning paper before rushing out the door."
I just want to know what happened.
Tom is Mary's neighbor.
Take her to the OR.
Tom is going to do it.
Someone should talk to him and tell him what's what.
I got to know Tom when I was in college.
Can you tell me who they are?
Nothing is more disappointing than to lose in the finals.
What happened to the others?
You should probably go.
He exposed himself to the ridicule of his classmates.
This classroom is very large.
It'll only take a few minutes.
Could I ask you a big favor?
Traveling is easy these days.
Tom will just laugh at us.
I'd like to sleep a little longer.
Boston has grown rapidly in the last ten years.
Do you believe in the power of love?
My apartment is too small.
Let me take a gander.
He hurt himself during yesterday's game.
Our family doesn't celebrate Christmas.
I don't have any money.
I'd like some coffee.
Can you frame this picture?
I have to feed my cat.
Some things are better not said.
Do you like Japanese food?
"Hey, don't go."
Tom and Mary walked down the street holding hands.
The revision of this dictionary took six years.
Tom says that he didn't study at all for the test.
The bus you want doesn't stop here.
Japanese people are fortunate to live in a land with natural hot springs.
How did you come up with this crazy idea?
Do not forget to meet me at the station.
I haven't touched a tennis racket in years.
Turn the sound off.
Be objective.
Is it taking too long?
Tom always keeps a map in the glove compartment.
Tom became an orphan when he was three.
I thought this was important.
Why is there so much violence in the world?
"If you want me to help you, all you have to do is ask."
Tom is good for nothing.
He's about to leave.
Raise your left hand.
Have you always been so selfish?
"It was hard for me to sell my guitar, but I needed the money."
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before.
The baby fell asleep in the cradle.
This watch is twice as expensive as that one.
Tom is obsessive.
I want to know who you are.
Tom and I have been friends for many years.
My name should be on that list.
I know you're not like Tom.
The money will probably be split evenly between those two.
We'll be able to go on when it clears up.
All drugs of addiction increase the release of dopamine in the brain.
The hotel where we stayed was very comfortable.
I don't know anybody in this town.
The plane flew above the clouds.
I used to keep a diary in English when I was a student.
My wallet's gone.
Do you like bowling?
Maybe we're overlooking the obvious.
We aren't alone.
Tom always seems to be short of money.
You're surrounded.
Context is important.
"Tom is drinking tea, isn't he?"
It's easy to catch a cold.
Do you think she can handle her staff?
Tom got run over by a truck.
Was the soup tasty?
This game was put off.
I'll tell you what it is.
Why do you always wear that hat?
I helped Tom wash the dishes.
Look before you leap.
I don't get what you mean.
I hope that is not the case.
Does Tom like tomatoes?
They were everywhere.
We're having a barbecue.
Everyone is welcome to participate.
I can't force you to testify.
Tom got a job.
I took the elevator to the fourth floor.
I need hand lotion.
This is true of adults as well as of children.
This blue sweater is very pretty.
Somebody left the lights on.
The world is not what it used to be.
You must not smoke.
"This is good, isn't it?"
Can I borrow your car?
Do you promise not to tell anybody anything?
Please turn on the TV.
I'm almost finished reading this book.
It won't take long to read that book.
Mary slipped off her robe and got into the shower.
She lives nearby.
The problem is beyond the scope of my understanding.
Do you want to stop?
You weren't wrong.
"I think Tom understands that if he wants my help, all he needs to do is ask for it."
I didn't learn very much.
It's you who are confused.
Do exactly as I say.
Get to work.
"I'd like you to meet my sister, Mary."
"If you don't believe me, ask Tom."
You won't find what you're looking for here.
How much beer people drink largely depends on the weather.
The program will finish with the national anthem.
Tom played Reveille on his bugle every morning.
I resigned.
That store sells newspapers and magazines.
I feel fine.
He presented his card.
I used to eat a lot of meat.
It was pretty close.
There's something I'd like to show you.
I'm an American citizen.
I was really scared.
Would you mind if we discussed this later?
I agree with you.
The politician was not ashamed of having taken bribes.
I thought something was odd.
I don't feel like studying at all tonight.
Would you like to take a walk with me?
Is it too complicated?
Tom is sloshed.
Mary is my older sister.
The meeting ended at three in the afternoon.
You need to try a little harder.
The party's over.
I'm never too busy for you.
I didn't think I'd be able to find a job here in Boston.
Tom drinks too much.
It rained all day yesterday.
Tom surprised Mary with a kiss.
"When his business failed, he was left penniless."
Where's my comb?
Can we swim here?
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
Hold it with both hands.
What do you want for breakfast?
He wants to talk to you.
You should keep your valuables in a safe place.
I want one!
He showed what he meant.
I asked Tom why he did it.
Can you order it for me?
Tom likes talking about himself.
The old man told me a strange story.
They aren't afraid of death.
I hated spinach when I was a kid.
I could fire you for that.
It's a bit greasy.
Tom has been badly wounded.
I want a tie to go with this suit.
"If you could do it, would you?"
We might not need to sell our house.
The exception proves the rule.
Let's leave as soon as Tom gets here.
We are working hard to make up for lost time.
The man was given a life sentence.
Women feel that men are often very complicated.
You can't let that come between you and Tom.
This kind of work requires a lot of patience.
I want a book.

I'd like to be friends.
"Listen, I have to go."
I don't like it at all.
Drinking on an empty stomach is bad for your health.

How old do you think she is?
I was searching for something that didn't exist.
I wear jeans almost every day.
Tom drove his children to soccer practice.
Bring your children along.
The river has its source in the Rocky Mountains.

Tom dropped his cup and broke it.
"He is a good violinist, isn't he?"
What's up with you today?
We have to make sure Tom doesn't do that.
I promised to send Tom a letter.
I don't think Tom did that.
Where did we leave off last time?
Give it to someone who needs it.
I don't let Tom go swimming by himself.

I can't see the stage from this seat.
What was it all about?

I like rain and snow.
Can you tell us about it?
It's a good plan.
She cooked us a wonderful meal.
Write a poem with three four line stanzas.
That makes sense to me.

Another thing that is required is a dictionary.
She is proud of her son.
I usually get up at about six-thirty.

Few people know about the plan.

We're journalists.

I usually go to school by bus.
I must be leaving now.
Yours is over there.
I think you know what I want.
"Like Tom said, this is a waste of time."
She beat him to death.
We have no secrets from each other.
I wonder where Tom has gone.
Trade between the two countries has been steadily growing.
What time does she get up?

It's rather cold today.
Do you love each other?
They will understand.
He is in college.
I'm going to take good care of you.

Not all of the boys laughed at him.
My uncle is angry.

"Excuse me, how much is this?"
What makes you think that Tom's interested in helping us?
I'll give Tom one more chance.
Tom is looking at me funny.
I wasn't sure what you meant.
The store was crowded with holiday shoppers.
I always photograph badly.
The soldiers are dead.
You'll understand it right away.
It isn't hard to do.
Don't risk your fortune on that.

He laughed for no reason.
Do you think it'll be that easy?
I can't die here.
He's a high school student.
We can't see each other for a while.
I plan to stay in Boston for another three days.
That bridge is very beautiful.
When did you ask Tom?
Tom never took his eyes off Mary.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Wake up!
He played tennis.
Do you want some soup?
What was that sound?
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
I think you're exaggerating.
What's your favorite commercial?
Tom stared at Mary in disbelief.
It's not going to be easy.

Who remembers?
You've already explained that.
Religion was very important in the Middle Ages.

"If you want to master a language, you need to learn to think in that language."

Tom is looking at you.
I said take it.

Tom has two sisters.
You're on your own.
Mary is putting her face on.
What time did you arrive there?
I found the game very exciting.
I know who lives in this house.
I hear voices in my head.
I don't know what has happened to him.
None of that was true.
It was unpardonable.
Turn the knob and open the door.
He will arrive in Paris tomorrow.
Tom couldn't go anywhere else.
What's your favorite drink?
I'll prove it.
Tom sighed.
We were caught off guard.
We're optimists.
He forgot to turn off the light.
I'm halfway through this crime novel.
I'll visit him tomorrow.
I thought maybe you could tell me what I need to know.
Would you like a cupcake?
I don't know what to tell you.
That's what I'm talking about.
When was the last time you saw Tom at school?
I expected you home three hours ago.
I do not watch television.
I hear that you're very good at what you do.
Tom has a big box of stuff in my attic.

My father usually watches television after dinner.
Why are you so secretive?
Tom often munches on snacks while watching TV.
"When my mother was young, she was very beautiful."
He interpreted for me.
I like French cooking.
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday?
We haven't yet done everything we need to do.
So what is everyone's problem?
The movie was good.
Tom certainly has some pretty old-fashioned ideas.
You should pay attention.
Do you want to hear it?
He is making cookies.
I just moved here.
Why doesn't anybody answer?
"Today, I had a lot of troubles."
You'd better go.
Tom pointed to the chair next to his.
I want to change.
She had long hair last year.
A screen divided the room into two.
You left your lights on.
Tom is courteous.
Could you suggest a good beauty parlor near here?

The crow flew away.
I can't speak either French or English.
The examinations are all over.
Don't break it.

"In swimming pools, water is continuously pumped through a filter."
Tom said that he thought Mary might need to do that today.
How old is your little brother?
Tom gave Mary the benefit of the doubt.
"As you already know, I don't speak French very well, so I'd rather not give a speech in French."
Did you warn Tom?
This should be clear to everyone.
Tom isn't like that.
We can't do this anymore.
You won't be needing that where you're going.
Tom likes it there.
Tom may be there.
I found it difficult to please her.
I'd rather not do this anymore.
You've grown up.
I don't need to buy a suit for the wedding because Tom has one he can lend me.
French is spoken in a part of Canada.
Mary is the prettiest woman I know.
They had no alternative energy sources.
How shall we deal with the problem?
Who let you in here?
Can you help me find my daughter?
What are you doing in my office?
Tom knew he was going to win.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction.
Mary is a hula dancer.
I don't want to leave Boston.
You could drive home by yourself.
Why didn't you tell us you knew French?
My back hurts because I've been fishing all day.
Tom bought a newspaper.
Don't forget your umbrella.
It's already dark outside.
Close the door on your way out.
"Not knowing what to say, she remained silent."
You don't need to get a haircut this week.
No one knew a thing.
It couldn't hurt.
I have no idea of what it is like.
Is this your favorite song?
I'm thinking about you.
Tom and Mary nod at each other knowingly.
Is that Tom's car?
I was beginning to worry.
I had no difficulty finding your house.
I feed my dog once a day.
Your room is twice the size of mine.
I feel a little responsible.
Tom came over while you were asleep.
There's a cold wind from the north.
Tom wants to talk to you again.
Tom is smiling.
Here's to a long and happy life!
I worked in this factory.
"At that time, we were quite rich."
Perhaps I was wrong.
A big bridge was built over the river.
Don't give this to anybody.
It is no exaggeration to say that he is a genius.
Pilots communicate with the airport by radio.
It was never my intention to hurt you.
They are inseparable.
Tom is mixing flour with sugar.
I won't talk to you.
Tom had open heart surgery.
You'll be busy tomorrow.
Don't even think about it.
Come whenever you want to.
We want to take your blood pressure.
It sure is cold today.
Why do you need to read such a book?
Please speak French.
She speaks a little Arabic.
He seems to have been sick last week.
We're asking you not to do that.
I will play football tomorrow.
"Tom came into the room, followed by John and Mary."
You're very sharp.
Tom could see Mary from where he stood.
What's Tom writing?
I went to the station.
Tom wants to know when you're coming.
What do you think of this one?
I can't order Tom to do it.
Do you want to see a picture of Tom?
She gave me a present.
"I knew I shouldn't have done it, but I did it anyways."
Tom rolled up the poster and put it into a cardboard tube.
Contact Tom.
Tom said he didn't have time to read the newspaper this morning.
Love of money is the root of all evil.
I came near to getting involved in a crime.
"Language learning software, no matter how nice it looks and works, is only as good as the data it uses."

It's an ecological disaster.
You should chew your food well.
Are you bilingual?
I like to walk in the mountains.
My parents will be happy.
Precise measurements are needed.
"I don't know how, but you did it."
You're not dead.
Tom knows what he wants.
It's not just a theory.
Tom decided to wait until Mary had some free time.
Where's the bass player?
He is pleased with his new shoes.
Did you enjoy the game?
We call our dog Pochi.

The children are playing with toys.
His condition got worse every day.
Take off your wet clothes.
He took charge of the expenses.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a secluded beach.
What are you making?
The baby is sucking his finger.

You have more energy than I do.

"Can Tom play the trumpet? ""No, but he's a pretty good singer."""
I hate to see animals suffer.
I would like to retract my previous statement.
It has been three months since he left Japan.
Did you like this book?
Look behind you.
"It doesn't matter whether I'm sleeping or awake, I'm always thinking about you."
"Surrounded by the sea, Japan has a mild climate."
We'll find out who did this.
Tom was eating a sandwich.
I want to live in a small town.
There has to be a first time for everything.
Fill in the blanks.
Tom got his painting framed.
The old man stopped suddenly and looked back.
Could you explain to me what happened?
He looked quite tired.
I'm tired and I want to go to bed.
"In America, we believe that a lifetime of hard work and responsibility should be rewarded with a shot at a secure, dignified retirement."
This building is huge.
Get back in there.
She is two years older than you.
I've never heard of such a thing.
"Her library has 3,500 books and includes many first editions."
I will go swimming tomorrow.
I don't need your help.
Tom has enough time.
I can't figure out your motives.
Tom will be staying with us for the next three weeks.
I hope that this isn't a mistake.
The watch on the desk is mine.
She played the piano beautifully.
I meant you no harm.
What are you guys still doing here?
Where is the bank?
Tom and Mary worked in a coal mine as children.
He could not answer that question.
We've had this discussion already.
I can teach you how to dance.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
They haven't changed their mind.
Tom's a very pessimistic person and always sees the negative side of any situation.
A heavy rain fell.
The world doesn't revolve around you.
I have no desire to go there.
I have three dogs.
The hotel's full of foreigners.
Did you bring a weapon?
Tom pulled a box from under the bed.
Tom hardly ever speaks to us anymore.
He won't live a long life.
Computer supplies are very expensive in Japan.
I'd like to talk to the doctor alone for a moment.
I could do with some rest.
Tom is making dinner.
Do you see a rose?
His aunt looks young.
I have no time for reading.
Do you think her story is false?
Tom wants his children to learn French.
"After the meal, I asked for the bill."
He was accused of murder.
Mary isn't really sick. She's only pretending to be.
Tom must have heard our voices and escaped.
First impressions can often be misleading.
He has a drug allergy.
You can't leave until we say you can leave.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I agree to his plan.
When's dinner served?
Tom didn't seem inclined to elaborate and I didn't really want to know all the details anyway.
The customer is always right.
Do you hear that?
Tom hurried to catch up with Mary.
Tom said we should start early.
"You're very rich, aren't you?"
He is teaching Arabic.
It's a step in the right direction.
This song is a love song.
Some farmers are using donkeys to protect their sheep from wild dogs.
The plane was delayed on account of bad weather.
The French like to eat snails.
Don't believe that. It's all a fairy tale.
We talked for hours on the phone.
I know the girl.
"If you go by bus, you can get there in about one-third of the time."
They really know how to throw a party!
I don't remember when and where I met you.
I'm looking for someone who can speak Portuguese.
I can't carry on like this.
I don't need reminding.
There wasn't even one book in the room.
I wish I had this problem.
I could've helped you.
How long will you be in Boston?
Tom showed Mary how to sharpen a knife.
"You were in love with Tom, weren't you?"
You're being evasive.
You do good work.
They eat meat once a week.
I returned home from Boston yesterday.
It happened by accident.
What motivated you?
It is no use arguing with him about it.
Tom put his books in his locker.
I'd be crazy to expect such a thing.
You have our full support.
My father has given up smoking recently.
Tom's French has gotten better.
Make sure you apologize.
Do it this way.
Mary looks cute no matter what she wears.
Some of them are my friends.
It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
I know exactly what needs to be done.
My flight arrived at 2:30 p.m.
We desperately need drinking water.
I came to tell you not to worry.
Tom submitted a list of topics for possible inclusion on the agenda for the annual general meeting.
I advised you not to buy this house.
It's dangerous to climb a mountain in bad weather.
Tom is likely to still be in his office.
Do you have to go now?
I can hear Tom's voice.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
What's Tom drinking?
It doesn't bother me to walk in the rain.
Tom isn't afraid to fail.
Tom spends a lot of money traveling.
Please promise me you won't do that again.
I've been waiting all day for you.
Do whatever you want to do.
I reached my goal.
Don't forget your ticket.
Were you busy yesterday?
Please give me a glass of water.
Tom kissed Mary goodbye.
"If you do not leave this area, we are authorized to remove you by force."
It is still a mystery why he suddenly left the town.
Have you ever lent your car to someone?
We've arrived.
Wealthy older men often marry younger trophy wives.
Where did she buy books?
We're the only ones here.
Tom doesn't blame Mary for getting angry.
This is my father.
He founded the school five years ago.
"The last time you saw her, she was just a tiny baby."
Tom began to look into the problem as soon as Mary brought it to his attention.
Tom is illogical.
The bus stopped to pick up passengers.
When did you join the force?
The room was devoid of furniture.
It looks like Tom.
There's something that I want to do before I leave.
"Whatever you do, don't do that with Tom."
"Tom was obsessed by the belief that, one by one, everyone around him was being abducted and replaced by aliens."
Those students are Canadians.
I'm still the same person I used to be.
Don't talk about this to anyone.
I'm beginning to lose my patience.
Tom got evaluated.
Tom says he's OK.
She invited me to her home.
Doing that should be possible.
What do you think I should've said?
Tom sat on the side of his bed and pulled on his socks.
The price of rice rose by three percent.
Please don't speak so fast.
That was enough.
Tom went back to his bedroom.
I'm a beginner in Esperanto.
We did nothing wrong.
The teacher warned us that the test would be hard.
I wish you wouldn't call me that.
This is one of the things he always says.
I think Mary was the prettiest girl in our class when we were in the third grade.
"The bank has loaned the company $1,000,000."
You'd better tell him the truth.
There is a desk in a corner of the room.
I just need to blow off some steam.
Tom refused to go to bed.
"You can do it, can't you?"
Please keep quiet.
She treated him like a king.
We should really get going.
Please relax.
They are very cheerful.
What's your favorite game?
I don't need anyone.
Tom was in Boston when the war began.
Am I supposed to be at the meeting on Monday?
I talked to friends.
Going to college doesn't guarantee you a good job.
Tom and Mary are now divorced.
Mary told Tom she didn't want him to date other women.
You didn't need to come.
"I'd be happy here, I think."
Tom designed this.
Recently I've been feeling a bit down.
We're horrible.
The roads are jammed with cars.
He couldn't bear the heat.
How could you do that?
We can't let this ruin our friendship.
Where were you yesterday at 2:30?
Do what the doctor said.
Young children are often fascinated by science.
I got out of the taxi.
Don't tell anyone this.
Their house is far from the station.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom has heartburn.
I'll attend the next meeting.
My children are in school.
That's what I said to Tom.
Do you know us?
Where is the nearest supermarket?
He speaks Japanese as if he were Japanese.
She advised him to become a teacher.
"In the next four years, 15 billion euros must be saved."
This book is a fascinating read.
I wish you would let Tom go with us.
Tom is laughing at me.
That's our secret.
All you have to do is give him a little help.
I can't even remember what his name was.
Can you swim at all?
You should protect your eyes from direct sunlight.
Tom listened to the announcement.
What've you done with my mobile phone?
His aim is to become a doctor.
Please do not kill me.
How do you know that?
I had to protect Tom from Mary.
Tom spoke into the microphone.
Tom's passport has been stolen.
I brush my teeth with a toothbrush.
Where can I buy books?
The baseball game was so exciting that everyone stayed until the very end.
Do you do this every day?
You look pretty drunk.
She forgave him.
Tom wasn't sick.
Tom realized he had no choice.
"Whatever happens, you're never going to find out."
We must learn to work together.
I don't have a lot of time.
They made me go there alone.
Tom tried to contact Mary.
What does the future hold?
You shouldn't make fun of Tom.
Tom thought I knew Mary.
Stop fighting!
I bought a watch.
I'll leave you alone now.
We have a lot of snow in the winter.
Please tell me where we're going.
I don't want to live here anymore.
"Boil my eggs hard, please."
You should be able to walk in a few days.
I haven't heard that word in a long time.
"Tom can speak French, too."
It is strange that he should have done such a thing.
I hope it won't be long before I hear from her.
I'll only be a second.
I'm doing what I love to do.
Tom attracted a crowd of children as soon as he started playing his bongos.
Your question is hard to answer.
Is Boston very far away?
Why aren't you with the others?
Leave it to me. I'll see to it.
Mary wants to be treated like a princess.
Tom lives downstream from Mary.
I wonder if there's a connection.
Do you go running every day?
"I enjoyed it, too."
Tom is reserved.
Excuse my clumsiness.
Tom has more money than I do.
A strange man came up to us.
I will do what I need to do.
This plan will be very expensive to carry out.
We want to come back.
I talked to Tom's neighbors and co-workers.
Try to remember.
We are doomed.
He used to meditate in the morning.
I met him by accident at the airport yesterday.
I can't talk now. I'm too busy.
Look ahead.
There's a yellow rose.
Tom didn't want to do that.
I sometimes play tennis with her.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
Lost time is irretrievable.
Are you sure you want to do this?
You don't have to say you love me.
I like going to Boston.
I'm no liar.
Are you watching me?
How much is this T-shirt?
I really hope Tom comes back.
That can't be denied.
Will the fine weather keep up till tomorrow?
Get away!
Lightning precedes thunder.
I suppose you're hungry.
That's all I can tell you.
That's an overly optimistic view.
He kissed me on the forehead.
We should bring another bottle of wine.
I bought a smartphone for my wife.
I'd like to ask Tom what he means.
The success of the enterprise astonished everybody.
The room is being painted by him.
"It's been nice talking to you, but I really must go now."
We always walk by the post office on the way to work.
Tom didn't leave the door open.
He talks as though he knew everything.
Please put your bag under your seat.
That's just what one would expect of him.
You didn't have any choice.
I love being alone.
Give him time.
You can't ignore Tom's request.
Don't put books on the table.
It will not last more than three minutes.
Tom took risks.
The beaches are less crowded in September.
"If the shop is closed today, I'll try again tomorrow."
Nobody tried to help Tom.
We must look at the problem from a global point of view.
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom.
Is there anything special I can do for you?
Your dress is very nice.
"Suppose your father saw us together, what would he say?"
This cave is full of bats.
Would you like to play tennis on Sunday?
I'm coming right away.

That explains it.
I think it's time for me to change jobs.

There is not much difference between the two.
We're afraid.
Do you think Tom saw Mary?
"We don't know where Tom is, but we need to find him as soon as we can."
The store closes at eleven.
Tom slept later than usual.
Are you a natural blonde?
You know what to do.

I started to cry.
They refused to be drafted.
Here's what we're going to do.
Are you afraid of heights?
The food was wonderful.
When did you get this new furniture?
This book is very heavy.
We're likely going to have a difficult time doing that.

It's so heavy that I can't lift it.
Tom will call back.
"Tom, don't leave."
The forensic technician found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.
What are you trying to protect me from?

I saw someone.
Hold the ball with both hands.
I feel like another beer.
How many apples do you want?
I won't come.
It looks like we fell into a trap.
Tom has many talents.
She has a lot of friends here.
I've finally learned how to do that.
Tom knows this place.
Tom is at the hotel now.
He is often late for school.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
What do you say?
I've found the answer.
Tom kept silent all day.
I don't see why I had to come along.
They all look the same.
You look like your father looked thirty years ago.
His name is Tom and he's Mary's husband.
Why does everyone think that I'm stupid?
There were no signs of life on the island.
I dropped my earring.
Tom says that he hasn't made up his mind yet.
Tom didn't think you would like the idea.
Are you sure about this?
"Tom seems quite busy, doesn't he?"
It was careless of me to do something like that.
I have known Tom since I was a little boy.
Is this a river?
My daughter's driving me crazy.
I graduated from the University of Kyoto.
I'll go get Tom.
How did you persuade Tom to help us?
Please remember to mail the letter.
The owner of the small dog gripped its neck and scolded it.
I had to climb over the wall.
You've gotten better.
Do you still suffer from headaches?
That's why we have to stay.
This is what you have to do.
Who speaks French?
Don't leave the window open.
You're not working here anymore.
I think they have been married for five years.
May I ask you a personal question?
Could you let me see your notes?
How do you know that Tom is undressing you with his eyes?
Tom and I are going to be there.
I was born and raised in the country.
I don't have anything to do right now.
I see why Tom doesn't like you.
Do you have any idea who would do this?
It happened last year.
He's always late to meetings.
I'm glad that you asked Tom for advice.
I was out celebrating.
My daughter came to see me from time to time.
"Tom wanted to stick around to see what would happen. Unfortunately, he had to leave."
I was planning on telling you today.
This cat doesn't chase rats.
She's busy now and can't talk with you.
Is it this hot every day?
Tom whistled a tune as he walked down the street.
Somebody is playing the piano.
I'll make you happy.
She didn't have much money.
How dare you talk to me like that!
You don't seem very pleased.
Promise me you'll be careful.
You should wash your face.
Tom has hired a lawyer.
A fire broke out in the middle of the city.
"What's your decision? ""Can I sleep on it?"""
Everything is expensive here.
She went off with her friends.
You have plenty of time.
I agree with your proposal.
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
They rented the upstairs room to a student.
Tom needs to change his attitude.
Tom fell flat on the floor.
Why do you hate me?
I'm doing fine.
We have an open relationship.
"To see him talk, you might think he's a girl."
I had fun doing this.
The arrow indicates the way to go.
I asked him if he would help me.
He is afraid of making mistakes.
You know how it is.
I knew it.
You have to give three months' rent as a deposit.
I have two gifts for friends.
Hello everyone!
Tom looked at himself in the mirror.
Keep it on you.
This is not a dating website.
I don't want to get involved in that business.
Tell her that I am waiting for her.
I do not love him anymore.
The two gunshot victims are in the intensive care unit at a nearby hospital.
He is not up to the task.
I can't even remember what his name was.
Listen to me carefully.
Why quit now?
I'll hang my coat up behind the door.
You spend too much time in front of your computer.
Is your brother's name Tom?
Something is still not right.
DNA tests showed he was innocent.
I study art history.
I'm going to change into more comfortable clothes.
You are blushing.
Tom is consoling Mary.
I didn't have the heart to tell Tom what had happened.
You're better than I am.
I can meet you at the bus station.
Thank God I survived.
You're such a pig.
Tom read a self-help book.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
Tom went to Boston yesterday.
"He's not lazy. On the contrary, I think he's a hard worker."
Do you regret getting that tattoo?
I think Tom hates my dog.
You have to go on living.

He translated a Japanese novel into French.
This is none of your business.
The prisoners fled from the concentration camp.
Tom thought Mary was kidding him.
How do magnets work?

This sort of thing doesn't usually happen.
That's just a lie.
Hold the racket tight.
Tom reads slowly.
Should I wash the lettuce?
Are you sleeping?
Tom is a person I really admire.
Tom drowned in Lake Superior three years ago.
School was fun today.
He is a mathematical genius.
I don't need anything.
Tom wants Mary to go to Boston with him.
I've seen my dog sneeze but never my cat.
I think I'm the only one working here who can speak French.
"If you don't want to do this, you don't have to."
It's to your advantage to learn everything you can.

Don't you have anything smaller than this?
I fell asleep in class yesterday.
You should write Tom a note.
I'm studying French now.
I am honored to be awarded this prize.
Tom has a sister about your age.
I've seen that.
She went home.
I did that already.
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary.
I don't quite follow you.
Tom pushed Mary into the pool.
I don't want that and I know you don't want that either.
I think he is a doctor.
You're deceiving yourself.
It was raining so hard that we decided to stay home.
It was worth a try.
Tom doesn't have any idea what Mary is thinking.
The coffee is hot.
Tom got Mary drunk.
I will play tennis this afternoon.
Tom suffocated Mary with a plastic bag.
You've frightened Tom.
I'm a suspect.
I believed in Tom.

That doesn't make sense.
Have you ever lost?
I took care of my sick sister.
Tom gave Mary some advice on how to pass multiple-choice tests.
We will accept your conditions.
Tom is clearly upset.
Do you wear shoes indoors?
Why didn't you call?
She had only a small sum of money.
I will get you a bicycle for your birthday.
Tom is probably lost.
I feel like I know you.
Isn't it perfect?
Leave a margin on the paper when you write.
We flew across the Atlantic.
Tom is trying not to get in anybody's way.
Tom set a trap.
Soccer is very popular among Japanese students.
I know where I'm going next.
Tom dried his face with a towel.
Can you get me another pencil?

Just ignore it.
This hall holds two thousand people.
I'd like to see some proof.
That girl's eyes are blue.
Tom is shoveling snow outside.
I'm at the hospital now.
"Even though I studied French for three years in school, I'm not good at speaking it."
I look forward to seeing you again.
That would be a waste of her talent.

Look after yourself.

I'll get even with you for this insult!
We'll have to try again.

Tom has a very good memory.
That's really sad.
Where do you work now?

It is up to you whether to buy it or not.

Everybody is alive.
You missed a spot.

The bug is still alive.
You have to audition to join the choir.
Have you ever traveled by air?
Please turn off the gas.
How long have Tom and Mary known each other?
I prefer that dress to this one.
There is no scientific basis for these claims.
Tom is an adult.
Drive faster.
"For as long as Tom could remember, his parents had been overweight."
She doesn't seem happy.
Did you remember to buy sugar?
Try to smile.
Our team is still undefeated.
How do you know this?
A policeman asked the girls if the car was theirs.
This hairstyle was popular in the 1990s.
Don't look at me that way.

One of Tom's problems is that he can't read.
You can't deny it.

Was it really worth it?
A swallow flies very swiftly.
It's raining here.
Let us do our job.
Stir the paint with a stick.
I have something else to show you.
Speak more slowly so that we can understand you.
He's in my class.
Everybody thinks I'm dead.
I miss Boston.
I'll meet with Tom.
How could you do this to us?
It looked like no one could stop President Reagan.
You should turn off your cell phone.
Tom was involved in a street brawl.
Do you have any further questions?
How hot is it where you are?
Why did she do that?
I'll see to it immediately.
A thief broke into the house to steal the money.
I hope you'll come again some day.
Do you know how busy I've been?
It suddenly started raining.
You'll pay for this.
Tom is fair.
Why do I have to give this to you?
That's what I said.
"As soon as I find it, I'll bring it over to your place."
What do you think of that?
I don't trust you anymore.
We're standing.
This is my alarm clock.
Tom asked for my number.
"So far, I've told no one."
"After all, it's reasonable."
This failure is due to your mistake.
I like to play football.
Mary is beautiful and intelligent.
Tom has confidence in Mary.
Tom and his team are ready.
I am no longer able to handle the chest pain.
Did Tom really come back?
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
You never tell me that you love me.
Do you study English?
I kept telling myself that it would all be over soon.
You need to follow the rules.
"When I met Tom, he was dating a girl named Mary."
"Not knowing what to do, we telephoned the police."
It's for you to decide.
They made her go.
Is Tom still a French teacher?
Do you think he is dead?
Are you saying Tom isn't from Boston?
The movie wasn't as interesting as I expected it to be.
I'll take the next bus.
This will help keep you warm.
"I used to do that, but I don't do it anymore."
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
Where were you when I needed your help?
Put your watch ahead. It's slow.
Tom prefers to eat French fries with ketchup.
I have to reply to this letter.
New facts about ancient China have recently come to light.
Does it have a distinguishing mark?
Why do I have to be here?
Tom is wearing the tie I gave him.
People were told to stay indoors because of the violence in the streets.
How do you know where I live?
I don't agree with you.
Don't be insulted.
"I was born on April 3, 1950."
Tom is my rival.
Tom could've died.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
They checked how pure the water was.
She was laughed at by her friends.
We can't release the prisoners today.
Tom doesn't know what to say to make Mary feel better.
"Come on, you two."
"That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?"
"You're not listening, are you?"
Do you want me to paint your fingernails?
We aren't that poor.
Tom will probably be here in the morning.
Was Tom handsome?
I'm always hungry.
Maybe Tom did the right thing for the wrong reason.
Tom's first job was shoveling snow.
I don't know whether I'll be able to attend tomorrow's meeting.
We must change our plan.
"If you are hungry, why don't you eat?"
I've finished all the work for today.
How long have you two been engaged?
I don't know which one to choose.
Japan is weird.
Tom's bored.
Freedom is not free.
It's the only possible explanation.
Go wait outside.
"Clean your room, please."
He is thirsty for fame.
You read too much.
He proved to be honest.
Tom doesn't have a TV at home.
I was just about to leave.
We had fun with them.
I wish you'd never been born.
I guess it depends on the weather.
I came by to feed Tom's fish.
Are you texting Tom?
"You wouldn't want that to happen, would you?"
Ukrainian girls are the most beautiful girls in the world.
Please don't try this at home.
She advised him that he should stay at home.
"All of a sudden, the lights went out."
She made me wait for half an hour.
That's pseudoscience.
"Happiness isn't the destination, happiness is the journey."
You say you want to go to Boston? Why in the world would you want to go there?
Has it occurred to you that Tom might not want to be here?
Everything that Tom said is true.
I must obey Tom.
He was fortunate to pass the exam.
Do I have to go now?
Did you consider other alternatives?
Tom makes Mary happy.
They are willing to talk about the problem.
Tom can run as fast as Mary.
Why didn't you think of that before?
Let's talk about why you're here.
Tom seems to be a friendly person.
He slipped me a note.
I don't feel like cooking today.
It's popular with students.
It is cold today.
What time is your bus?
I like women.
Tom seemed unsure.
My grandfather is living on a pension.
I must find out who did this.
Finish this.
My father will kill me.
It is no use arguing about it.
Tom failed to persuade Mary.
Tom was a mean man before his daughter was born.
People lost faith in banks.
I hope to meet you all again.
I truly loved her.
I went for a walk with my son.
Isn't that what they want?
You should always keep your room clean.

Do you understand the mission?
I don't know how I should do it.
I just wanted to go home.
Look at this picture.
I thought you weren't coming.
Tom keeps a change of clothes in his office.
I'm only pulling your leg.
Tom tried to compose himself.
Tom would've called Mary if he'd had her phone number.
It's quarter to eight now.
I missed my connecting flight.
How is your last name written?
He does not have to do this.
Tom has to go see Mary.
Who's the gorgeous girl I saw wandering around in the mall with you?
Tom got the job on the strength of your recommendation.
At first I tried to write everything down in my notebook.
"Pass me the salt, please."
"You do like us, don't you?"
Tom reads almost no books at all.
Where's Tom today?
I pay most of my bills on the first of each month.
Her name wasn't on the list.
Please reply in Chinese or English.
Tom'll call.
It is said that there will be a big earthquake in the near future.
Go find Tom.
We have two dogs. One is black and the other is white.
Do I have to answer in English?
The radio is too loud. Turn the volume down.
I guess we're even now.
It's misleading.
Mary doesn't use salt in her cooking.
It would be better for you to stay in bed today.
Welcome to the United States.
Tom's very neat.

Tom did an outstanding job.
Make your own decision.
Tom is still very angry.
May I open a can?
You're just like your mother.
Our teacher tried to use a new method of teaching English.
You make me happy.
Is the bar open yet?
He was attacked by a shark.
You mustn't stay out that late.
I'm going to bed.
Let's talk about something else.
Tom ran for mayor.
I'll watch Tom.
I'm sorry I let you down.
Tom may testify.
Would you like to drink anything?
We've talked about this many times before.
Arabic is read from right to left.
Have you been able to contact Tom?
They've taken Tom home.
It is pleasant to sleep under the tree.
"If you want to say something, go ahead and say it."
It's an absolute waste of time to wait any longer.
We are busy preparing for our wedding and honeymoon.
Climate change is not a hoax.
You need to stop pretending that you don't care.
Some people are killing time relaxing on park benches.
I'll sleep on the floor.
I don't think Tom is able to do that anymore.
I love it here.
I know.
I just woke up a few minutes ago.
He was run over and killed.
I think you're going to like this movie.
Stop yelling!
Tom lies.
Have you paid your taxes?
I would like to have some more water.
It looks like Tom likes his new job.
This fruit tastes bad.
We have to do something to stop Tom from hurting himself.
We were totally exhausted from the five-hour trip.
I can't tell them apart.
I doubt Tom will do that.
"He seldom, if ever, goes to the movies."
I have a bad cold.
Your friendship has great value to me.
I broke his heart.
That is all right.
Tom had to wait.
I shoot the rabbits in my garden with a squirt gun to keep them away from the vegetables.
Why aren't they coming?
"As the day got cooler, I had to put on a sweater."
Please stop laughing.
We disturbed him.
I laughed so hard I cried.
He deceived me.
Promise me you won't to do anything stupid.
We'll do fine without you.
"He is getting old, but he is as healthy as ever."
"If you change your mind, let us know."
What have you done with my pen?
The shotgun went off.
The room is empty.
You don't need to go.
I've never seen one before.
It rains a lot in Okinawa.
Please come to pick me up.
It was a new experience for everyone.
Tom was sitting at home in his pajamas watching TV.
Our college uses far too much electricity.
He smells bad.
Tom was there yesterday.
My daughter graduated from the university today.
We all live in the same dormitory.
That wasn't my mistake.
She’s a doctor now.
I have no money with me.
This place is nice and quiet.
She can even play the drums.
Can your wife speak French?
Tom has only fifteen minutes to eat his lunch.
Life isn't fair.
Tom took off his coat and hung it up.
Tom and Mary traveled around Japan.
That dog is so stupid.
I was absent from school because I was sick.
All but Tom were present.
I'll finish it as quickly as I can.
That's the new manager.
Tom was homesick.
Tom turned on the small lamp on his bedside table.
We worry about your future.
It was impressive.
What is the basis for the argument?
Do you know her?
I'll be there right away.
This is the girl that came yesterday.
They arrived at the foot of the mountain.
She turned away from me.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
You seem busy.
The dog seems sick.
Tom should've done it the way you told him to do it.
What do you plan to major in at college?
You have no right to tell me what to do.
What good are they?
"Tom is planning to go tomorrow, isn't he?"
It is hard to distinguish you from your brother.
You're incompetent.
Tom picked up the knife and looked at it closely.
"Did Tom, by any chance, let Mary drive the car?"
Tom said he doesn't think that Mary really wants to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
Democracy is an idea that goes back to the ancient Greeks.
What's your favorite TV series?
Three children sat on the sofa.
I met him by chance.
There's a hole in the bottom of the bucket.
"He has a sister and she goes to school, too."
She has perfected the art of handling difficult customers.
Tom smelled Mary's perfume as soon as he entered the room.
Your story is hard to believe.
"Tom is in the living room, sleeping on the couch."
I'm going to be a teacher.
I didn't mean it.
You're the historian.
I've said too much already.
Tom is beardless.
My brother paid double the price.
Nothing seems to make sense anymore.
This house will rent easily.
Tom sold his company.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I have been to London twice.
I suggest you give your old computer to Tom.
Please send an ambulance.
Tom was sleeping.
He won't beat me.
I set my watch ahead one hour.
I'd like you to look at something.
Did you see it?
"If you ask me, it was just a waste of time."
Did Tom laugh?
Over-sleeping is no excuse for being late.
We spent all evening dancing together.
Why would I fire you?
This isn't my umbrella. It's someone else's.
It was one of the great discoveries in science.
This is old news.
Tom attached a string to the kite.
"Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive."
I waited for her for one hour.
The paint hasn't dried yet.
That's what Tom is known for.
I like Boston.
Why didn't you think of that before?
It's a steal.
Theory and practice should go hand in hand.
What he says is total nonsense.
This is my third time to come here.
How did Tom get to be so rich?
It's my horse.
Tom went outside.
I like coffee hot.
It is foolish of you to say such a thing.
He often eats out on Saturday nights.
They took a big risk.
The rent is due tomorrow.
Tom is a good drummer.
Tom took care of that.
We were bored.
Press any key to continue.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
Tom is getting nervous.
I like many kinds of music.
Maybe we ought to ask Tom for advice.
You can't afford to be late.
Tom was dangerous.
I thought the captain ordered you not to do that.
Is one of you Tom?
Where am I going?
Tom got bored after three minutes.
She's older than him.
I love to take pictures.
You don't have the guts.
We can open the window.
"What day is today? ""It's Monday."""
How often do you go shopping?
That was quick.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
It's the only one in the world.
Try to recall what happened.
Neither Tom nor Mary can play tennis very well.
May I kiss you?
He doesn't like oranges.
The picture looks better at a distance.
I brought you some coffee.
It's been two years since I saw him last.
What good is that?
You had better put on your crash helmet.
Tom fed the dog.
Tom said that he wanted to see the manager.
Tom really needs your help.
Tom denied that.
She soon adjusted herself to village life.
The water is clean.
Tom doesn't have time to talk to you.
I can't do it alone. I need your help.
Tom aimed his pistol at the target.
You look European.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
There's somebody coming up the stairs.
The room was dark and cold.
Can someone explain how this always happens?
All Tom does is watch TV.
"If you don't want to stay, you don't have to."
I don't know who made the cake.
Tom lives with us.
She felt a bit tired.
I know what I'm saying.
Why are you so busy today?
Tom gave me that.
Tom and Mary are still not talking to each other.
Could you please repeat that?
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.

There are a lot of earthquakes in Japan.
My grandfather is 90 years old and very lively.
What'll you do this weekend?
We need to go.
It was decided that the ball game be put off.
Tom told me to speak to you in French.
Tom threw a pillow at me.
You don't have to hurry.
It'll soon be Christmas.

He ordered me to stand up.

I don't want to do that.
The place where he lives is far from town.
He telephoned me again and again.
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
They skinned him alive.
Tom asked the teacher some questions.
There are no spoons.
Gravity acts on everything in the universe.

Let's play volleyball.
Tom is somewhere here on the campus.
"Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the cost."
Tom was a little surprised by Mary's conclusion.
Tell me what to do.
Why don't you give Tom a chance?
He still remembers the day his mother found out he was smoking.
He's everybody's friend.
I will stay home today.
Who's screaming?
"Patting me on the shoulder, he thanked me for helping him."
She's not my type.

Let us go.
Tom threatened Mary.
"If you don't want it, I'll eat it."
I told Tom to do that.
Whether she will agree or not is not clear.
She doesn't remember if his car was yellow or not.
Everyone changes.
You had better tell me now.
Tom wasn't mad.
What can I do to convince you?
Tom was sunbathing by the pool.
Do you go there by bus or by car?
It was hot yesterday.
Are all of them your friends?

I can't put up with his violence any longer.
I want to talk to the doctor.

Tom is really confused.
The demand was summarily rejected.
Land prices seem to just keep going up.
Tom said he wanted to watch a little TV.
I don't know what you want.
Look out!
I wondered why Tom didn't have a girlfriend.

I've never had to do anything like this before.
Tom sharpened the knife.
Why are you so nice to everyone?
"For all her riches, she's not happy."
I see no reason not to.
Tom put his pistol under his pillow.
How old do you think she is?
He didn't want to do it.
"I had some calls to make, too."

There's somebody coming up the stairs.
My nose is itchy.
Jackson is my family name.
Show me your sketches.

When is school over?
My English teacher advised me to read these books.
He hasn't left any message.
I never realized how much I would miss you.
May I ask some questions?
"Tom loves me and I love him, too."
No one believed me at first.
It works well.
He searched all day for the letter.
Call me at the office tomorrow morning.
I overslept.
Don't ask me such difficult questions.
Tom is getting married.
May I speak to you in private?
There's a lot of big game in that forest.

I can't put up with him.
She had left the front door unlocked.

I'm too old for this.
That's news to me.
He gets ahead of everybody in his work.

You're spending too much time on the computer.
How did you do it without our help?

"I hate mosquitoes, but they seem to love me."
We're so glad to have you here.
Tom was willing to try it again.
Do you believe in God?
Put it down.
"If I were you, I would trust her."
I tried again and again.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
I major in economics.
Now would be a good time.
I cannot put up with this noise.
I went there early to get a good seat.
I'm good at Japanese.
We can do it right now.
Take Tom's advice.
Have a beer with me.
Where is my comb?
A dog was running after a cat.
Maybe we're both mistaken.

I know where you are.
What a wonderful morning! I feel on top of the world.
Someone took my stuff.
I gave Tom one of those.
We're going dancing today.

Too late.

The hotel we stayed at last summer is near the lake.
May I use your phone?
Tom didn't know what he was doing.
Could you please say that once again in French?

He is not what he used to be.
Learning a foreign language requires patience.
I've got to get to the bank.
She's been absent from school for five days.
Tom woke up with a terrible headache.

He is managing the business for his father.
I'm not sure that I can swim that far.
I don't want to die alone.

You're contributing.
That would be prudent.

When do you study?
Tom is stronger than you.
You're going to have to leave.

Can I open the window?
He teaches English to his friends.
I had hardly checked in at the hotel when he called me.
Tom is in the garden planting flowers.
"Could you carry this box for me, please?"
Both of them were not present at the meeting.
Did Tom say why he wanted to borrow the truck?

Why is Mary going with him to the picnic?
There are still a lot of things to do.
Can you whistle?

"Tom is lost, but is unwilling to admit it."
Tom looks drowsy.
Statistics indicate that our living standards have risen.
What do they sell?
She brought up the three children alone.
Tom is possessed.
What can I do for you?
Tom is a lazy student.
He contributed to the good of the community.
We almost missed the train.
I don't have a problem.
Tom reminded his mother to wake him up at 6:30.
There is going to be a storm.
You'll do no such thing.
Tom reluctantly agreed.
I showered before breakfast.
This guitar originally belonged to Tom.
I've spoken in French with Tom many times.
"Tom is honest, isn't he?"
We woke up after midnight.
Tom left his work half done so he could get to the station in time.
It's an old stereotype.
The Soviet Union launched Sputnik I in 1957.
Your plan won't work.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
Where did you have your picture taken?
The fog has lifted.
There's something wrong.
She's a sweet girl.
That should please everyone.
I'm getting better every day.
"I warned you not to get near him, didn't I?"
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
I just can't figure it out.
I have an ache in my arm.
None of that means anything to me.
Your bag's open.
Are you Tom's lawyer?
We sat in the front.
"Tom has some food allergies, so he has to be careful about what he eats."
Will you let me try once more?
She ditched me.
Tom ate.
Do you need the keys?
Why do you have to be so dramatic?
I am not a morning person.
Tom served the guests finger food.
She arrived late as usual.
He told me to meet him there.
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
I bit my lip.
Tom has a dentist appointment at 2:30.
"I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it."
You were both drunk.
I'll look into that.
You have everything.
Tom wasn't even hurt.
You're a naive person.
We stayed in Boston for about a week.
Tom wants to talk to you again.
The man attacked her with the intention of killing her.
Describe your ideal breakfast.
It's a pity when somebody dies.
There aren't that many synagogues in this city.
You may do whatever you want to.
He is a medical student.
What's that thing you have in your hand?
It's a fine day.
I want some answers and I want them now.
Tom can't speak French. Mary can't speak French either.
Can I borrow your brush?
My income and expenses aren't balanced.
My dog sleeps under my bed.
I don't think I'll ever sound like a native speaker and I don't really think I need to.
Take a card.
Why did you kiss me?
Did you ever try?
We don't know each other.
I'm sitting alone in my house.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
I don't want to be alone anymore.
It was already twelve when he reached home.
Did we have any English homework that needs to be done by tomorrow?
It's a hot day.
"I'm glad to see you, Tom."
I'd like to play a game of squash.
I want to eat out tonight.
I forgot to pay the electric bill.
I am in trouble.
What are you doing out here?
She unbuttoned her shirt.
"If I'd known what you were going to do, I'd've tried to stop you."
I always thought Tom was a complete idiot.
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
Yesterday I heard you talking in your sleep.
Did you mean it?
What is the student population at your college?
The American Navy was ready to fight.
What do you need the money for?
I'll show you my room.
There are many good restaurants in Boston.
It's almost October.
We aren't like that.
I can find my own way out.
Tom couldn't see Mary.
These kittens are so cute and cuddly.
Tom slept on the couch.
Tom lost his footing and fell into the water.
You had better look up the word.
Tom is in the kitchen helping his mother.
I'm healthy.
Tom is emotional.
Will you let me try once more?
They live in constant fear.
I doubt that he can make a speech in public.
Some people say thirteen is an unlucky number.
Tom entered the house through the window.
My mother made me what I am today.
Tom did a very stupid thing.
I want you to love me for who I am.
This annoys me very much.
Has Tom actually ever done that?
"I want to be your ally, not your enemy."
Mary put her purse on the kitchen table.
She took full advantage of her stay in London to improve her English.
"Which do you like better, apples or bananas?"
That's stupid.
I stood aside to let them pass.
Do you know what has become of him?
Tom drives Mary up the wall.
There is no hope of success.
What is she like?
My best friend died of asphyxiation.
He achieved his goal.
My husband is a doctor.
I'd like to see the menu.
I want to tell you about Tom.
Maybe Tom was just trying to help you.
"Tom isn't here yet, but we expect him soon."
You said it would never happen.
I don't care for the way he talks.
He acted like a saint.
I thought it was really bad.
Tom shifted gears.
They say that he's very rich.
"Pass me the wine, please."
Eternity is a really long time.
I was wrong about you.
You should tell him the truth.
I have to give it to Tom.
It's hard to get good help these days.
What's Tom's problem?
Tom is Mary's chauffeur.
We arrived first.
I see you're doing very well in your business.
Answer Tom.
He had breakfast all alone.
Guns are readily accessible to Americans.
I realize the effort you have put into this project and I really appreciate it.
I wonder if you might be able to help me.
A number of tourists were injured in the accident.
Does your throat hurt?
He drank straight from the bottle.
"Tom has gone to get a haircut, but he should be back soon."
Tom's afraid.
This man is incompetent.
They loved you.
I don't have a single enemy.
Tom stayed in bed all day watching TV.
Why are you still here?
We will respect your wishes.
I thought you said Tom was dangerous.
Tom lives on the third floor.
Tom will provide you with all the information you need.
I don't believe one word of it.
The day turned out to be fine.
She accompanied him on the piano.
Why do you need so many clothes?
Which is the heavier of the two?
Have you ever been to Mexico?
Tom said he'll do that.
I'll live.
Tom lived in that small house for a little over ten years.
You never say anything.
I can't go back to that house.
The dog follows me wherever I go.
I just can't live without you.
She cannot have done such a thing.
The injured man moaned quietly.
Do you know where Tom is now?
Tom and Mary excused themselves and went outside.
You're such a chicken.
Pull the string and the water flushes.
I ate caviar.
What is your blood type?
Tom needs to find an apartment near where he works.
I stumbled across this problem when I was working on something else.
He bowed to the Queen.
I have a right to my own opinion.
I assume the two of you know each other.
Tom and Mary want to talk to you.
Crows are smart.
"Mary isn't just my sister. She's my best friend, too."
Tom loved the book Mary gave him.
Are you back home now?
I met her late in the evening.
I wonder if she'll accept a belated birthday present.
Tom never arrived.
Did you already do your homework?
Please be careful.
I've got a better solution.
My parents are opposed to my sister marrying a foreigner.
I'll take the bus.
Our school's gym is under construction now.
Both of us are from Australia.
I think you did a great job.
Take it easy!
She went out of the room in anger.
He's not ready.
I never actually saw Tom and John fighting.
We both have driver's licenses.
He fired most of his men.
We've been living here since July.
We all want prices to fall.
It's 7:45.
You don't even know Tom.
We're supposed to meet Tom in thirty minutes.
Tom said he didn't mean to hurt you.
An accident may happen at any time.
Tom doesn't get it.
This book has gone through eight editions.
He was brought to tears.
It is impossible.
Tom told Mary that he'd be late.
Tom is my brother.
You should have done it earlier. It cannot be helped now.
Tom's plan didn't sound stupid.
We've been much busier than we expected to be.
Do you want me to go with Tom?
Camels are often used to travel in the desert.
Would you like to get slapped?
It took a lot of time.
They wanted protection.
We postponed the event.
Tom said that he had a bad headache and needed to lie down.
How much did you pay for that?
The bush is burning.
What's this about?
Tom has a silk scarf.
Tom doesn't seem so well.

I want a job.
He knows many amusing magic tricks.
Thank you for building this wall.
I sensed immediately that something was wrong.
Skiing is my favorite sport.
I want that one.
I don't know. What do you think?
You're starting to bother me.
You're a likable person.
Do you understand what you've done?
Do you have an English menu?
Get out of my room.
Tom has trouble keeping up with the rest of the class.
I have to give a class tomorrow at 2:30.
They went on arguing for hours.
I said that quite a long time ago.
I do feel pretty good.
Something changed.

I have Tom's address somewhere.
You don't follow the rules.
Can you print this document for me?
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
"I wanted to tell Tom in person, so I drove over to his house."
I finally found out what had been causing the pain in my leg.
I'd rather do something else.
I believe Tom is innocent.
He's been waiting here for a long time.
"If only she had known I was in Tokyo, she would have come to visit me."
"It's his, isn't it?"
His letter doesn't make any sense.
Tom is falling.
Does the room have a bath?
We had a minor disagreement.
I decided to buy a car.
Tom isn't the kind of person who is intimidated by anyone or anything.
I went to the room.

Our house isn't insulated.
The plants need to be watered.
We never talked about religion.
I haven't heard a word from them in over four years.
When was the last time you washed the car?
Why'd you do that?
I agree with their plan.
He meant no harm.
Why are you so hard-headed?
He tends to take sides with the weaker party.
Making amends is the first step toward rehabilitation.
He could get the information by reading the letter.
Circumstances did not permit me to help you.
Exceptions prove the rule.
Tom had never been late for work before.
Tom wishes to speak with me.
Let's try once again.
Where did you spend your vacation?
I took it.
I had no choice but to agree.
Please don't forget to mail the letters.
"I entered the shop, and a clerk said, ""May I help you?"""
She has no one to speak to.
Tom is looking for a larger apartment.
She is Japanese.
Tom threw his old notebooks away.
She thought for a few minutes.
How long do you intend to spend at the library?
He saved the boy at the risk of his own life.
Tom didn't mean any offense.
She must have done it yesterday.
How about a snack?
I'm going to the hospital.
Tom refuses to buy anything made in China.
Tom made an embarrassing mistake.
I'll be pleased to help you.
It hurt more than I thought it would.
I have no sisters.
Don't give the dog anything to eat.
I can't exclude it.
Do you want Tom?
I don't know why Tom isn't here.
Tom didn't have time to read the report.
The court found him guilty of stealing money.
You should have nothing to do with him.
What does it look like to you?
You are very fortunate that you have such friends.
Tom isn't there.
How about a cup of coffee?
Winning a trophy made Tom happy.
Tom sat in the first row.
It isn't mine.
I want to see Tom.
1980 was the year that I was born.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
I'd do the same for you.
"Eventually, Tom just gave up."
Spain controlled Florida.
That wasn't Tom.
Tom and Mary fight all the time.
He's a strange character.
"You're not very happy, are you?"
He wondered to himself why his wife had left him.
Tom is embarrassed by his son's behavior.
"Tom isn't there, is he?"
Tom wrote down what Mary said.
"My cousin, who is a lawyer, is in France at present."
Tom is small for his age.
I received your letter the day before yesterday.
"Today, I have other plans."
"I don't care, and neither should you."
Tom was in the cabin.
Do you mind if I take my shirt off?
There were many children in the room.
I'm beginning to feel out of place.
You should omit this word from the sentence.
Is there wheelchair access?
You didn't need to come so early.
You'd better get going.
I think we should continue this conversation outside.
Do you feel like talking about it?
Tom discovered two dead bodies in his basement.
Tom often wears sunglasses.
Mary knows that Tom isn't her real father.
Tom advised Mary not to leave her door open.
"Chances are they're lost, and that's why they're late."
I don't really like you.
Tom is learning a new technique.
I live in the house my father built.
She was naive.
Have you been to London?
I like to sleep on my stomach.
Tom is obviously upset.
Let's get a closer look.
Please make yourselves comfortable.
They failed to get the necessary votes.
What is two plus two?
"In 1962, Algeria gained independence from France."
I believe it's a myth.
I like pizza very much.
I have to take off.
I don't want that one.
Rigor mortis sets in soon after death.
The snow lasted four days.
You don't have to be afraid.
Hold the handrail.
I tried really hard to convince Tom to help Mary.
What time will you get to the station?
The cancer needed to be removed immediately.
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
I'll call Tom and see what he's doing.
We need some money.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
I have a few questions.
Tom picked up the pieces of shattered glass.
I bought this racket at a 20 percent discount.
This window has been broken for a month.
Tom has been eating too much pork.
Do you still love me?
What was I thinking?
Are you able to swim?
I'm thirty.
I'll love you until I die.
"Do as I say, and no one will get hurt."
We gave our mother a watch.
It's so sweet.

It looks very expensive.
What is it you'd like me to do?
I'm not able to speak so fast.
She was the first one to notice him.
Tom is going to pick me up after school.
She's not penniless.

We lived on what we could find in the forest.
Who's your favorite painter?
You can't do this to yourself.
I haven't had the honor of meeting him.
I dropped the plate accidentally.
He followed in his father's footsteps.
Have a piece of pie.
Do you want Tom punished for what he did?
He is twice as old as she is.
Can you pronounce these words?
I remember everything you tell me.
These are my friends.
Don't worry about the result of your test.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
You're a coward.
I'll be able to finish in a day or two.
Aren't you hot?
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Our friendship will last a long time.
Tom is almost as tall as you.
Tom seems impatient.
I heard you crying.
Maybe I was wrong.
My sister dropped her plate on the floor.
Did I miss the party?
Where do you usually eat lunch?
Take the first street to the right.
He studied the way birds fly.
His son fell over the cliff.
It's difficult to find work.
He wants to meet you.
Tom will return at 2:30.
"Owing to the storm, the ship could not leave port."
I've never heard of such a strange story.
Would you like some more orange juice?
She is always smiling.
I think I still have time for another cup of coffee.
Tom and Mary dipped into their savings to buy a house.
Tom told Mary the truth.
I speak French to my staff.
I haven't been out for ages.
I got a lot to say.
The television doesn't work.
That is something you should not have said.
It's about time for him to get here.
Tom said that he was thirsty.
I have been busy since last Sunday.
Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa very close to each other.
I'm being blackmailed.
Are you a good dancer?
Tom relented.
I'm looking for someone.
How did you figure that out?
The dress suits you very well.
Tom said that he wasn't a Christian.
I'll begin by asking a question.
She explained the rules in detail.
The pain has gone.
How could that have happened?
The forest was so thick that one could hardly walk through it.
Tom finished eating then washed the dishes.
What's Tom doing in Boston?
Why is Tom still standing outside in the rain?
Mary took a little mirror out of her purse and checked her hair and make-up.
Give me the book.
Do you have any questions?
He would like to know whether you play chess.
What are you doing tomorrow?
He and I are teachers.
Tom thinks he's invincible.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
I'll treat you to sushi.
Who were you going to sell it to?
We sent you an email with an activation link.
There is no place like home.
Has Tom spoken to you about me?
Write your answer with a pen.
That was the worst movie I've ever seen.
I hear his business is on the verge of ruin.
Tom and Mary were dancing to the music.
Our meeting room has no windows.
You're not alone.
I wish I'd never sung that song.
You have to go to the party.
I'm surprised Tom isn't with Mary now.
You don't need to go at once.
I've done what you wanted.
This is the hottest summer we have had in fifty years.
You're worried.
Tom took off his glasses and wiped his eyes.
I'm used to it by now.
I burped loudly.
Do you have snow tires for your car?
I'm gonna have to call you back.
The road is muddy.
I'm feeling kind of tired.
Alexander was a great conqueror.
"If he calls, tell him I am busy."
There's too much sugar in the coffee.
Did you draw this?
He lost his way in the woods.
She barely ate her lunch.
I don't know if it's true or not.
What is that huge building?
No one seems to have the guts to do that anymore.
I'm sure Tom will like the gift you got him.
Would you like for me to make you something to eat?
This vending machine won't accept 500 yen coins.
I want to have a talk with him.
What am I looking at?
Nothing great has been achieved by playing it safe.
The door was half open.
Tom doesn't know where Mary has gone.
"Needless to say, health is more important than wealth."
They have treated her well.
I don't think that he's honest.
"You're a prince, Tom."
I think Tom is expecting us both.
Are you up?
I don't know them at all.
The days are getting longer and longer.
It depends on the size of the chair.
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her.
"Is it OK to eat this mushroom? ""It's OK to eat anything once."""
You don't have to say that.
These chairs are by no means satisfactory.
I waited for ten minutes.
It looks like you've put on a little weight.
What's your favorite color for shoes?
Tom likes to play soccer.
I'd like to shake Tom's hand.
Tom was in Boston last weekend.
A man's got to do what a man's got to do.
I'm not accustomed to getting up early.
Promise me you won't do that again.
She likes sleeping.
It's hard to imagine.
What is your new friend's name?
I hope we didn't keep you waiting.
One drop of the poison is enough to kill 160 people.
The old barn collapsed.
I never see you without thinking of my father.
He treats me like a child.
Tom is right.
"Tom opened the envelope, pulled out the letter and unfolded it."
The house caught fire.
Would you mind lending me your pen?
He wrote a book on China.
"Copy this, please."
"Were I you, I would not do such a rude thing."
I didn't mean to offend you.
Lesson Two is easy.
I was a prison warden for ten years.
It's made of brass.
I feel worse today than I did yesterday.
Is this correct?
Tom's doing OK.
My sister is playing with dolls.
Tom convinced me to stay.
"You don't know how to speak French very well, do you?"
I can't stand this pain.
Just keep moving.
After lunch we have two more classes.
Don't think I didn't try.
I never had the chance to talk with Tom.
A lion's teeth are sharp.
The two families have very close ties.
My sister likes painting.
Would it bother you if I smoke?
Modern ships only need a small crew.
Tom is a very poor driver.
Taxi fares will go up next month.
Tom drew a circle in the sand with a stick.
Thanks for your explanation.
I'm calling from Boston.
The problem is that I don't have enough money.
How long have you known him?
Iceland was fantastic.
Only four horses were in the race.
Let me fix the switch.
She was naive.
I'm glad to hear you're better.
You shouldn't associate with men like that.
Does the bus stop here?
Why are we moving?
I don't know who it is.
You do good work.
He lost his life in an accident.
Look at what you've become.
What's he talking about?
"If you allow me to speak, I'll be able to explain everything."
You'll be sorry!
I used to keep a diary when I was at high school.
My mother tasted the milk.
The airplane ascended into the clouds.
Did you see the accident with your own eyes?
Did you believe Tom?
Tom behaved well.
I'm crazy about you.
I'll never go out with Tom again.
Tom made it easy for me.
Men are simple.
Tom may have some good ideas.
Maybe I threw it away.
You can sit next to me.
I've been watching Tom.
Have you ever been to the United States?
I'll make it up to you.
My major is linguistics.
Don't forget your stuff.
I'm sorry.
They have already begun.
It's cold out there.
It hasn't changed one iota.
Tom has started looking for a job.
Are you taking your meds?
Tom is accustomed to hard work.
I never thought it could happen to me.
Tom closed his eyes during the scary parts of the movie.
Everyone does it.
Tom is dusting.
Tom said Mary was very tired.
I can't help you if I don't know where you are.
I don't want to torment you any longer.
Stop here.
I like the atmosphere of this restaurant.
Do you have any good news?
He spent much of his time reading.
Tom won the race.
We had fun shopping.
I think it's around here.
I talk in my sleep very often.
Tom couldn't protect me.
I prefer coke to coffee.
Tom asked Mary who had been the first to arrive.
Tom changed.
I know exactly where you are.
I know that most people here hate me.
I have what I want.
Tom is housesitting.
Did you see my father?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
Where's my horse?
It is the things that we do not possess which seem to us most desirable.
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you.
Why should you want to do that?
I need a new car.
That's your funeral.
He is something like his father.
I am always at home on Sundays.
I had to decline the invitation because I was ill.
She invited her friends to dinner.
They're cousins.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Tom pulled an MP3 player out of his bag.
Tom sat down on an empty chair.
I don't think I've heard that word in a long time.
Tom looks as young as ever.
Tom has an appointment with Mary at 2:30.
Her son is sure to succeed.
That fact can't be denied.
Tom pulled the nail out of the board with a crowbar.
You put in too much pepper.
Tom needs to do that as soon as possible.
I came to wish you good luck.
I can't get any work done here with all these children in the room.
Tom died at the age of 97.
Tom is necessary.
How long will you be staying with us?
Don't ask so many questions.
We study many subjects in high school.
"Before I could protest, I was handcuffed and was on my way to prison."
You have my blessing.
I'm nothing without you.
Tom is taking a big chance.
Did you speak with Tom?
Would you mind telling me what you're waiting for?
I'm waiting for someone.
She was hit by a car while she was crossing the street.
Tom tried to help Mary up the steps.
That's not true either.
He's in a bad mood.
I like to eat sweets.
Look what we've found.
Did Tom look busy?
I couldn't see Tom's face.
Tom was unharmed.
He had the appearance of being half-starved.
Do you think you're up to it?
See you then.
It's completely natural.
We did everything we could to save the boy.
I did nothing unlawful.
He hung up his coat.
I won't bore you with the details.
I'd like to know more about what happened to Tom.
"Hey, what're you doing tomorrow night?"
I knew I should've married you.
He pretends to be deaf.
I understand that you're a good friend of Tom's.
Tom and Mary got married in secret.
Don't you know what it is?
Tom applauded.
We both know what'll happen if you do that.
Tom trusted him.
I can explain it.
Stop them.
Where is your friend?
It's about time to start.
How do you think it'll go?
"Which is easier, this book or that book?"
He deserves the prize.
We've only been married for three years.
"How are you doing, Tom?"
How about making us some sandwiches?
It was a little fun.
"Come, sit by me."
Tom is trying to earn enough money to buy a new trumpet.
"The more books you read, the more you'll know."
My wife made me a delicious apple cake.
Tom didn't seem too happy to see me.
Tom went to school with Mary.
Maybe Tom gave it to Mary.
This watch costs ten dollars at the most.
How is the family doing?
It wasn't Tom who left the water running.
You're smarter than Tom is.
The man spoke in a low voice.
Tom beat Mary up.
I think this book is worth reading.
Let's eat sushi.
I'm waiting for Tom to return.
He was happily married.
Tom can speak French and English.
I've got one like that already.
What would you do if you had great wealth?
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
My mother is a very good cook.
How is your first name pronounced?
We're dieting.
Tom can cook.
The handling of dynamite is dangerous.
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.
Tom stood up and then everybody else stood up as well.
They studied the map to find a short cut.
You should be careful not to become overconfident.
We talked with the owner of the house.
She was raised by her grandmother.
Did you sleep OK?
Tom is in excellent health.
That's just the beginning.
"You go ahead, Tom. I'll catch up soon."
Please let me do it.
Tom is committed.
Tom wrote a letter to Santa.
Tom is upset right now.
It's not time to go home yet.
"Come on, Tom."
I have been silent for a long time.
Tom doesn't use Facebook.
Where are the lifeboats?
"It's raining, but she's not wearing a coat."
It's been raining since last night.
"Where do you go more often, Boston or Chicago?"
How are you not seeing that?
Tom was twelve when the Berlin Wall fell.
There are many politicians who don't keep their promises.
Did you and Tom have an argument?
Tom is making breakfast.
Do you want to read?
Hundreds of trees in this park blew over in the hurricane.
"Where is my phone? ""It's on my desk."""
Tom wasted no time.
Every website has a unique address.
I'm beginning to regret it.
I like this love song.
Can you help us?
Tom didn't mention why he couldn't come.
I have no idea why it is so.
Don't make Tom do that.
Why can't he play tennis today?
Tom knows some French.
I figured you should know.
Tom sat on the porch having a coffee and a cigarette and watched the world go by.
We might not be so lucky next time.
Give me the money in fives and tens.
I'm grateful to be alive.
Why is taking pictures of trains interesting?
You have done a very good job.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Is this enough money?
He took many pictures in London.
I should have taken the money.
Tom has been kicked out of school.
I love being at Harvard.
Tom already knows.
Do your children know French?
How much did you pay for that?
This book has many pictures.
No one believed me.
He shook hands with the mayor.
Tom ate macaroni and cheese.
Tom is narrow-minded.
Don't make such a racket!
I know how much you love Tom.
"The other day, I met him in Kyoto."
When did you get home?
The yen is expected to lose value against the dollar.
Tom hates it when people keep him waiting.
You might not want to go there by yourself.
You should've been here.
You have my word.
Who did it?
Tom may have seen it.
Nobody tried to help Tom.
Do you think it likely?
Do you think I'm attractive?
I study about two hours every day.
This animal is very clever.
She asked me to stay till her mother came home.
The oven is hot.
I'll get the book.
Have you ever had your fortune told?
The doctor wants Tom to slim down a little.
Bulgarian is like Russian.
I surrender.
I can't believe Tom told you.
I'll graduate this year.
I want him to play the guitar.
The thermostat is defective.
You're very good at what you do.
The car didn't move.
Tom's got a tremendous amount of work to do.
Tom went in Mary's place.
He's very interested in Japanese.
Just brush your hair.
They are facing financial problems.
I don't think there is a doctor here.
I remember a time when we could tell each other anything.
Tom comes here almost every weekend.
Please stop talking.
Will you go to Tokyo by bus?
I'm one of you.
Don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
Tom thinks about Mary all the time.
He has a lunch.
Tom has a fake ID.
The cat climbed up the tree.
Do you have any vacancies?
I get the feeling you don't really want me to win.
You have a very logical way of thinking.
Please put those chairs away.
"I worked hard all day, so I was very tired."
Where's the newspaper?
They did not know what to do first.
How was your walk?
I can't stand this pain any more.
Why don't you ask Tom to do that?
Tom just wants a muffin and a cup of coffee.
"I bought this camera for 25,000 yen."
We saved the best for last.
Tom's virtually admitted that it was his fault.
This is how I learned English.
Fry me an egg.
Are you intentionally trying to confuse me?
"Mary has no musical skill, but she loves to sing."
Tom thought the used car salesman was trying to rip him off.
Why did you wake me up?
My cold is getting worse.
He runs.
I still have a lot of questions I want to ask you about your relationship with Tom.
I told you he was a coward.
The Grand Canyon is one of the most popular places in the USA.
It takes two to tango.
I came at about six.
"Oh, no! My passport is gone!"
He likes listening to the radio.
Tom lives with his parents.
We love you all.
This matter is of great importance.
O positive is the most common blood type.
How did you get here?
I am so busy that I can't help you.
Tom was the only applicant for the job.
It's gone out of style.
I don't want to live forever.
Tom put the key into his pocket.
Tom cried all night.
I don't like to swim in the pool.
"That came in very handy, didn't it?"
Did anybody see you?
He talks as if he were rich.
I don't know any more than you do.
He is better than me at math.
It was too late.
Tom's French has improved.
He teaches mathematics as well as English.
He said there was no life on Mars.
I will be back in less than five minutes.
I felt relieved when my plane landed safely.
"In comparison with Tokyo, London is small."
"Tom isn't at home, but Mary is."
Tom could hardly wait to start his new job.
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
Does it snow in Boston?
Tom has to share a room with his brother.
I agree with what you've written.
Power brings corruption.
How would you like your eggs?
Everyone was looking at me.
Can I have a bite?
It's up to you.
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.
You should've made better use of your time.
Tom put the guitar case down so he could hug Mary.
I don't want to live with that.
Tom appealed to the judge for mercy.
The detective disguised himself as an old gentleman.
He ran faster than his brother did.
Are you through with your breakfast?
Who killed Tom?
I'm a grandfather.
My mother's always yelling at me.
I can't necessarily agree with you on that point.
He just left.
Did you drop it?
You might as well wait until Tuesday.
Do you recycle?
I can do without it.
It took us three hours to come to a conclusion.
He is good at singing.
I thought you were only angry with me and not with the rest of my family.
The work must be finished before noon.
Let's not forget we never could have done this without Tom's help.
Tom walked out.
I'm still not understanding anything.
I am in the house.
Tom said Mary seemed reluctant to eat what he had cooked for her.
Tom is not interested in politics.
Which is our car?
His hands were deep in his pockets.
He is good at diving.
I'll go provided you go with me.
The table was covered with dust.
The prince was lost in the woods.
Are you good at sight reading music?
Riding a horse is a lot of fun.
Tom got out of the bathtub and dried himself off.
How long was Tom in the water?
Tom is remodeling.
I'm your roommate.
"This was your big chance, Tom, and you blew it."
I'm feeling fit.
Please sign your name on the contract.
Tom told me that I shouldn't be doing this.
Is Tom still up?
Tom realized that he had made a mistake.
I'd like a car like yours.
The question is how much.
How did you know my name?
Who ate?
I think I've fallen in love with you.
That would be logical.
It's about three inches in diameter.
I have my own room.
It's very hot in here.
Perhaps you'd be willing to volunteer.
This house was on the market for three years before it sold.
Could I possibly talk to you for a moment?
She is like a mother to me.
Tom left the water running.
You're a good liar.
He was surprised to learn this.
We kept the children quiet.
I know who lives in that house.
I noticed that he had stopped.
He has never hurt anyone.
The residents made complaints about the noise.
Which parent does the child resemble?
Please move the TV set to the left.
I'm not to blame.
I really couldn't have done this without you.
This is the house I live in.
His failure has nothing to do with me.
Stay away from that place.
He stole the money.
I made a fool of myself.
Many people like to travel.
I can't find any garbage bags.
He doesn't obey his parents.
She has a very quick mind.
Tom says that he wants to settle down.
My younger brother watches TV.
Do you remember what I taught you?
The war lasted nearly ten years.
Tom can hardly fit into the jeans he bought last year.
He likes tigers.
I prefer fish to meat.
What advice did Tom give you?
What's your friend's name?
What's your favorite color for carpets?
Tom went fly fishing with his father.
There was a light burning in the window.
He got very drunk.
England is going to win the race.
I thought you loved Tom.
This story is true.
Don't be too long.
Does he play the piano?
Mary has the most clothes of all her friends.
We're expecting Tom to be here soon.
I'm getting hungry.
Don't touch the wet paint.
Tom said he was too drunk to help me do that.
I was very rich until I met her.
It was in London that I last saw her.
I'll talk to you later.
I should've been more thorough.
I think you should do it.
Tom went out of his way to make sure Mary had a good time.
I think Tom might know something.
Tom said that he was aching all over.
Is Tom's illness serious?
You're very arrogant.
How long has it been since we last met?
Do you think it was an accident?
The way you talk is going to get you in trouble someday.
Two women are singing.
It took me nearly two hours to write the essay.
Can you program in C?
I understand what you're going through.
Tom didn't sleep at all last night.
I had a horrible dream last night.
People don't know how to drive in this town.
Tom never would've asked. He'd just have done it without permission.
Tom stared at Mary for a moment.
This is just the type of car I want.
We're playing tag. Do you want to play with us?
Please explain this sentence to me.
Tom almost cracked my ribs when he hugged me.
Can you recommend any other hotels?
I don't like cats.
Why don't you come in?
How does this disease spread?
Tom overheard us.
You've grown up.
How is it at school?
I'm broke.
"I wouldn't say we've achieved our goal yet, but we're within striking distance."
Don't tell her about it.
Tom hardly ever does that anymore.
These two years were completely pointless. It seems to me that I haven't matured one bit since I've been at the university.
It's here.
I had a hard time trying to persuade him to cancel the trip.
Let in some fresh air.
Tom is not as old as you.
My friend is a talkative person.
Tom and Mary are still in their offices. Both of them plan to work late today.
Tom hates rules.
I usually wake up at six.
No taxi stopped.
How do you want to handle this situation?
"If only I'd listened to what Tom said, I wouldn't be in this kind of trouble."
We waited for hours and hours.
I don't have to say anything to Tom.
She made friends with them at the school festival.
I want to ask you some questions about Tom.
I have a feeling I've met her somewhere before.
Do you know what you need to bring?
Would you please write your name here?
She was sitting under a tree.
Birds evolved from dinosaurs.
I'm not sure what else I can do for you.
Do it for me.
I don't think I'll go to Boston.
You should keep your promise.
Do you want to hear the truth?
Tom and Mary took a stroll together.
Can I park my car here?
He avenged his father.
"I don't mind the cold, but I can't stand the heat."
Tom's planning something special for Mary's birthday.
Tom asked me where I bought my belt.
Tom staggered in.
Tom went off on a tangent.
Tom likes traveling.
Look at the man crossing the street.
It's worth a fortune.
He gave each of them a pencil.
Let me have a try at it.
I caught more fish than Tom did.
I cannot help you.
He became blind because of the accident.
Let's check the map.
I can't wear this old suit to that party.
"Tom always wanted to be a doctor, but his grades at school weren't quite good enough to get him into medical school."
Please don't hurt Tom.
You should buy her a gift card instead.
It'll be difficult to convince Tom to help us clean the garage.
Some kids are playing in the park.
You are the best.
Shouldn't we be doing something to help Tom?
I assume this is what you're looking for.
A friend of mine is looking for someone who can speak French.
We don't have a swimming pool.
I'll get what I came for.
France and Britain joined the invasion.
You should have come earlier.
Tom stuck his grocery list to the fridge door with a magnet.
"If the universe is full of stars, why doesn't their light continually light up the entire sky?"
Why do you want to do this?
We're getting there.
This pigeon flew from San Francisco to New York.
The wedding is in two weeks.
I have a big favor to ask.
Why did you sign the confession?
He will be back tomorrow.
You're better than me.
Just let me go.
I was very glad to hear the news.
Many things frighten people these days.
"Are you still mad at me? ""No, not at all."""
Tom's house is on fire.
We bought the goods at $3 a dozen.
Look at these.
The typhoon caused the river to flood.
"If I were you, I'd start immediately."
Tom wanted to be a teacher.
Tom is a family man.
We captured the thief.
"Though he is rich, he is not happy."
You must be crazy.
It hasn't been that long.
They all got into the taxi at once.
What he said was over my head.
Tom walked into Mary's room.
Tom and Mary were trapped in the elevator for three hours.
I'm looking forward to seeing him.
How often do I have to tell you?
She has lived alone for ages.
He made her cry.
When is the next bus to Park Street?
Tom was extraordinarily handsome.
Babies don't stay babies forever.
I am counting on your help.
Be careful where you step.
The police don't have a suspect.
Which search engine do you use?
You can sleep on the couch.
We got into a car.
"When a good opportunity presents itself, I don't let it pass."
I took it for granted.
School starts in September in Europe.
She wasn't able to meet him.
I can do this all night.
The trip will take about five hours.
How can this be done?
The moon moves around the earth.
I saw her yesterday.
Put that book aside for me.
I guess that you can't do it.
I just did what you told me to do.
I'm almost certain it was Tom who stole my wallet.
Tom has been singing a lot of sad songs recently.
You deserve to know the truth.
"Is that you, Tom?"
The situation is getting worse and worse day by day.
God created the world.
You don't have to lie.
"If you know the answer to this question, please tell me."
Tom could tell that Mary was bored.
I've seen Tom on TV many times.
You were late for work.
I think I know why you're here.
What area of China do you like the best?
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
"While he was lost in thought, he heard his name called."
He grew up in a small town.
Tom is a good-looking guy.
Tom didn't take much persuading.
Tom began to suspect that Mary was cheating on him.
I'll go look for Tom.
Tom has no principles.
He studies contemporary literature.
This dictionary isn't any good.
You cannot have your way in everything.
I voted for you.
This room is just about big enough.
Tom is the one we want.
This is how I solved the problem.
I think it's time for me to apologize to her.
"Since I have no children, I have more time to spend doing volunteer work than parents do."
The traffic wasn't moving between Exits 22 and 23.
Tom said he'd like to have another cup of coffee.
Do you have this in another color?
Didn't he tell you who he was?
I disagree with you on the matter.
Tom took Mary to the hospital.
When did you get a motorcycle?
Tom doesn't know what to do first.
She lay on the bed with her eyes open.
"You told Tom to say that, didn't you?"
Listening to a language being spoken is very different from reading or writing the same language.
Tom lied to his wife.
Tom wasn't ready to die.
Tom can change.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I just took a shower.
You've got to help us.
He came across this old coin in an antique shop.
Americans who are over sixty-five make up 12.5% of the total population.
He gets along very well with his friends.
What else would you like to know?
Don't you have something to say to Tom?
Tom's ugly.
"Oh, I just remembered. Tom left you a message."
Don't take my word for it.
When did you get to Kyoto?
This is a souvenir from Hokkaido.
You can go home if you like.
Tom wasn't afraid.
I made no promises.
Everybody seems to like it.
I made a rookie mistake.
I'm happy just to be near you.
"Tom bought an expensive toy for his young son, who then proceeded to spend hours playing with the box it came in."
I don't know either of them.
Tom is a psycho.
Tom said that he didn't have much money on him.
I had a healthy breakfast.
These paintings are beautiful.
I have no reason to lie to you.
The children rarely go outside.
They'll be afraid.
Tom filled the pot with water.
We want you to sing the song.
Tom always peels apples before he eats them.
I can't remember the meaning of the word that I looked up yesterday.
The summer is over.
I haven't seen him since that time.
It may not be a good idea to eat while you are running.
I need some time to think.
You're very good.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
Don't tell me you're jealous.
She picked up a coin.
What have you been doing?
I'm of the opinion that he should apologize to his teacher.
Tom is adorable.
The soldier gave water to me.
Tom handed his cellphone to Mary.
Don't tell a soul.
Can I get you a beer or something?
Tom should be there by 2:30.
Our plans are taking shape.
I absolutely agree with you.
Tom was looking for you.
I really enjoyed that.
The honeymoon is over.
What is it you'd like me to do?
Am I mistaken?
Don't you see the connection?
She saw him eating a sandwich.
This is something to consider.
She patted her son on the shoulder.
Isn't it your day off?
Let's improvise.
He was unconscious for several days.
Do you want to see something cool?
I prefer reading books to watching television.
My computer crashed.
Mary reached into her bag.
I think you're sitting in my seat.
Mary's husband is rich.
There used to be a store right here.
She worked hard.
There's not much difference between the two.
Can you remember the first time we met each other?
There is no situation that is without hope.
It sounded too farfetched.
Are you one of Tom's children?
Let's wait until it stops raining.
Tom and Mary boarded the ship.
I borrowed this comic from his sister.
Do you want to know why Tom isn't here today?
I thought you were happy here.
Tom couldn't completely rule out the possibility that he might be laid off from work.
Would you have done that the same way Tom did?
"If it rains tomorrow, I'm not going to the meeting."
"We ate sandwiches, cakes, and so on."
"She intended to go shopping with her mother, but her mother was busy."
We had lunch at a roadside restaurant.
I supported him.
Where do we go after this?
We must balance our budget.
I'll deal with this problem as soon as I can.
You must help set the table.
I need to know before 2:30.
She's a smart girl.
He is a kind person.
It was a dark night.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Tom knew Mary was up to something.
I don't remember her name anymore.
He waited for several seconds and opened the door.
She has a fair complexion.
You look depressed. Did something happen?
I don't like being a secretary.
Don't you have anything smaller than that?
"Get some sleep, okay?"
Do you want your coat back?
I think Tom is smarter than Mary is.
Japan today is not what it was even ten years ago.
Nobody is too old to learn.
I've never heard him speak ill of others.
Tom gave me his word.
Tom was here.
I'm calling because my credit card has been stolen.
My sister will prepare breakfast.
Tom ordered a bottle of wine.
I don't know that.
I want to hear Tom's voice.
When did you go to bed last night?
I'll find out who he is.
I will stop him from going.
I'll think about it.
Would you like a glass of orange juice with your breakfast?
Don't you sleep well at night?
Your question is illogical.
Who is that man?
I thought everyone knew that.
Why aren't you listening to me?
I never break a promise.
Someone famous said that imagination is more important than intelligence.
It took my eyes a moment to adjust to the darkness.
What has brought you here?
Tom has many things he has to do today.
I'd like you to come at nine.
I'm Tom's older brother.
When did you go there?
I think it's time for me to wash this shirt.
Tom has been looking all over for you.
Tom is doing everything he can to help.
Did Tom hurt you?
Tom doesn't know what he wants.
She's worrying about her exams.
Silicon is a semiconductor.
This movie was very interesting.
"Everywhere he went, he taught love, patience, and most of all, non-violence."
Tom speaks French as well as I do.
I knew the risks.
"I have good news for you, Tom."
This suitcase is too heavy for you.
We took advantage of the good weather to play tennis.
"If there's anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to let me know."
I'd like to know for sure.
Tom doesn't feel like eating.
How many boys are there in this class?
How long has this been going on?
Tom said he is glad that you're back.
He was successful in several areas.
What color is Tom's hair?
She slapped him.
Tom eventually signed the document.
We'll miss you when you're gone.
Keep your voice down.
Everyone seems to be busy but me.
I'll get home on Monday.
Do they both understand French?
Tom's life is in danger.
She thought that he was wasting electricity.
They understand us.
This town hasn't changed a bit since the 1970's.
It's slightly windy.
I'm very glad to be here.
That's not even funny.
We'd like you to come with us.
Tom wants to see that.
I didn't want to spend any more time trying to convince Tom to study French.
Tom and Mary recognized each other.
I've been looking for you all day.
I don't want to come back here ever again.
The parking lot in front of the bank was completely full.
Their relationship isn't equal.
Tom isn't in.
Tom looks stern.
He is the greatest poet that ever lived.
Why do you keep calling me Tom?
"No matter what happens, don't open the door."
"The water temperature's still low so you're not going to swim, are you?"
Do you annoy your brothers?
How did this all start?
There are still people who are illiterate.
Tom says he feels a little better.
A boy your age ought to behave well.
He can't resist sweets.
Tom slit Mary's throat.
It began to snow.
This is your bedroom.
The word processor on the desk is my father's.
That was a terrible thing you said to Tom.
Is that a bottle opener?
Something is wrong with my computer.
Tom and I want to get married.
"I don't speak French, but I can understand it a bit."
Tom is sure to accomplish whatever he sets out to do.
I am hoping to put an end to our unhappy relationship.
I think I know what to say.
I helped.
I think we have enough money.
Tom's hands were tied behind his back.
I wish Tom was here.
I don't want to go bald.
Tom never would've said that.
We can't risk that happening to Tom.
He could speak French.
Tom burned the pancakes.
That was different.
It's been tried.
How do you feel about that?
Times have changed.
Tom isn't happy.
I think you should apologize to Tom.
We find Tom's work satisfactory.
Tom borrowed a large amount of money from Mary.
Tom bought Mary a purse for her birthday.
Tom certainly didn't expect to win.
Tom and his friends played basketball last weekend.
It'll be easier to do that than you think.
I think Tom is asleep.
Tom is rarely late.
When did you realize Tom didn't like it here?
Tom told me that he spoke French.
There's not enough water.
Tom picked up the newspaper and read the headlines.
Tom has said some very good things about you.
The good news spread through the village quickly.
Are we broke?
You may invite whoever wants to come.
I want you to be happy.
Tom is thinking.
I called Tom the following morning.
He accepted his appointment as chairman.
Make him work for it.
I could be in my office all day.
Tom met Mary outside.
"Asked if he was happy, Tom said that he was."
I miss my mother very much.
Tom is the happiest person in the world right now.
You are better than me.
Rules apply to everyone.
Why do you want to do that?
She is old enough to know better.
Tom became a police officer.
Tom disappeared.
Tom looked fatigued.
We must obey.
Tom likes French and he's good at it.
Don't do it!
What did you make?
It can't be removed. It's fixed.
I want to do something with my life.
You are twice as strong as I am.
Writers often refer to a dictionary.
Tom has no siblings.
We must help those who can't help themselves.
Won't you stay for tea?
She lives with him.
They refused to join the army.
I know Tom better than anyone else does.
"My car is very old, but it still runs fairly well."
I was scared stiff.
I brought you some ice.

You're mine.
Stop criticizing me!
Would you like some coffee?
Nobody walks in LA.
She was standing on a ladder painting the ceiling.
Tom is the same age as I am.
I think Tom might've taken something he shouldn't have.
"I lent him some money, but he hasn't returned it yet."
I've never been this happy before.
I just thought I'd call and check.
She pointed at him.
How many suicides do you think there are every year in Japan?
Tom gets indigestion and heartburn when he eats too much rich food.
"Since then, his faith has been severely shaken."
Don't blame the mistake on her.
Every member of the cabinet was present.
Tom bailed Mary out of jail.
There's a safe somewhere in Tom's house.
We laughed and laughed.
Why don't you want me to tell anybody?
I'm here to teach you some manners.
Everybody was so excited.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Give me just a little.
I'd like you to attend the meeting tomorrow.
She seems excited.
They're after me.
"No matter how close we may be, I can not ask him to do that."
She is giving the baby a bath.
There will be a total solar eclipse tomorrow.
You are to stay here until we come back.
I found a rare stamp at that store.
Just put it back on the desk.
Traveling abroad is out of the question.

There were a fair number of people in the hall.

Tom is an excellent skier.
Was that a yes or a no?
The teacher said that the earth is round.
What are they asking for?
He never laughs.
I'm in the attic.
How many books are in your library?
You're not the only one who doesn't believe Tom.
I don't want someone else. I want you.
How much did you pay for the dress?
I get on with him well.
This first question is for you.
I traveled by myself.
It's basically the same thing.
There were a lot of annoying insects flying around.
You'll understand why one of these days.
I was wrong about you.
Here is your key.
Did you know this?
What do you like to eat?
Tom is Mary's grandson.
It's an honor to meet you.
You used to like me.
"I'm to blame, not you."
What's your relationship with Tom?
Is Paris far away?
Did she sleep well?
I wish I was young again.
Nothing is more important in life than health.
I never heard him sing.
Do you want me to help you?
Can you tell us a bit more about that?
"You don't speak French by any chance, do you?"
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
Keep your head down.
A real friend would tell us the truth.
Tom isn't stronger than me.
Be sure to get this finished by the time I come back.
Tom is holding it.
What's wrong with this plan?
I'm very grateful for your help.
She was aching all over.
I admire his skill at driving.
He began singing.
I think Tom might like that.
We're all a team now.
They're having problems with their budget.
We've got a lot to talk about.
I'm speaking from experience.

She has a daughter whose name is Mary.
This book will be printed next year.

Tom is a good singer.
Tom isn't thin.

Would you like to go abroad?
Tom has no authority.
That's what I just said.
Tom seems calm.
You can't just leave me here.
When was the last time you sharpened this knife?
Tom is terrific.
I'm often here.
Follow your desire.
Are Tom and Mary really engaged?
Tom looks a little nervous.
The kitchen was clean.
Tom always keeps Mary's picture in his wallet.
Let's begin.
That is my overcoat.
He would be the last man to break his word.
Speaking English is useful.
We forgive him.
I'll deal with you when I'm done with Tom.
Tell me everything you know.
You must take care of the dog.
It was dark when I reached the hotel.
Tom would never do that.

You're absolutely wrong.
The mother of that child is an announcer.
You never call me.
I don't want Tom to move to Australia.
Fill out the questionnaire.
Tom didn't want to hurt Mary.
Don't go back to sleep!
She's a complete stranger to me.
It doesn't matter to me whether or not I make money doing this.
He told me that he would see it once more.
You may still do it if you want to.
She must have been rich in those days.
I usually agree with her.
Can I borrow your car?
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
Tom left this morning without finishing his breakfast.
The captain gave the order.
I don't snore.
I'm going home.
I like living in Boston.
It only happened once.
Tom opened his eyes.
You will do exactly as I say.
I wish I'd known.
"Tom won $10,000 in the lottery."
Tom said nothing at all.
He is fond of swimming.
Tom saw Mary sitting by herself on the bench next to the pond.

What are they made of?
We may as well begin without him.
Tom can't get Mary to stop.
This is a wooden comb.
I'm impressed by how well you speak French.
Tell her that I am writing a letter.
I suggest we agree to Tom's demands.
I have a friend whose father is a teacher.

I'm sorry for shouting at you.
Give it back.
Do you want another one of these?
He's from Georgia.
Do you know what's become of Tom?
Not all baby animals are cute.
I don't have to listen to you.

What are we going to do about it?
The black dog ran.
He came to Tokyo in search of employment.
"This is my first time, so I'm a little nervous."
Nutrition is inadequate in some poor areas.

Have you finished yet?
"You know that's wrong, right?"
This is how the accident happened.
The president remained in bed.
Tom pretended to be a homeless person.
I can't stand him.

I'm working in Tokyo now.
These pencils are the same color.
I have not yet collected sufficient materials to write a book.
Point to the one you mean.
This is it.

Why do you love me?
Isn't it true that you own a gun?
You'll never guess what I found.
She seems rich.
We've been friends for a long time.
You can't prevent him from drinking.
The pleasure was mine.

This car won't start.
I'll leave it up to your imagination.
The lawyer appealed to the jury's sense of justice.
I need water.
Tom doesn't care.
You can't end our relationship this way.
Those children have no one to care for them.
"If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave."
Tom was very nice to me.
Tom is by no means unintelligent. He is just lazy.
She turned away and began to cry.
Make sure you're here on time.
The boy drew a picture on the wall.
She is a most beautiful lady.

We live on the third floor.
No one could've predicted this.
Could you leave us alone?

Someday I'll run like the wind.
Of course!
We are in a difficult situation.

I have no desire to do that.
The flame went out.
Tom hates children.
Do you know Tom Jackson?
I only found out about that a few days ago.

Stop doing that.
That doesn't concern you.
My neighbor complained about the noise.
I'll never leave you.
Here comes Tom.
"Give us two knives and four forks, please."
What do you take me for?
He couldn't come because he was sick.
Examine this.
"You are a friend of Tom's, aren't you?"
I write letters almost every day.
Are you optimistic?
I don't think I'm the only one who noticed.
Come early.
She's acting on instinct.

Their curiosity was aroused.
One of my best friends has failed me.
Tom looked at Mary contemptuously.
You don't have to decide right now.

You haven't changed at all.
How did Tom react?
Tom stayed awake.
It looks like you're thinking about something else.
I hate dogs.
Girls don't like you.

The streets in Hokkaido are wide.
This is my husband.
What was Tom doing out there all by himself?
Is it popular?

We want to see Tom.
I want you to do that with Tom.
Would you like to eat some pudding?
There was a larger crowd at the concert than we had anticipated.
They're harmless.
I'll let you know when it has been decided.
Is there a restaurant close by?
Yellowstone National Park is located in Wyoming.
I think we need to be careful.
You have made it.
The man walked round the corner.
Mary asked Tom to shave off his beard.
Are meals included?
The movie theater was filled with people.
Someone must have left the water running.
We have been here for three days.
My bicycle has a flat tire.
Summer is over.
The judge's decision is final.
This seems unlikely.
Act like a man.
You can use my bicycle.
Fruits and vegetables are essential to a balanced diet.
I leave for Australia tomorrow.
You should have learned how to swim when you were young.
She told me her secret.
Let me explain.
Your efforts are futile.
I don't understand what you mean.
You should stop that.
Please don't drink from the bottle.
She made the same mistake again.
Tom is unaffected.
It was never our intention to deceive you.
You have too many books on the shelf.
Would you mind if I ask you a personal question?
Tom practices every single day.
He doesn't want to go to school.
That's just the way I like it.
What a selfish woman!
I liked your story.
There were thirty people present at the meeting.
Have you and Tom been fighting again?
I don't see Tom's car.
She needed the entire afternoon to complete the work.
They are much taller than us.
Everyone loves puppets.
I know what this is about.
Anything worth doing is worth doing well.
Tom slipped.
I bought a slow cooker.
We have a right to demand a safe future for ourselves and future generations.
He works at night.
You know what Tom's answer is going to be.
We're on our way.
You'll be dead someday.
Have you wondered why Tom doesn't come here anymore?
What would you recommend we eat?
It was an easy decision.
It's all mine.
How much do you love me?
I convinced Tom not to sue you.
I can not bear this noise any more.
Children and drunks don't lie.
He had a hard time making a living.
Let's have dinner.
He constantly criticizes other people.
Did someone die?
How should I know?
Tom and Mary are my best friends.
He went so far as to say that I was coward.
What don't we know?
Are you blowing me off?
We have two sons.
He hated lying.
Please take a bath.
The teacher sat on the chair.
Tom didn't meet Mary or anyone else.
We've spent too much time goofing off. Now it's time to get down to work.
We have known her for years.
I shouldn't have wasted my time reading that.
Will you watch the Olympics?
I used to play tennis when I was a student.
Organic food tastes better.
I didn't know you were superstitious.
Tom would've been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
I have to say I envy you.
There's nothing left to worry about.
He has stopped smoking.
"In judging his work, we must take his lack of experience into account."
I hate when this happens.
The man set himself on fire.
Cover your head when you are in the sun.
What we did was unnecessary.
I want to spend all my time with you.
Tom promised me he'd never come back here again.
What do you see here?
Tom put the cups on the shelf.
I have no idea what this is about.
We don't have that.
"Come on, don't be a coward!"
Tom bad-mouthed Mary to all his friends and family after their breakup.
What's that little blinking light?
He went through a very hard time.
I'm beginning to think you're serious.
Tom isn't at the hotel.
Respect your elders.
I washed my hands.
"You're drunk, Tom. Get in the taxi. We're going home."
I got the machine running.
This tie doesn't go with my suit.
He is a fish dealer.
Did you hear that?
I want to know why you don't like me.
You have to stop.
I don't deserve your friendship.
I'd rather not continue this conversation.
Tom is going through a very difficult time.
"If you don't believe me, go see for yourself."
Tom lost consciousness.
I like listening to him.
I should put on more clothes.
"I'm talking about this pen, not that one over there on the desk."
This book is easy enough for children to read.
Tom plays tennis every day.
"What're you saying, Tom?"
It was a shock to hear about Tom's divorce.
What did you buy it for?
He learns fast.
I'm sure of his success.
Tom celebrated his twentieth birthday last week.
I need coughing medicine.
"Don't, under any circumstances, play poker with Tom."
"I know you're busy, too."
There is a traffic jam on the highway.
"I've been back for a week, but I'm still suffering from jet lag."
Tom is the chief.
This is a daily occurrence.
"After I graduated from college, I spent two years traveling around the world."
Are you at home?
Do you live there?
We love it here.
They went to the zoo by bus yesterday.
Get it ready at once.
I don't mind standing.
"As soon as the rain stopped, the tennis match continued."
She takes everything for granted.
Trusting yourself is the key to success.
Don't you want to go with Tom?
You can always ask me for help.
"May I see a menu, please?"
He has a prejudice against foreigners.
When are you flying back to Boston?
Here's something I want you to give to Tom.
He and I are friends.
Tom screamed at the top of his lungs.
It's close to my house.
I've just lost the best friend I ever had.
I met him about noon.
The whole town was very clean.
I was afraid to say no.
Do you know his older brother?
The phone number for the Thursday evening phone conference is 415-904-8873.
My brother likes horror movies.
Smallpox was unknown to Native Americans.
You're good at this.
Where is the nearest shop?
I agreed with him on the plan.
Her skirt is yellow with polka dots.
I don't know where my keys are.
She lay on a sofa with her eyes closed.
Tom would've loved this movie.
Please feel free to ask questions.
Can you please just shut up already?
Tom had nothing to eat.
That one's good.
Talk like that will raise suspicion.
You're quite a liar.
It's a worrying matter.
"Could I have a knife and fork, please?"
"I want your opinion, too."
Thanks for the comment.
A nervous person will not be fit for this job.
It is not more than ten minutes' walk from here.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
I'm sure it would mean a lot to Tom if you'd visit him in the hospital.
How curious!
I can't stand the cold.
Are you really going on the date with Tom?
We need to talk to you about Tom.
Who were you waiting for at the station?
I bought him a drink in return for his help.
Is this your first visit to this town?
She is muttering to herself.
"To our surprise, Tom came to our party with Mary."
He was ready to face his fate.
There is an urgent need for understanding how climate change will affect our lives.
I'm not going to work with you today.
Tom was carrying some shopping bags.
The couple led a happy life.
You're part of this.
I turned off the computer.
He felt for his matches and found them in his back pocket.
Things didn't go according to plan.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
That's too small to fit on your head.
Tom leaned back in his swivel chair.
She stayed there for a moment.
I don't know who you are.
May I join you?
I hope you didn't lend Tom any money.
Tom isn't budging.
His absence yesterday was due to his cold.
Tom is in love with the sound of his own voice.
We tried to stop them.
"You'll have to wear warm clothes, otherwise you'll catch a cold."
My father does nothing but watch TV on Sundays.
How many nights would you like the room for?
Tom probably doesn't know where Mary plans to spend her summer vacation.
I translated Tom's letter into French.
Our cat is missing.
Tom didn't say who he was planning to go with.
"Finally, I finished a painting."
I was forced to take medicine.
"She looked for her children, but couldn't find them anywhere."
I can't believe Tom really said no to me.
I don't see why Tom wanted me to be here today.
Tom tried to camouflage himself.
Do you have any money?
The storm caused a power outage.
I must go there.
You should have telephoned in advance.
Tom closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
It was such an interesting book that I read it in a day.
They speak many languages in Spain.
People can be cruel.
Tom raised his hand to ask a question.
He was too old to swim.
You will see the difference.
I often go fishing with them.
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
Tom doesn't like speaking French.
How did you find us?
I'll call her immediately.
It kept raining for three days.
The front door remained locked.
Where did you work before you started working here?
I'll ask Tom what he thinks.
May I interrupt you?
Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
A bowl of rice is about 180 grams.
Your birthday is coming soon.
We will never know how he's feeling.

Camels have either one or two humps.

A large crowd had gathered on the street.
They can't give me what I want.
Admission is free.
Where do you put the garbage in this kitchen?
"Tom is already here, but Mary isn't here yet."
They are my cousins.
What is the first novel that was written in Japanese?
Tom is violent and dangerous.
The mother told her daughter to do it herself.
I can't let you sacrifice yourself.
Don't change your mind so often.
Is Tom with Mary?
Look after the cat while I'm away.
We should have departed earlier.
It's been quite a week.
Tom likes running.
Tom died alone.
We lost our electricity because of the storm.
I fully agree with this.
A fool and his money are easily parted.
Please write this down.
He may have read the letter.
Did you have a good time yesterday?
Something you should know about me is that I spend a lot of time reading.
"If anybody could convince Tom, it would be Mary."
Did you get in trouble?
"Do you want to buy it? ""Yes."""
I want to be more like Tom.
There's one just near the station.
"Tom is not a lazy boy. As a matter of fact, he works hard."
Give me three more apples.
It's painful to be rejected.
The war broke out in 1939.
What does Tom want you to do?
This dog bites.
You're going to love this book.
We sought to come to terms with them.
I'm just trying to help.
Where will your friends sleep?
These socks do not match.
He usually goes to school by bus.
Tom is a charmer.
She detests speaking in public.
I couldn't make myself understood in French.
Everything matters.
We ran for 10 kilometers.
"What day of the week is it? ""It's Wednesday."""
Go to the hospital.
She will fail eventually.
"She sings well, to be sure, but she can't act."
She looks just like a girl I know.
"You're right, I think."
Tom gave me this.
The thief admitted his guilt.
Are you talking about Tom or yourself?

We can win.
You've got my computer and I want it back.
He was leaning against the rail.
Please come inside.
Tom lives on a busy street.
We've got no alternative.
I think you should lose some weight.
It's not even on the map.
What's your cat's name?
I have no trouble sight-singing baroque music.
That sounds like a great idea.
I won!
Doesn't that smell great?
How did your meeting with Tom go?
We have better weapons than the enemy does.
"I have an income of 50,000 yen a month."
Tom bought Mary a microscope.
Wasn't he your friend?
The moon is very beautiful this evening.
I'll do it according to your instructions.

What we need is help.
They nodded to each other.
He knows how to find water in the desert.
When have you ever done anything for me?
The cat jumped up on Tom's shoulder.
Who wrote the letter?
Tom was mad at Mary.
You'd better do that now.
I cannot thank you too much.
Tom tried to keep calm.
This painting is a good copy of the original.
Could you call me back a bit later?
You're losing your hair.
Tom often acts like a baby when he can't get his way.
Has Tom called yet?
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
He inherited the business from his father.
Tom isn't very funny.
I had no choice but to throw him out.
There are 30 classes in our school.
Why can't you just be honest?
I'm so happy you could make it.
You're speaking a little too fast for me. Would you speak a little more slowly?
I washed the dishes after supper.
I went to the station.
He's really quick.
He showed me how to use this camera.
You're very good.
I'm not worried about it.

Would you like me to get you a cab?

Which chair did you put the book on?
I finally escaped.
You and Tom must be so happy.
Tom is expendable.
You're taking over.
You can go home now if you like.
Everyone is against me.
I'm not trying to impress you.
Do you know what you've done?
That's what brought us together.
These books aren't for children.
They made a promise.
I know where you can find Tom.
I don't get paid as much as I'd like.
Science is very exciting.
My father will help me.
I wanted to help you.
"Don't ask questions, just come with me."
You don't need to go at once.
Tom wants me to do that.
Tom and Mary are playing darts.
I've been looking for this for a long time.
I'm not going to be afraid anymore.
Don't call me again.

She got married against her father's will.
Tom looks after his mother.
Is it too big?
It's getting larger.
Which animals make the best pets for children?
You aren't Canadian.
This is none of your business.
I wonder why Tom didn't recognize you.

Today is Sunday.
Do you want to know?

Breakfast is at half past nine.
The problem is not worth consideration.

I'm sure you'll have enough time.

"Do you have any siblings? ""No, I'm an only child."""
My house is like yours.
The house stank.
Where is the train station?

"Write with a pen, not with a pencil."
He was giving a speech.
I speak French and English.
Who found my bag?
I'll get you back home.
When did you visit New York?
I don't have that.
One million people lost their lives in the war.
Tom became curious.
I asked him to open the window.
I haven't been married long.
Tom rode his bicycle down a quiet residential street.
Maybe that's the real problem.
You must take advantage of the opportunity.
Show me what you bought.
I'll do everything that I can.
I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.
You scared the living day lights out of me!
He lives apart from his family.
Don't you want to go with me?
We weren't at home yesterday.
How old was Tom when he started talking?
Am I correct in assuming that you wish you hadn't done that?
I'm deeply in love with you.
Tom became uneasy.
Could you bring me some water?
The tower is three hundred and twenty-one meters high.
What are you interested in?
Tom sat on the couch.
There are many birds in this park.
You're so romantic.
It's not worth the trouble.

The rain turned to snow.
I must work hard to make up for lost time.
You probably think Mary is cute.
Please keep your cynical remarks to yourself.
It's been three years since the accident.
He let his books fall to the floor.

I thought you'd been notified.
I have a friend who is a pilot.
I'll see you next Wednesday.
I was a stranger in Boston.
What do you want for that?
It's just another story.
Tom was thirty when he died.
Have a wonderful evening.
I think that's a bad solution.
Why are you so dressed up? Where are you going?
Why did you tell this joke?
Tom restarted his computer.
I can't attend the meeting.
Your hair looks great.
I'm not giving up on you.
This is incorrect.
Do you want it or not?
I think it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to escape from this prison.
That is the same color as mine.
I heard it on the radio.
They went crazy.
I will spend next Sunday reading novels.
Please lend me your knife.
Tom may come and visit me any time he wants to.
I see a red car ahead.
I think Tom said that.
Tom burned the letter.
"No matter how hard you try, you won't be able to do it."
It does more harm than good.
Let's meet in front of the library.
Is it worth the risk?
Tom raised his hand.
I've never heard him complaining about his meals.
I guess you don't really care.
You're more than welcome to come over.

I've already promised not to do that.
He is a lonely man with few friends.
Tom is taking too long.
Tom makes me feel safe.
They're watching.
Am I supposed to be at the meeting on Monday?
Who'll start?
Do you have many hobbies?
I'll never forget the look on Tom's face.
You said it was important.
Tom wasn't hurt.
Isn't it easier to find your stuff when your room's tidy?
I hate it when guys do that.
We want one.
You should have kept it secret.
I wish I could speak English.
Tom stood looking out one of the windows.
Tom certainly had plenty of opportunities to go to concerts while he was in Boston.
I've never felt so alive.
I know why Tom is doing that.
One thing that won't change is my salary.
My mother is making dinner.
It's nothing you need to worry about.
Look up this word in the dictionary.
Tom had no intention of giving Mary any money.
They were walking along the street arm in arm.
He bought the picture for next to nothing.
That can't be it.
This is where I was born.
She did without necessities to pay for her daughter's lessons.
She married a musician.
I like to play poker.
"Tom doesn't want me to go, but I'm going to go anyway."
Tom is cross-eyed.
Tom and Mary want to talk to me.
How did you come by that much money?
Was Tom surprised?
Tom is embarrassed by what he did.
There's no way to save everybody.
This makes no sense.
Tom shouldn't have been doing what he was doing.
Something very strange happened last night.
I definitely won't do that again.
Tom and Mary became very good friends.
He flew to Paris.
I'm with my family right now.
I think this is yours.
You should have your eyes examined.
This bicycle belongs to me.
Where will you go?
Boys tend to look down on their younger sisters.
How do you know that Tom doesn't like Mary?
I added his name to the list.
Don't get on the train yet.
"If you don't believe me, go and see it for yourself."
"Every time Tom shows up, it rains."
I've been better.
We must cut down our expenses.
Tom has never killed anybody.
Their loss is our gain.
Tom put the twenty-dollar bill that Mary gave him in his shirt pocket.
He gave me a hug.
How did you spend your vacation?
Tom said Mary was willing to do that tomorrow.
Won't you take a chair?
She isn't poor.
Tom must be home by 2:30.
Why isn't Tom happy?
Are you sure you don't want to go swimming with us?
Tom is no longer a suspect.
I didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
They're now alone.
His son has what it takes to be a good doctor.
Time to get up.
Tom and Mary have nothing in the world except each other.
I'm so tired that I don't feel like studying tonight.
This milk tastes odd.
Tom flirted with the waitress.
It seems that the store is closed today.
I'll wait here until she comes.
Do you watch the news every day?
This is just like old times.
Tom has been teaching us French for the past four years.
Could you give us a minute?
What is that over there?
He bumped his head against the ceiling.
You are no younger than I am.
I don't like to sit outside.
We're the same age.

It was the bad weather that caused his illness.
We can't leave Tom here. He won't survive on his own.
Tom has a good ear for music.
I will never change my mind.
He was not a good speaker.
How old is the oldest one?
I get by.
Is that what you have in mind?
That is all right.
Tom is very frank.
My father didn't allow me to marry him.
I can't see you anymore.
Tom talked all night.
Mary put the ring on her finger.
"When I arrived at the station, the train had already left."
It is of little value.
Tom grimaced slightly.
Do you have a smartphone?
Which beer is yours?
I will come to see you next Sunday.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
This morning I missed the train I usually take.
I'm glad you're pleased.
A lion is an animal.
"I smell something burning, Mother."
I don't know if he knows it.
See you again.
Do you think I'm made of money?

Tom sat down.
I don't know what Tom will say.
Tom is out of the country.
I believe we can get that done.

The trouble is that he thinks only of himself.

Don't tell your mother what you've seen here.
You can get it at a bookstore.
Where has the time gone?
Tom is in London on business now.
Tom has three kids.
You must do as I say.
He shined his shoes.
Iceland belonged to Denmark.
They loved Nagasaki so much that they stayed there for a week.
Tom seems kind.
Tom is very lonely.
I didn't know that would happen.
Which do you suppose she chose?
Tom should've protected Mary.
I don't know Tom as well as I know you.

The office has been transferred up to the sixth floor.

I kind of agree with you.

Do you always watch TV in the evening?
Tom and Mary are out.
Tom is going to love living here.
I'm a Japanese student.
He will soon be a father.
The ceremony took place in the afternoon.
"Frankly, I'm not that impressed with his idea."
You must on no account do such a thing.
Is it lunchtime already?
I've run out of patience.
I want to apologize to you for calling you a jerk in front of your girlfriend.
My sister is older than my brother.
Where did you buy your schoolbag?
Tom complained that he couldn't find a job.
Can I have some more tea?
I can't kiss you the way you want to be kissed.
That's unimportant.
How old did you say Tom was?
We're not going to answer any more questions.
I hoped you would understand what I meant.
I'm thinking of going.
"As to your final grade, that depends on your final examination."
I'm glad I've found you.
Beat it.
I'll fix it now.
No one will ever find out.
Take lots of vitamin C to avoid catching cold.
"After digressing, he returned to the subject."
Tom has been sick for a very long time.
You are to blame.
Tom is doing his work.
Tom guessed my weight.
He must be nearly forty.
I went for a walk in the park.
We just want to know whether Tom is coming or not.
I found the building.
Mary watches TV every night.
What else did Tom want?
Tom asked for a wake-up call.
Tom gave me a dictionary.

I can't remember how to do it.
You can do that tomorrow.

Tom looks like someone who's used to being alone.
Why do you despise people?
This book is boring.
We would be very pleased if you paid us a visit.
I don't particularly like Tom.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
How are we going to get by?
Why are you asking Tom?
Do you like it when I do this?
Do you think that that's fair?
I feel dizzy.
The bathtub needs to be cleaned.
Tom wanted to help Mary do the right thing.
I don't want to hear a thing about it.
My conscience is clear.
You don't have a choice.
I put on my clothes in a hurry.
"I wish I could be more optimistic, but I don't think things will get better soon."
The library is eighty years old.
They'll come looking for you.
Cats are afraid of water.
Aren't you happy?
The idea is not bad.
I'd like to know what Tom is up to.
This is for your protection.
He was nearly hit by the car while crossing the street.
Is this really allowed?
We should get going.
People used to think that women who looked odd were witches.
I should've been there.
May I borrow that book from you?
Can I bring you anything else?
I've never heard of such a thing.
Terrific!
She hates speaking in public.
Her mother started shouting.
I go to school.
I've already done that once today.
My predictions were accurate.
They died in battle.
What's bugging you?
Are you two happy?
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
Tom didn't do that for us.
I'm ready to admit it was my fault.
What made you think that Tom wouldn't come?
Would you like to go on a trip with me?
This bird can imitate the human voice.
I am loved by my mother.
I don't want to run such a risk.
Your suitcases are over there.
Tom is the only person who can help me.
They say it's very good.
Tom is scolding Mary.
There is a great deal of traffic on this road.
I can't do this either.
I have an exam tomorrow.
Do you believe me now?
"At about the same time, Tom was in his room studying."
Please feel free to ask me any question.
You'll get your money.
This medicine tastes bitter.
I found it while I was cleaning up.
Tom returned Mary's stare.
I can't believe that you like that restaurant.
Tom often has trouble remembering things.
Do you want to go somewhere else?
The soldiers filled the sandbags with sand.
I hate that movie.
This place still looks the same as it did a long time ago.
Tom made Mary do it.
Tom is a reckless driver.
Are you watching me?
Right now I'm at the airport.
Have him wait a moment.
You were never here when I needed you.
How about a walk?
Tom was really impressed.
He came into the room.
"Even though there was a no U-turn sign, I made a U-turn."
There's no water.
Tom didn't see me.
When did you arrive in China?
"No matter where I go, I get lost."
Tom ordered pizza.
I should go home and get some sleep.
She doesn't live there any more.
I'm not a woman.
I made friends with her.
Thank you for calling me back.
Have you ever seen a lion?
I don't know anything about Tom's past.
"When I'm with a crying baby, I end up wanting to cry myself!"
There are only two days left.
I have complete faith in my doctor.
It must've been very difficult for you.
"Where is your house? ""It is over there."""
I missed the train by thirty seconds.
They're coming here.
Tom has denied everything.
Someone left you a message.
I know a man who can speak Russian well.
Where are we going to meet?
This'll do.
Tom gave Mary a wave.
I just didn't feel like getting up.
Tom dreamed of becoming a rock star.
Could you turn on your headlights?
He has begun on a new book.
My roommate complained about the noise.
I'm sorry. I was only joking.
You should get your eyes examined.
No one is above the law.
Has Tom ever fallen in love?
He regretted not having taken my advice.
How much food do you need?
The income from this source is tax-free.
"Tom said something, but I couldn't hear what he said."
Is he dead?
There's no such thing as luck.
I had the same problem.
I got your messages.
Give me an example.
Do we need to do this again?
Tom is on the baseball team.
I think you should cut Tom some slack.
Tom finds Mary's mother to be quite intimidating.
She is lucky.
This was popular in the nineties.
Africa is exporting beef to Europe.
Tom is one of the richest men in the world.
Tom is watching TV in his room.
Tom has been lucky.
Tom thanked Mary for her help.
You know almost everything about me.
Let's leave the decision to Tom.
Tom made Mary very happy.
"Tom and Mary want you there, too."
Sunday is the day when I am busiest.
Be careful. Don't throw away those papers.
What's the matter with you? You look pale.
This summer is incredibly hot.
You should probably tell Tom why he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom and I have a lot more in common than I thought.
Everything depends on money.
It would be great if we could meet again.
She's very ill and has been in bed for a week.
He himself tried it.
Please don't throw the bottle out the window.
It's going to be great.
Be at the station at 11 o'clock sharp.
Can you throw that away for me?
He made us do the work.
Tom is considering visiting his uncle in Boston.
Why doesn't Tom like this hotel?
There is something for everyone at this hotel.
It never existed.
Tom walked off the dance floor.
Tom saw Mary's footprints in the mud.
"Usually, they did not stay long."
I know what you said.
I want to go there once more.
Let's try to treat each other with respect.
You aren't alone.
Is the job too much for you?
Be quiet and listen.
I did what I could. It's your turn now.
His mother didn't want to do it.
We don't want it.
Are you a teacher here or a student?
The foreign minister attended the talks.
English is a language spoken all over the world.
Get away from me.
We know about Tom.
She hit him.
Let me call Tom.
Why didn't anyone say anything?
The court acquitted him of the charge of murder.
Tom seems to be very excited.
I can teach you how to translate.
I don't know where you are going.
I unplugged the TV.
Was Tom funny?
May I have your name?
Tom and I introduced ourselves to each other.
How do you like my new suit?
She accused me of making a mistake.
"That's an ugly building, in my opinion."
Tom and Mary each took a sip of wine.
My grandpa blew out all 97 candles on his birthday cake.
Tom is looking forward to his birthday party.
Tom walked to the store to buy some milk.
We have been good friends for a long time.
Why are you on this ship?
We have lots of work to do.
He always speaks of the government with contempt.
He looked young.
Why did you buy the flowers?
I told them they shouldn't move.
Tom went cycling with one of his friends.
I explained the rules to her.
Hug Tom.
This is where I absolutely disagree with you.
This paragraph is vague.
He makes good use of his time.
He's an early bird.
I need to cancel my reservation.
Do you hit your children?
Tom is fairly pretentious.
I guess you've been to Boston before.
Tom ran out of money.
She got a part-time job as a typist.
This color is a bit darker than that one.
He spoke.
Tom said he couldn't do anything.
Tom admitted that he didn't eat the cake that his girlfriend had baked for him.
I painted the fence green.
Look at it.
Tom rented a room.
Tom had never driven a truck.
Tom was kissing Mary when I walked into the classroom.
Call Tom and tell him I can't meet him this afternoon.
The tree was ready to fall down.
My father is an early riser.
I've been waiting for this day to come.
He's every bit as clever as his friend.
I'll do anything you say.
He will be in New York for two weeks.
Could I have a cigarette?
Will you help me pack my suitcase?
Do you mind my turning on TV?
"Where are we going, Tom?"
She gave birth to twins.
I'll get in touch with you soon.
He is a really good worker.
"If you don't go, I won't, either."
Trying to do such a thing is a waste of time.
Why do you keep saying things you know are not true?
"Tom asked Mary many times to let him go home early, but she wouldn't let him."
Tom is an expert when it comes to cooking.
The smell's making me sick.
I really want to be a good teacher.
How many people do you know with disabilities?
Tom was wounded.
I just found it.
This custom dates from ancient times.
I dashed off the report.
The factory has been lying idle for a year.
We stopped for lunch at a local restaurant.
I anticipate that there will be trouble.
"Whether he comes or not, the result will be the same."
I am afraid the loss will amount to one hundred million dollars.
She took a ten-day trip to Europe with her friends.
The teacher punished her students for using bad words.
She's promised to give me a ring.
I have a plan. Don't worry.
Tom has an Australian accent.
We still have to do that.
She is able to skate.
Tom is likely to tell you some things that aren't true.
Tom has nothing to do here.
I often read books.
I will have a driving test tomorrow.
I hope you know it doesn't really matter all that much.
Tom is much older than I am.
When is school out?
Put it in a brown paper bag.
He put salt into his cup of coffee by mistake.
You're too inflexible.
It doesn't make much difference.
Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't here.
I get goose bumps when I see a horror movie.
I'm not sure how often I should be taking this medicine.
Am I in love?
What will happen to her?
I can ski.
I'm a translator.
"If you think that's necessary, you should do it."
I think Tom was looking for you.
I've got to know.
That's just the way I am.
It isn't a real apartment.
Tom must care about you very much.
Are you saying that I'm a liar?
They may go.
Tom forgave Mary breaking her promise.
"Whose cakes are these? ""They are Farida's."""
Skateboarding is dangerous.
Tom is crying.
I know what's going on here.
Tom plans to go on a vacation next week.
I hate raccoons.
Don't ask so many questions.
I'll call you tonight.
We have a lot of work to do today.
He asked me who had painted the picture.
You can go anywhere you like.
There was nothing for me to do but mount the horse.
Can you do that here?
You lied to Tom.
Mary has the most clothes of all her friends.
Both Tom and Mary work as models.
Tom seems like a happy child.
How did you and Tom meet?
Tom got here late.
Come to me.
You have an e-mail message in your inbox.
This class will be over in ten minutes.
I want you to leave now.
You are a bad person.
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Who did Tom say broke into his house?
The earth is like a ball with a big magnet in it.
The student became very nervous with the teacher watching him.
I really like you with a beard.
I want you to see this.
It was a perfect fit.
I never should've hired Tom.
"Apparently, Tom's death was a suicide."
Let me know what I can do to help.
Tom is in the bathroom.
It is not my day.
They do it each week.
Try not to be late again tomorrow.
He asked me for money.
How many times have you done this?
We were afraid that we might hurt him.
Do you like my friend?
I fell.
Will you give me a ride?
"If Tom had been careful, he wouldn't have gotten killed."
I haven't really told you anything you shouldn't have already known.
I don't feel like studying right now.
Everybody started cheering.
When will the rainy season be over?
They admired each other.
I apologized to her for stepping on her foot.
How old are your kids?
Would you like to eat something?
Is the dog swimming?
I can't hear you.
Tom died in 2013.
I think Tom had a good reason.
The files are missing.
Do you know who Tom is hiding from?
I knew it would never work between you and Tom.
You missed your chance.
Tom goes to kindergarten.
I hear you.
We associate the name of Einstein with the theory of relativity.
I don't know the details.
You are old enough to make your own living.
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
The fact is that I have no money with me.
How many songs have you written?
That would be suicidal.
Was that really worth it?
I still love him.
I didn't think Tom would be so stupid.
It was only a marriage of convenience.
Tom sounded tired.
The food here is terrible.
Why should Tom be any different?
Tom watched Mary put sugar in her coffee.
I'll say no more.
He should thank you.
Tom wants to see you as soon as possible.
"He's kind of cute, isn't he?"
I don't want Tom to give up.
He didn't keep his appointment.
Do you need my assistance?
She looked lonely.
Tom kissed Mary on her forehead.
Tom was creative.
They're very successful.
Get down from your horse.
I have been to London before.
My pride prevented me from borrowing money from him.
Don't forget your cigarettes and lighter.
I'll pick you up at six.
She became a police officer.
Why are you not listening to me?
Today is a good day.
Don't burst my bubble.
Tom is a big boy.
Tom is slow.
I feel like I won the lottery.
Go and see who it is.
We don't need to hurry.
I'd like to have a coffee.
I said I'd think about it.
I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
It's better to take your time at this job than to hurry and make mistakes.
I hate getting up early.
Tom is extremely romantic.
How large is your family?
I will speak with you tomorrow.
Tom is already married.
Will you go to the meeting in my place?
This is a new model.
"Calm down, son."
"I want one, too."
The situation is hopeless.
Tom likes to sit on the dock with his feet dangling in the water.
"What is it, Tom? What's wrong?"
You should've stood up.
Tom needs help.
My daughter is in the hospital because she was injured in a traffic accident.
I wonder what happened to Atlantis.
Why don't you ask Tom to babysit Mary and John?
That's child's play.
Just give me the car keys.
Tom politely pretended not to notice that Mary had been crying.
I think it was intentional.
He's afraid that he might be late.
I climbed in through the window.
Nobody wants you to do that.
I don't know them.
She is about your age.
You've found something.
I'm the only one here who knows what Tom looks like.
This pole is sharp at the end.
Do you know where my recipe book is?
I didn't let them know.
It's going to stay that way.
He thought I was my brother.
It was a compromise.
You're going to pay for this.
How should I know where he is?
How come you know French so well?
Will you give me a ride to my hotel?
Does your stomach hurt?
I bet you think I'm just writing that to impress you.
Is it true that you're Tom's brother?
Are you lying to me?
I have to agree with Tom on this one.
"The food wasn't very delicious, but otherwise the party was a success."
Tom turned off the radio.
That's what we do.
"Of course, Tom is wrong."
Have you been waiting a long time?
We spent more money than was expected.
This increase in unemployment is a consequence of the recession.
Tom saw Mary in the distance.
It's unforgettable.
"A nice day, isn't it? Why not go out for a walk?"
Don't go near the fire.
It is about time we bought a new microwave oven.
Tom has never been good at keeping secrets.
"Soon, he learned how to speak English."
I'm not doing this for the money.
You remind me of my daughter.
Where do you park?
There are many good restaurants in Boston.
"If anyone can do it, it's Tom."
I spent the whole day playing with my kids.
Why did you leave?
Why doesn't Tom answer?
Tom's efforts were rewarded.
I expect him to be here by three.
Tom relaxed.
The rain was beating against the windows.
Allow me to go.
"Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they are always there."
I think I've figured out which horse is most likely to win the race.
Tom and Mary tossed a ball back and forth.
I'm looking for something to clean the carpet with.
What do you think of my plan?
Aren't you supposed to be at work right now?
You look Japanese.
There's no way I'm going to leave you alone here.
"Which color do you prefer, blue or green?"
You can't miss it.
I know who you're thinking about.
There are many rats on the ship.
Tom lived in Boston.
We need to have a contract.
I heard the good news.
Both girls laughed.
I replied automatically when I heard my name.
I need to study math.
It's bad for business.
"You don't think you can win, do you?"
Tom took the money off the table.
He does not like us.
She took off the lid of the box.
My sister will be thirteen years old next summer.
Don't shout like that. I can hear you perfectly.
Am I invited?
Tom found a seagull feather on the beach.
Tom suddenly got incredibly nervous.
It is getting colder and colder day by day.
We're counting on you to help.
Next year my birthday will fall on a Sunday.
Is eating liver good for you?
Tom is a natural athlete.
I want to buy my house back.
Get away!
We have no idea about his whereabouts.
It's in the fridge.
Do you remember the day this picture was taken?
I never go anywhere.
Please keep me updated.
I appreciate you stopping by.
My son can't count yet.
Tom doesn't like Mary's living there alone.
Tom wants to see Mary again.
Tom hasn't yet told us what he wants us to do.
Why's Tom here and not Mary?
What was his reaction to this news?
What do you like?
The cat came near being run over by a truck.
Take the weight off your feet. Sit down and relax.
Tom lacks imagination.
We didn't need to get here so early.
The boys whispered among themselves.
I've been trying to cut down on caffeine.
My cat is following me.
I prefer walking to riding.
I'll try not to make mistakes next time.
Please come this way.
We've had a poor crop due to lack of water.
He lives off campus.
It was the worst night of my life.
Tom's watching.
"Great weather, isn't it?"
Sometimes I don't get you.
Put the book on top of the others.
"Stratford-on-Avon, where Shakespeare was born, is visited by many tourists every year."
"She's in high school, but her boyfriend is in college."
Where is my ball?
You don't drink enough water.
It all comes down to a question of time.
You didn't tell me Tom speaks French.
There is a TV remote control under the couch.
I'm not going to get up.
We'll help you out.
My robot's name is Maruchi.
May I ask you for your name and address?
It is just your imagination.
Tom appears to be a friendly person.
Did I pass the test?
Do you eat breakfast at home?
I helped my mother in the kitchen.
Mary fell in love with a handsome cowboy.
More and more people offered to help.
When did you start writing songs?
I'll send you a picture.
Let's go downtown.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.
I haven't eaten since breakfast and I'm very hungry.
We should play by the rules.
Tom accepted the job offer.
We can solve this problem easily.
Are you from Boston?
She had to use her dictionary many times.
I want to master a foreign language.
Don't be deceived.
He likes to talk about himself.
They wake up at six every morning.
I'm not well.
Who did you kiss?
He had to stay in bed.
Tom had nothing left to drink.
They are all very busy.
This CD costs ten dollars.
We will be living here next month.
Turn off the lights.
He didn't reveal his identity.
He might have lost his way.
"No, thank you. I'm full."
I was surprised to see you here.
I felt very sleepy.
I bought a watch.
Are you envious?
Tom caught a fish.
I bet you know this.
She has few friends.
Tell me the name of the ninth month.
"Tom has left, but Mary is still here."
He wouldn't even look at me.
This is a very common injury.
I will be back at half past six.
Why are you back from lunch so soon?
They had to work all year round.
"You sing in the choir, don't you?"
"If you could go back in time, what would you change?"
We never say goodbye to each other.
How's your mother?
You can hire a bicycle by the hour at this shop.
I hope Tom is right.
I can't decide whether to go or not.
I've still got work to do.
Tom almost won.
He's offered to help.
Go ahead and talk.
They just don't trust you.
Tom's great-great-grandfather was a pirate.
I don't want to lose you again.
How many times have you gone?
I know it's impossible.
Did you hear about Tom's fight with Mary?
Tom isn't fair.
I don't want to study French.
He has a firm belief.
It tastes like chicken.
Why are your eyes red?
I saw you working in the garden.
We sat there.
I drank coffee.
This beer contains 5% alcohol.
Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?
How did you kill the guards?
Your car is being towed.
It was so boring that I fell asleep.
We have to learn the whole poem by heart.
Tom definitely didn't want to be disturbed.
Tom will let Mary decide.
I like what you've written.
It's just a dream.
The Japanese destroyed Pearl Harbor.
I did something stupid.
A hare raced with a tortoise.
Are you angry at me?
The experiment succeeded.
It could have been me.
She is aware of my secret plan.
I feel terrible.
They're broken.
Tom did his best to protect Mary.
I was too astonished to speak.
Don't you say a word.
Tom is with him.
The police officer fired a warning shot.
"When I heard that, I put two and two together."
Is that your sister?
I didn't break any laws.
This service is temporarily out of order.
Tom didn't do anything wrong.
That has always been so.
I haven't been drinking.
There are signs of growing tensions between the two countries.
The rescue workers arrived two hours too late.
They smiled at one another.
Hundreds of people were killed.
I'm Tom's cousin.
Tom wasn't able to find a place to park.
"Tom, there's something you should know about me."
I don't want to speak ill of the dead.
"If you do that, you're going to subject yourself to ridicule."
Tom locked both doors and all of the windows.
Tom knew Mary wasn't very hungry.
I would love to read a book on the history of laughter.
I really hope you're kidding.
May I ask your name?
It's easy money.
My father quickly scanned the newspaper.
I love you.
"Tom doesn't ever say ""hi"" to his neighbors."
The merry-go-round rotates clockwise.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.
They hurried to the scene of the accident.
I love this photo.
I don't have a crush on Mary.
Our office is located in the center of the town.
Tom set the table.
Tom is likeable.
Are you feeling better today?
"Not only his son, but his daughter is famous as well."
Is there something in particular that you want?
This is the most beautiful flower in the garden.
That's nothing new.
Let's go by bus.
What's wrong with how we did it?
Why's Tom being mean to Mary?
We knew you were sick.
Tom woke up with a headache.
She is what is called a genius.
He knows what's going on.
I wouldn't have succeeded without Tom's help.
Either we all go or nobody goes.
"Tom isn't your name, is it?"
Tom decided to go abroad.
"If I were rich, I would do so. As it is, I can do nothing."
Tom hasn't eaten anything in the past 36 hours.
Tom breakfasted alone.
I became angry.
I don't take orders from you.
He looks young for his age.
I want to dance.
I don't trust anyone here.
Tom has a private plane.
That's where I'm going.
Tom couldn't fall asleep so he got up and took a walk.
I'm Tom's mother.
He comes back from Sydney today.
We all believe in something.
Tom got along with everybody.
Tom didn't lose his temper.
Do you think English is difficult?
"When I got up this morning, I had a headache."
Tom never comes.
I'd like to make an appointment with Dr. King.
I had a tennis match with him.
Living abroad is the best way to learn a foreign language.
He found her irresistible.
I have a sweet tooth.
I think you've been lied to.
I had to compromise on this point.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
India is a developing country.
You're making a big mistake.
President Jefferson was angry.
What's changed since then?
Tom wants a word with you.
What's your occupation?
We thought about that.
I'm bad at tennis.
We require your help.
Tom stared into the impenetrable blackness of the night sky.
Tom tripped.
He is good at solving complicated mathematical problems.
I cut myself shaving this morning.
I don't see you.
I made an apple pie for you.
Tom has a lot of money now.
The only way is up.
That football is made of genuine leather.
Don't you ever let me hear you talking to your mother like that again.
That man has one box.
Tom never had to study very much.
Tom goes to work by bus.
They cannot stop him.
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
What does Tom want to know?
She dyed her hair blonde.
Tom and Mary want to get married.
You're cooperating.
What's today's date?
I've already signed the contract.
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.
Tom is on his way home.
My hair is too long.
Their habitat is threatened by deforestation.
Tom ironed his clothes.
You can't show this video to anyone.
That dog runs very fast.
Just tell me the truth. I promise I won't get mad.
Tom had great respect for Mary.
I can't fall asleep.
You obviously have no interest in saving yourself.
Which dog is yours?
Tom goes for a walk every morning.
Welcome to my humble abode.
We don't have to be here.
I'll see you the day after tomorrow.
You'll suffer because of that.
Many newspaper reporters attended the trial.
I had to defend myself.
The cat likes to sleep beside me.
Tallinn is the capital of Estonia.
Are you free on Friday afternoon?
I wrote that book.
She came close to drowning.
What happened here?
I need to borrow some money.
Tell me all about your plan.
Look here.
There was a bus schedule on the wall.
Tom told me he was disappointed.
We don't know how or why.
The price of the book was $5.
"I could have killed you, but I didn't."
He pretended to be sick.
No other mountain in Japan is higher than Mt. Fuji.
Say hello to your friends.
It's too late now.
Tom left early.
"Nearly one billion people around the globe lack access to clean, safe water."
I asked Tom to do that.
Thank you for building this wall.
Sometimes the first symptom of cardiovascular disease is death.
I thought you were going steady with Tom.
Let's go outside and play in the snow.
I should've apologized to Tom.
Don't take things so seriously.
I am a student.
Who did you call?
We haven't heard from Tom in a long time.
Do you know who he is?
Soldiers are trained to use weapons.
Tom looked.
I've changed my website's layout.
I wish Tom had never gotten out of prison.
I want to keep my car there.
Tom lived with us for three months.
Winter is coming soon.
Tom is extremely shy.
When did you buy it?
Death is inevitable.
I can't get a straight answer from Tom.
I don't mind if I get wet.
You've got nothing to worry about.
"Just don't do anything stupid, OK?"
I know that it's highly unlikely that I'll be able to convince you that you're wrong.
I teach French to adults.

He left everything to chance.
Our son died in the war.
Tom thinks I'm crazy.

You need a vacation.
Which one do you like best?
He had fun with it.
You're not my girlfriend.
Tom barely speaks to us anymore.
He looked around uneasily.
Does French have a similar expression?
His answer was to strike me on the head.

Where are you on Monday?
I have a friend living in London.

"Right now, we have to find out what happened."
She nodded her head in agreement.
Tom is a graduate student.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
Spring comes between winter and summer.
It isn't cheap enough for me to buy.
Tom is my ex-boyfriend.
How did you come up with such a good excuse?
Would after lunch be convenient for you?
Tom has finally shown his true colors.
Tom can't read or write.
These measures can prevent the disease from spreading.
What a big ship that is!
Tom is biased.
I forgot to explain everything to Tom.
I should visit Tom.
All the boys are the same age.
One of the coat's sleeves is shorter than the other.
They don't know each other very well.
Tom is brain damaged.
Is Tom awake yet?
She held him by the sleeve.
Take your time. There's no rush.
Don't listen to him.
Tom seems much happier than Mary.
Tom's hands were dirty.
"Can I get you a beer? ""Do you have anything stronger?"""
She is my classmate.
He did the best he could.
He has a Picasso.
Tom is loud.
"In my opinion, you are wrong."
Don't you know how?
"If there's something bothering you, you need to tell me."
This fact must not be forgotten.
What are your plans for today?
I'm looking for my contact lens.
Tom raised his hat.
Tom poured Mary a glass of wine.
"Tom, are you there?"
Tom tossed and turned all night.
I just want your love.
He loves soccer.
You didn't answer me.
He fought against racial discrimination.
Why don't you look into the problem yourself? It's your responsibility.
We are at home today.
Does he come here?
Don't you know his name?
I will learn.
You'll have to come tomorrow.
"I like walking, especially in the morning."
Are you absolutely certain about this?
The ship came in sight.
I need that information now.
Don't be worried.
I hope to graduate from university next spring.
Turn off the TV.
I told you guys to go home. Why are you still here?
What are you drinking?
Make sure you don't forget to apologize.
Go on ahead. I'll catch up with you soon.
That's a given.
Let me do my job.
Bananas are delicious.
It's impossible to see Rome in a day.
Tom is there.
Tom didn't hunt.
Tom needed the money badly.
She gave him a good kick.
"Go straight, then turn right."
Tom doesn't like women.
Would you like to go to a movie tomorrow night?
Did he look like a doctor?
Let's go to the flea market tomorrow.
Tom is driving me mad.
Where were you an hour ago?
Los Angeles is the second largest city in the United States.
Maybe you should ask Tom.
I'm not going to say it again.
I'm afraid she will turn down my request.
Do you like spring or autumn?
It's unlikely that he'll want to get involved.
Come on. You can do it.
You're aggressive.
The teacher stood before the class.
May I open the window?
The ship flashed a distress signal.
He dismissed most of his men.
Tom's palms were sweaty and his mouth was dry.
We need to do things differently.
I took off my hat and entered the church.
You'll learn how to do it sooner or later.
Tom has no brothers or sisters.
All you have to do is sign this paper.
Take Tom's weapon.
Tom won't even talk to Mary anymore.
Is that my mug?
My boss refused my request for a raise.
I know you better than your wife does.
Aren't you pushing it too far?
I like to spend winters in Germany.
Excuse me.
I am a shy boy.
I want to eat breakfast outside.
I agreed with Tom.
It's wrong to lie.
"Tom speaks French fairly well, doesn't he?"
Tom noticed the ring on Mary's finger.
I caught him trying to go out of the room.
I called Tom.
She pondered the question for a while.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Everyone on the bus was asleep except the driver.
Tom is going to try to persuade Mary not to do that.
Tom knew what was hidden in the cave.
"He can dish it out, but he can't take it."
He is by nature a generous person.
I lost my key.
She takes great pride in her stamp collection.
It's crawling with spiders.
She has a rich vocabulary of English words.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
He gave an account of how he had escaped.
Tom walked home.
Tom lives in the lap of luxury.
Tom finished the work by himself.
Do you recognize the man in this photo?
Tom exceeded my expectations.
They'll find you.
Thanks for the update.
I wish Tom wouldn't keep bothering me with questions.
Their plane will soon take off.
She was allowed to go to the disco on condition that she was back by ten.
That was really interesting.
She's old enough to take care of herself.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom is thinking of selling his house.
Tom seems to be unwilling to accept advice from native speakers who try to help him with his translations.
What would've happened if Tom had come?
What does the doctor think is wrong with Tom?
This is my sister.
"The morning after I arrived there, I took a walk into the woods of oaks."
Perhaps we overlooked something.
I can't get Tom to help me.
Both Tom and Mary got in the car.
Could you put this report into Italian for me?
I'm very good at it.
Why did you cry?
"When I heard the news, I cried."
I'm glad to see you enjoy your work so much.
How many boys are there in your class?
I was very much surprised by her sudden change of mind.
Are you going to call Tom?
"Not having seen him before, I'll not be able to recognize him."
This system has obvious defects.
I've had enough.
Why did you come here?
It is no use asking him again.
I'll come by and pick you up tomorrow morning.
He promised to come home early tonight.
"In any case, we'll go."
Tom knew who Mary was planning to marry.
The population of Japan is less than America.
We will talk over the matter later.
That news report is inconsistent with the facts.
Research on the causes of cancer is very expensive.
I really think you should put some pants on.
We don't like the rain.
Tom can't help you.
Tom turned in a blank test paper.
Is this what you want?
Tom doesn't have a credit card.
Keep on smiling.
He is very slow at making friends with anybody.
They'll be watching you.
Tom is an outlaw.
I'm not obese.
It's a democratic government.
He whispered to me that he was hungry.
Take precautions.
I want to speak to my lawyer.
You're home early.
I need an envelope.
We don't miss anything.
Can you please pour me some more wine?
That's a no-brainer.
Why don't you understand?
Tom can't leave now.
You have to learn the basics first.
It'll surely rain today.
You must not lose sight of your main object.
He's not much as a singer.
I see what's going on.
What should we wear?
It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
This is OK.
We saw what looked like an oasis in the desert.
You must not leave right now.
I think Tom has to go to Boston.
I want it to happen.
Your o's look like a's.
He did the right thing.
"On hearing the news, she fainted."
We'll be there.
I've heard that sitting up straight is bad for your back.
Can you translate this for me?
We have to get him to the hospital before it's too late.
Do you want a second opinion? I can get another doctor to come here right away.
Tom and Mary went for a walk even though it was raining.
I'm very busy these days.
My back hurts.
Tom will be staying at least until next Monday.
Can you explain that to me?
I don't want to go to the hospital.
We can't last long in this heat.
Should I drive on the way back?
That's what's going on.
He's watching the Olympics.
How is that good for us?
Tom never lies.
Our project failed.
Where is Tom going to go?
You had better see a doctor at once.
I see how dangerous it is.
I'm not the only one who got here early.
I don't know those people.
I plan to telephone Tom tomorrow and ask him to help.
This semester I failed two students for plagiarism.
Come and take a look.
He is bound to succeed.
Unwrap it carefully.
Tom has been extremely cooperative.
Carry on with your work.
It wasn't enough.
You should be reading Shakespeare's sonnets.
You look like you've been doing something you shouldn't.
Hunting is prohibited in national parks.
Tom was married.
You're hard to understand.
Who sold you this car?
Tom should definitely visit an art museum or two while he's in France.
My friends congratulated me on my success.
I didn't read it all.
I've heard of you.
I'd appreciate any help you can give me.
Tom isn't violent.
How can I get in touch with you?
I don't know what Tom will think.
What's Tom good at?
The washing machine is out of order.
Can you think of anything that I could say to convince Tom to stay?
My father isn't at home.
We share a dream.
This car is going to break down.
Tom's been so busy lately he doesn't know whether he's coming or going.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom wants Mary to meet his mother.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
The relationship between husband and wife should be based on love.
The spare tire is in the trunk.
He came to pick me up.
Tom spent the night alone in the woods.
Tom had a bad dream.
He suddenly noticed his wallet was missing.
Why don't we have enough food for everyone? I thought you went shopping this afternoon.
Did you get my email yesterday with the instructions?
This is a picture of my car.
"At this rate, we won't be able to buy a house."
He is satisfied with the result.
Didn't you hear a scream?
I don't understand a word of what he says.
Tom hasn't bought a new pair of shoes in three years.
What's your native language?
Tom hardly ate anything at all.
This can is leaking.
Stay where you are.
Come in already.
Watch carefully and you can see how my lips move in pronouncing the word.
"Due to the reason that I described above, I arrived at a different decision."
How long did it take you to write this report?
It was this fountain pen that I bought in Paris.
Mary punished her daughter for lying.
He realized his dream of becoming an artist.
You don't have to worry about me.

He was as good a pianist as his mother.
Tom and Mary eat lunch together every day.
I promise I won't tell.
"He returned to his native village, where he spent the last few years of his life."
Tom never wins at tic-tac-toe.
Let's try!
Have another cup of coffee.
Her older sister got married last month.
There's a rock in my shoe.
Please hurry. We're late already.
Look at what you've become.
Please wait until I come back.
Tom thinks he knows what Mary wants.
Tom picked the lock and entered the room.
It was a pleasure working with you.
I added your name to the list.
I would rather read a book at home than go out tonight.
We need some new ideas.
Nobody can control us.
The man robbed him of all his money.
They told me to park anywhere I wanted.
Tom didn't show.
The tiger was killed.
You were late for work.
We're from Boston.
We queued up to get tickets for the concert.
Can I talk to you a moment?
Why is everybody afraid of Tom?
I led the way.
This is interesting.
Where do I know you from?
The police found a body washed up on the beach near here.

What was in it for you?
I assume you're willing to take the risk.
When does your passport need to be renewed?
Tom has been texting me.
Tom and Mary were in a hurry to get to school.
"Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise."
Is that car yours?
Just check it.
She doesn't listen to music at all.
"Go on Tom, drink it."
It's a work in progress.
I think there's someone out there.
What do we tell Tom?
What did you guys do?
Tom returned the keys to Mary.
Tom ran off.
Do they live with you?
What will become of Japan?

Tom sat on a tree trunk.
Is the museum visited by many people?
Did you happen to hear what Tom and Mary were talking about?
Smoke was rising from the chimney.
He came home late last night.
Tom told me where you hid the gold coins.
The price reflects the demand.
It just didn't work.
Nothing ever happens here.
"Without your help, I would have failed."
Tom has apparently tried to commit suicide.
I lost the watch.
Please iron the shirt.
You'll make it.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Tom is singing.
He pushed the cat into the swimming pool.
Your face is red.
Get away from here.
We have plenty of time.
I can't really remember.
What're you doing in my office?
She acknowledged that my statement was true.
What have you got there in your pocket?
I can't believe I didn't even think of that.
He once had a lot of land.
I help my mother with the housework every day.
Tom and Mary soon became friends.
I don't know who he is.
I am ashamed of your conduct.
Do you want me to read this out loud to you?

Why would someone with Tom's experience need our help?
This is where Tom used to sit.

The Nikkei index jumped dramatically just before closing.
No one's watching.
Make sure Tom comes.
I fail to see your point.
I'm pleased with his performance.
"Don't answer me back like that, Tom."
He is proud of his son.
He was involved in a murder case.
I've got a good reason not to like Tom.
"Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?"
This is more efficient.

My dream is to be a firefighter.
Do not give in to those demands.
Why don't you ask Tom if you can borrow his bicycle?

I think we can pull it off.
We need a little sugar.
I know the situation is very difficult for us.

No one's stopping you.
Tom had a farm not too far from Boston.
There must be a solution.
Tom and Mary had a baby girl.
Do you think Tom is in Boston?

Do you like rain?
Tom has a butler.
I wish she could have come.
Tom almost never says anything.
What method do you use to organize your files?

Will you cook something for me?
Do we even have a choice?
Tom should've finished doing that by now.

Tom is bound to forget.
I don't have a key.
Tom contributed.
I don't mind if the weather is hot.

Birds sing early in the morning.
It's not illegal.
Who's coming for dinner?
Don't bother to answer this letter.
That never changes.
I didn't lie to you.
Why does Tom always look so tired?
I was walking in the park with a friend of mine when it started raining.
I can't swim now as well as I used to be able to.
Is that so terrible?
Do it by yourself.
