When did you come back from Germany?
This bag is both good and inexpensive.
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
You'll be very happy here.
I suspect that Tom knows this already.
We'll see each other again.
When's the wedding?
We hope there won't be any bloodshed.
Don't you have any ambition?

I cannot approve your plan.
They said the deal was foolish.
"Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?"
My car's over there.
I don't think many people can say they are satisfied with their salary.
There's nothing I'd like more than to spend the afternoon with you.
I already knew the truth.
It was only yesterday that I called on him.
I feel perfectly fine.
Tom turned a somersault.
Tom knows wines.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
They love me.
She must have been very beautiful.
He fed his dog at the same time every day.
We're counting on you to help.

"I gave one to Tom, too."
I wish you could stay the night.
Do you have Tom's address?
I didn't order them.
"Tom, weren't you supposed to invite only one friend?"
Tom didn't try to go any further.
I'm not sure what's wrong. We should have heard from him by now.
I like doing that.
Something is very wrong here.
"If you have any doubts, let me know without any hesitation."
Are you sure you don't want to take a break?
"When I opened the window, I saw children playing baseball."
The dog fetched the ball.
We stood face to face with death.
I'm going to show this to Tom.
"It's your problem, not mine."
Please don't do it.
Tom and Mary are working nearby.
You're after Tom.
That's terrifying.
I'm asking what you think.
Can you give me some specifics?

You're a much better singer than Tom is.
Tom told me I'm better at doing that than Mary.
How much is this ring worth?
He demands immediate payment.
I can afford it.
She belongs to the Democratic Party.
Maybe you're right.
Please answer all the questions.
Stop pulling my hair!
Calm down.
Tom was wearing a mask to conceal his identity.
We should consider the problem from a child's perspective.
I was in the hospital for a week.
I ate a hasty lunch.
I may never see you again.
Don't you trust Tom yet?
She acknowledged that my statement was true.
I should have taken the money.
We're not going in there.
Tom took his children to the zoo.
I don't know where to buy imported cheese.
His loud voice drew my attention.
I have no idea what you mean.
Be careful not to scratch the furniture.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary's family.
Our plans are taking shape.
Have you finished your English homework yet?
My advice is to go home.
We need another three million dollars to complete this project.
That's why I told you not to go by yourself.
Tom is exceptionally good-looking.
I guess I have to trust you.
How much do you like Tom?
It's what I like.
I can't believe Tom left without saying goodbye.
Tom doesn't listen.
Tom is reformed.
He doesn't have his medication.
I've been practicing the piano all morning.
He was snoring loudly.
That man is on trial for the murder of a little girl.
Is it OK if I tell Tom about it?
Look at the picture on the wall.
I have no idea where we are.
"Even though Tom translated the letter for Mary, she didn't bother to read his translation."
"To the man who only has a hammer in the toolkit, every problem looks like a nail."
They sat on a bench in the park.
Do you shave your legs?
Tom doesn't know when Mary will be here.
Do you drink beer or wine?
Tom is singing in the shower.
I'm going to the post office.
He whispered the answer in my ear.
His house is within a stone's throw of his school.
He has nothing against it.
Are you hiding something from me?
I have time tomorrow morning.
"Don't open this door, please."
You haven't paid me yet.
The old castle is in a sad state.
I need to lose a few pounds.
I was going 120 kilometers an hour when the police stopped me.
How could you not tell me you know my parents?
I don't like that kind of music.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
I don't know which one to choose.
He is the older of the two.
"He didn't divulge the information, not even under pain of torture."
I'm a lot taller than Tom.
"English is difficult, isn't it?"
What does Tom see in Mary?
You look good in those clothes.
Please place your coat on the chair.
This book is easy enough for them to read.
I met him when I was a student.
I know that you love me.
Tom had hoped that he would win the lottery.
"He doesn't eat this, does he?"
Will you help me with my French homework?
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you like I should have been.
"Unfortunately, the whole thing fell apart."
Why are we still talking about this?
I am convinced that he is innocent.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
"Even though Tom left home early today, he was late for work."
We hate each other.
Getting involved with Tom was a mistake.
"A young dog is called a ""puppy."""
Everything's in order here.
Why do you keep giving him money?
They named their dog Lucky.
I want a glass.
All the students clapped their hands.
"What changes the world is communication, not information."
"My name is Tom, and this is Mary."
I have run out of money.
You're doing it right.
I have no idea where we are.
"We are good friends now, but there was a time when we didn't like each other."
I like working.
He just barely managed to pass the test.
Tom didn't ask me to do anything.
The radio on the desk is a Sony.
I want a room for tonight.
Tom is extremely aggressive.
Wait!
I hate watching TV.
You don't need to go to the dentist's.
We live in the atomic age.
I'll take a look at it.
Tom is going to do that.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent car.
Maybe a few of you have seen pandas in the zoo.
We're not going to give Tom the money he asked for.
It's difficult to understand his ideas.
Did Tom see this?
I'd like it if you would cook dinner for me.
Tom loves to sing.
You have a good reputation.
Tom was willing to try it again.
It's going to take at least an hour to get there.
We can't save everyone.
My situation has changed.
Welcome to our home.
I just want what I was promised.
The man groaned in pain.
Are you hiring?
There's a reason for it.
I can't stand the cold.
Aren't you going to come?
Tom is running in order to catch the bus.
I'm sure you're not going to like this.
Are you looking for something specific?
I made fun of him.
May I take off my coat?
It was lucky that you caught the train.
I can't imagine a future with no electricity.
Maybe Tom can do it.
Tom and Mary were very kind to me.
She's too young to get married.
I need someone to protect me.
It wasn't mine.
My father got home late last night.
Can you show me where I am on this map?
I was devastated.
Mary is very attractive.
The table takes up a lot of space in this room.
Tom just glared.
Tom slept in a hammock.
Yesterday I hit on a good idea.
I appreciate your kind words.
I'm hanging a picture of my grandmother on the wall.
It was warm and cozy inside.
"Tom is scared of Mary, isn't he?"
May I speak to you for a minute?
Tom will come with me.
What are you going to get?
I've been asking myself the same thing.
Tom lives in a wealthy neighborhood.
The first spacecraft from Earth to visit Mars was Mariner 4 in 1965.
"If you only had one more week to live, what would you spend your time doing?"
Tom didn't want to go to the doctor.
Are you at home?
You may as well go yourself.
I got a good grade in English.
Tom enjoyed himself a lot at the party.
Mary is folding the laundry.
That's what I say.
Tom is busy right now and he can't help you.
Tom said that he didn't mean to be late.
He must be over fifty.
They stopped running.
I can not get the message through to her.
Tom forgot to tell Mary that John had called.
He got up to see if he had turned off the light in the kitchen.
I'm using a new computer.
Tom isn't in a very good mood.
See you at 2:30.
Cows give us milk.
Tom spent the whole day reading in bed.
Why don't we just cancel the meeting?
I want to know who sent you.
What do you learn Spanish for?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
Tom didn't realize he was in any danger.
That's my CD.
A caged cricket eats just as much as a free cricket.
I have plenty of time.
Tom spoke again.
My phone is about to die.
People don't do that.
"I thought it was funny, too."
I'll take it to Tom.
I think I'll be fine.
"Unfortunately, an error has occurred."
He was waiting for a long time.
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
"For Hawking, writing this book was not easy."
It's dangerous to climb this mountain.
The pilot of an airliner is responsible for the safety of passengers.
What is the good of doing it?
She and I usually agree.
She shared her piece of cake with me.
I want to help if I can.
I can't make out what she said.
I was relieved to hear that he was alive.
I paid for Tom's ticket.
I need to be sure that you understand this.
I'll never forget the day when we first met.
She's open-minded.
We miss you very much.
Tom is strong.
I can see the top of the mountain.
Tom won the race.
Thank you for the wonderful gift.
Please help yourself.
I got off lightly.
She seems to be in love with my brother.
I just need to blow off some steam.
I'll be happy to go.
They do know what they're doing.
Don't worry about me.
I thought you had more sense than that.
Many workers were trapped in the coal mine.
I can swim very fast.
What medicine do you recommend?
I want to talk to Tom.
Please accept my condolences on the death of your father.
My whole body itches.
"If you trust such a fellow, you'll lose everything you have."
You're a good driver.
I've had a horrible day.
Tom is dying.
You have three minutes and thirty seconds left.
Please don't touch the merchandise.
What're you doing in my office?
"We're out of tissue paper, so I need to go buy some."
Send the letter airmail.
We're going out for Chinese.
A crowd was gathering around him.
I can't wait to see you.
I dislike living in such a noisy place.
He is beyond help.
You shouldn't play with knives.
He died a few hours later.
I shouldn't have wasted my time trying to convince Tom to change his mind.
Tom said that he thought I might need to do that by myself.
The buildings look so tiny.
Tom waved goodbye to Mary.
Few people are able to understand his theories.
That cannot be true.
It was her little sister that broke her toy.
I thought Tom was a complete idiot.
Tom is my mother's brother.
I am not about to pay ten dollars.
Does Tom live here?
"Are you happy now, Tom?"
What was it you wanted to ask me to do?
Why are you leaving so soon?
You may know Tom.
He's a grouch.
Tom put his pistol under his pillow.
There are more than seven thousand languages in the world.
I didn't mean it.
Tom asked me if I would be home this evening.
Did Tom hurt himself?
Hide the money.
Tom knows Mary better than anyone else.
Tom put a pile of letters on Mary's desk.
"When I talked with him on the phone, he sounded tired."
May I sit next to you?
"I like to watch sports on TV, especially baseball."
I wonder whether or not Tom knows how to speak French.
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
Stop deluding yourself.
What am I going to say?
The last examination was very difficult.
I need only one cat.
Get back in the house.
What a huge dog!
Don't ever lie to me again.
May I leave this book with you?
When was the first time you came here?
I know who killed the police inspector.
Guess whose middle name is Tom.
You don't have to be sarcastic.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
Are they here?
Tom is a little moody today.
Tom often dreams of his girlfriend.
Tom and Mary aren't busy.
Was that your question?
"I grabbed my little sister's hand, and the two of us started to run."
Have another.
I can't make heads or tails of this.
Please remember to mail the letters.
What happens when an unstoppable force hits an unmovable object?
It's going fine.
Is it easy to get there?
A nod is a sign of agreement.
He went so far as to call her a fool.
This movie is one of my all-time favorites.
What are you doing tomorrow?
This water is good to drink.
A truck hit the dog.
He gave me a watch.
"First, you have to stop smoking."
What'll Tom win?
Tom gave a big yawn.
Some things are perhaps not worth translating.
Thank you for doing me this favor.
She banged the table with her fist.
I didn't lie to Tom.
This is the same watch that I lost.
You could have come to me.
I especially liked the way you sang the second song.
That's life.
She was supposed to call him at 2:30.
Tom isn't my brother.
Do you think that you would enjoy being famous?
They loved you.
I told Tom I forgave him.
There was a detour on the road.
You should think about your future.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Is Tom doing okay?
This newspaper is free.
I speak from experience.
I live in an apartment.
Tom ignored Mary's warning.
She thanked him for his help.
She slowly closed her eyes.
This factory produces CD players.
Tom came to Boston in 2001 and lived here until 2010.
Tom said that it might be true.
Do you want to see me again?
Yours is over there.
Can I turn on the radio?
I have three times as much money as you.
The difference in their ages is six years.
Maybe we should wait till everyone gets here before we start.
I don't want to say that to Tom.
Don't bother Tom.
It's not at all easy.
Such a plan is bound to fail.
I think it's OK.
Many people act like that.
Tom can't see you.
Have you discussed this with Tom?
The President had the power to save the men from execution at the stroke of a pen.
It was a perfect fit.
Tom is an angel.
The ticket is valid for a week.
He can swim.
"If I were rich, I'd go abroad."
How is it?
Do you still love him?
Tom will probably like this game.
"He invested 500,000 yen in stocks."
He confessed all his sins.
Tom reached for his sword.
He was very insistent.
"Unfortunately, you won't get anything done in that office unless you grease someone's palm."
I'm afraid you'll have to go in person.
I bought a pair of boots.
I have two nieces.
How did Tom lose so much weight so quickly?
It wouldn't hurt.
This book seemed interesting.
I'm satisfied with my salary.
We all have things we don't want to tell others about.
We usually speak to each other in French.
I'm the black sheep of the family.
I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
I bet ten dollars on that horse.
It was the bad weather that caused his illness.
"You don't know Tom, do you?"
Tom is still waiting for you.
How long have you had this rash?
Tom isn't here yet.
When was the last time you took the subway?
Kissing Tom was a mistake.
Stir the soup.
Have you written to Tom?
Could I change rooms?
She made him happy.
"Are you interested in baseball, Tom?"
Tom is fine.
Who likes insects?
You don't seem to be very happy.
I told you Tom would help us out.
Speak up!
"Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you."
Make sure you tell Tom.
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.
It's extremely ugly.
Don't talk to your mother like that!
I can't help you with this.
This is a present for you.
Tom looks undecided.
"In my opinion, it's better to change the policy."
The color green is often associated with money.
Tom can't believe Mary let herself get caught.
She went inside.
My explanation was not sufficient.
Tom might hear you.
Tom doesn't understand what's going on.
Who did Tom say broke into his house?
He walked through the forest.
"Both Tom and Mary have Boston addresses, even though they don't live there now."
You were in danger.
He put on the red jacket.
The resolution to the problem was close at hand.
I could barely speak French three years ago.
Tom has high cheekbones.
I didn't want to come here.
Tom ended in second place.
How were you able to escape from prison?
I ran to my mother.
It's been ages since we last met.
I can't stand raw fish.
It could happen to anybody.
The snow lasted for two days.
The situation worries me very much.
Go inside.
Tom would've been very proud of you.
Are you sure you're feeling OK?
Tom is nervous.
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?
Why didn't you call me earlier?
Logical thinking is not my strength.
I'm doing great.
I like to learn ancient languages.
We voted for the candidate.
Look what I made for Tom.
Tom just smiled.
They were right.
What did you have for supper last night?
Have you made plans for next weekend?
Please make sure that the door is locked.
Take a look around you.
I'd like to stay here overnight.
We'd both really like to go to your party.
Tom and Mary are older than John.
"Just go in and tell the boss you want a raise. ""That's easier said than done."""
What are you doing to me?
The Champ du Feu was covered in snow.
He is selfish and greedy.
I acknowledge my mistake.
Please turn off the light when you leave the room.
When are you coming back to the office?
I don't have a lot of money.
It's five o'clock.
Tom has won three races in a row.
It's every man for himself.
You shouldn't have brought Tom with you.
He gave me his word.
It's no use complaining.
Both boys and girls should take cooking class in school.
I hope that's satisfactory.
Shut the book.
One thing I don't like about the iPad is that you can't easily install apps that aren't available through Apple's App Store.
It's not enough.
Tom quickly realized that he was different from the other children.
Tom had the gall to ignore my advice.
Tom is dusting.
Did you write this book?
We got up early so that we could see the sunrise.
I've got to get back to Boston.
Do you have anything non-alcoholic?
What hat do you like?
Watch out for cars when you cross the street.
I just want a little more variety in my life.
Let's take a short break.
It's getting dark. Please turn the light on for me.
Today you can eat as much as you want.
I don't know what'll happen.
Tom didn't know where the money came from.
Will you buy for me some saffron?
"If you are hungry, why don't you eat?"
I've got bad news for you.
I wrote a poem in memory of my dad.
Come downstairs.
It's because I was asked to come that I'm here.
We're here to have fun.
Why are you guys so angry?
He is a heroin addict.
We stood at the door and waited.
"Which do you prefer, spring or autumn?"
"Tom was hungry, so he asked Mary to cook something."
What are you trying to say?
How far is it from here to the next village?
Tom died unexpectedly.
Tom couldn't take the pain any longer.
You're unkind.
I had to work on an essay.
The lack of money is the root of all evil.
I am baffled.
The last time I spoke to Tom was last Monday.
Do you like dogs?
He is constantly complaining.
She has two cats. One is white and the other one is black.
What's the best way to get in touch with you?
Anything the group decides is OK is fine with me.
Even I can't believe that.
You look fabulous.
Do you have any more questions?
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.
He didn't care about going to Heaven.
How old are the kids?
Tom is exactly the sort of guy Mary wants to hang out with.
To prevent the disease from spreading quickly was not an easy task.
Why won't my dog eat dog food?
Tom didn't want to do it.
I wish there were more people like you.
Tom has lots of things he has to do.
I wonder whether Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I am not coming today.
It has had no effect on him.
Why didn't Tom warn us?
"What's Tom doing now? ""You don't want to know."""
I heard her singing a song.
He took me to the park yesterday.
This club is for members only.
It's Monday today.
That sounds funny to me.
I really miss you.
The bridge is under construction.
They can't stop me.
They are both good.
Wild animals live in the jungle.
There's still some cream in the fridge.
It'll all be over soon.
I'm so tired that I'm going to bed as soon as I get home.
Nobody cares what you think.
I took off my hat and entered the church.
The train was full of passengers.
I'm half Japanese.
A highly skilled shearer can shear a sheep in two to three minutes depending on the size and condition of the sheep.
"You're not going to walk, are you?"
He is leaving in three days.
We will be living here next month.
Tom has been a teacher for thirty years.
I thought that I was alone.
The fire went out.
Tom tried to save me.
They have lived here for ten years.
I see no reason not to.
The streets were decorated with flags.
They were surprised by what they saw.
Don't give up on me.
Do you know how to speak French?
Tom is the cutest boy in the class.
I want to ask you something.
The girl has a scarf around her neck.
We will be studying at the University of San Francisco in September.
I'd rather take a taxi than walk.
Does Tom know how to do that?
I told him about our school.
I only know that Tom isn't happy.
May I borrow that book from you?
I'm all out of money.
Are we ready for it?
These shoes belong to me.
Tom is dreaming.
Do you happen to know where Tom lives?
I got even with him.
The worst thing about winter is the snow.
No other casualties have been reported.
I think you're very cute.
"When summer is over, the days grow shorter and shorter."
This policy is sure to go a long way towards stimulating business.
You're too young to remember the nineties.
Flying kites can be dangerous.
I thought maybe you could tell me what I need to know.
Why is she angry?
It is not his business.
This is the worst thing I've ever done.
Which is the best solution?
Change the subject.
I'd rather do this without your help.
All our efforts were in vain.
Are you taking the train?
Tom used the new knife Mary had given him to cut the vegetables.
I saw the pictures Tom took last weekend.
She kissed me on the cheek and said goodnight.
They are running now.
We can't believe anything Tom says about Mary.
It wasn't easy for him to keep his promise.
It's very alarming.
Red circles on the map mark schools.
"Give me your opinion, please."
The seat of my pants is torn.
You can stay at my house.
You should have listened to me.
It's been a long week.
Tom knew everyone.
The cat ruined my sofa.
Is it true that nobody lives around here?
I don't want Tom to help me.
I haven't had the honor of meeting him.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
She really needs your help.
Stay cool.
"Her library has 3,500 books and includes many first editions."
She is always smiling.
The money disappeared.
Tom's reply was evasive.
I have a discharge from my left ear.
"Last night, I listened to radio."
The problem's been solved.
I can explain it to you if you let me.
He walked so fast that she couldn't keep up with him.
I'm going to take good care of you.
The German course begins October fifth.
That man is Tom.
I don't want to end up in jail.
We arrested Tom.
The textbook shows the meaning of each individual word with a picture.
We play soccer every Saturday.
I think he's lying.
Mary wanted to finish making breakfast before Tom woke up.
Is it possible to determine the diameter from the circumference?
You have to wake up early tomorrow morning.
This is the house I grew up in.
Tom thinks you're cute.
I like sweets.
That intrigued everybody.
"Tom, what would you like to have for dinner?"
Didn't Tom smile?
He threatened to make it public.
You should have consulted me first.
Tom passed out from the pain.
Tom is wasting time.
You are entirely correct.
Would you please mail this letter by airmail?
Tom just wanted to get rid of me.
Let's put it to a vote.
I have a Japanese car.
I lost my camera the other day.
Tom is the father of the bride.
Tom came with me.
The boy mocked his friend for being a coward.
The meeting lasted until 5.
I want to eat it.
Have any of you read that book?
The lighting is poor in this part of the city.
They have gone to Europe.
I haven't been out for ages.
We ran out of gas.
The girls giggled.
I was helping Tom.
You should be proud of what you've accomplished.
Tom is extremely lucky.
I like you just the way you are.
"When I opened the refrigerator, I noticed the meat had spoiled."
He refused the food with disgust.
We should've stayed home with Tom.
"If someone paid you to kill Tom, would you?"
You don't need to look for it anymore.
We'll soon be leaving.
He approached the door.
Where's the pan lid?
He is always reading.
"Funny, I don't remember that."
I was starting to think you'd forgotten.
I wish you'd stop doing that.
"Say ""aah."""
I would like to become a top model and travel all over the world.
The officer asked to see Tom's driver's license.
I love to dance.
A terrible thing has happened.
I think they'll understand.
It's not unusual for Tom to be late.
Money doesn't necessarily make you happier.
I'm worried about Tom.
Tom never bothered me again after that.
I'd say no if I were you.
You don't need to explain it to me. I already understand it.
Tom tried to kiss me.
I remember the house where I grew up.
Tom hates opera.
Don't do that anymore.
"The boy fainted, but he came to when we threw water on his face."
I know the man you came with.
What's it made of?
I used to live close to Tom.
I'm very conservative.
Tom can reach me at this number any time of day.
The auto industry is hiring again.
Tom is hardly ever at home.
Why are you telling me that Tom has a girlfriend?
I helped him walk across the street.
Tom isn't nasty.
Gradually the true meaning of what he said began to dawn on me.
Open your eyes.
I have very few books in English.
I need three copies of this letter.
Overfishing is a major problem.
"Having been convicted of murder, he was sentenced to life imprisonment."
Tom asked Mary why John was so unhappy.
He was lying on the bed.
This is a picture.
Tom and Mary loved each other.
I know you think this is crazy.
I can't exclude it.
We'll do it the same way we did it last time.
Tom gave us everything he had.
You idiot!
I don't believe you can do it.
Tom slowly walked up the stairs.
I had a terrible accident riding this bike.
It's pretty simple.
Sorry for being late.
Tom began to suspect that Mary was cheating on him.
I'd never do something like that.
It's not quite as difficult to do as it sounds.
Shall we begin?
That wasn't a mistake.
I'm sorry for having deceived you.
He bribed the judge and got off scot-free.
I shook my head.
Tom stared at Mary for a moment wondering if there was something she wasn't telling him.
He told a funny story.
The hotel where we stayed was very comfortable.
Come back later.
"You're going to wait, right?"
Mary is hoping that Tom will eat lunch with her.
How much money did you spend in total?
Have you ever slipped on a banana peel?
This is an old book.
He asked his teacher for advice.
You are no longer a child.
I'm going to Australia next week with some of my friends.
Do you have any cash?
They even listened to music.
Tom likes crossword puzzles.
He just left.
Tom buttoned his coat.
"My mother speaks French better than my father speaks English, so they usually speak to each other in French."
He goes fishing every other day.
Tom put his wallet on the table.
"Tom makes over $300,000 a year."
Tom caught three fish.
I do like Tom.
Make sure that the dog does not escape.
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house.
The road was obstructed by fallen trees.
They won't be happy until they've taken everything we own.
I have to be back home by seven.
We're short on time.
"I paid 40,000 yen for this tape recorder."
Who are you?
You're the only one for me now.
Don't worry. We're safe here.
I saw Tom.
He permitted them to walk in the garden.
Was Tom annoyed?
He's in grave danger.
I'm not even Canadian.
The soldiers fired.
Who's your favorite actor?
I plan to buy a new car as soon as I can afford one.
You know you can trust me.
This is Tom's camel.
Tom tried to answer the question.
I wish I could paint like that.
The dressing room is over there.
I know Tom wants us to help him.
This statue was erected ten years ago.
Could you talk a little slower?
It'll take you too long.
Tom wasn't serious.
We don't have any sugar.
Leave a message.
I don't know what you want.
I don't like his jokes.

Dozens of young people attended the demonstration.
This is a top secret mission.
I've waited two whole hours. I can't wait any longer.
He came close to losing an eye.
Tom may be in Boston.
Keep an eye on this suitcase.
I know Tom isn't happy here.
I accept your apology.
It's a worrying matter.
I forgot what I was about to say.
Don't they have anyone to look after them?
"Tom, may I speak to you outside?"
Are these all the sizes you have?
He asked my mother.
That doesn't concern me.
He's over forty.
I expect to hear from Tom soon.
Why did Tom lie to Mary?
She was on the point of leaving.
I have traveled all over Australia.
Why do I need to learn this stuff?
That's exactly what we need.
Tom was my closest friend.
I've always hated you.
Tom wanted to be the first to shake hands with Mary after her concert.
How long have you been in Kushiro?
I still have things stored in Tom's garage.
The population of Tokyo is about five times as large as that of our city.

He earns twenty dollars a day.
I'm being criticized for not doing more.
Try not to think about it.
Tom is a university student.
We found the stolen bag in this bush.
I want to be alone for a while.
We agree.
Tom is the kind of guy who likes to try new things.
She came out on top.
Why did you come here today?
"Fully booked for the night, the hotel had to turn away some late guests."
I was told you were the one who helped Tom build his house.
I have gambling debts.
Did you take Tom's advice?
I prefer walking to cycling.
He is far from rich.
She decided on the red coat.
"In case of fire, call 119."
I'm pretty sure Tom is telling the truth.
It was his bicycle that was stolen.
Tom used a toothpick.
How familiar are you with my case?

Please bring me a chair from the next room.
They hired someone else for the job.
You're prettier than me.
I've made a decision.
What do you feed your dog?
I'm sure you've met Tom.
"If you want to be alone, I'll leave."
We've met a few times before.
Tom ate a piece of the cake that Mary baked.
"When I hear that song, I think about when I was young."
Tom is in his room now.
Leave that to me.
I thanked Mary for her help.
I think you've got the flu.
He earns his living by teaching.
That's my lunch.
Our team lost all its games.
I want to buy this material for a new dress. How much does it cost?
Don't disappoint me now.
Keep an eye on him.
We are from France.
He is what you might call a bookworm.
Please take care of my baby while I am out.
Beef is expensive nowadays.
I'll ask around.
This is just my personal opinion.
"If time permits, I'll visit the museum."
He telephoned me again and again.
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens.
Introduce me to your friend over there.
My hairline is receding.
He is a psychic.
His wife kicked him out of the house.
I've known Tom for quite some time.
I'm standing.
That's for you to decide.
I'm sorry for what I've done.
He started taking salsa lessons.
Will you accompany me?
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
My brother goes to the same school I do.

I've got nothing.
That's particularly alarming.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
Shaving doesn't make your beard grow faster.
I don't get paid much.
Tom was lying unconscious on the floor.
I like Korean cuisine.
Who kissed Tom?
She's rather good.
I'm just under 150 centimeters tall.
"If I were you, I'd ask him."
I'm not the only one who got here early.
I don't play tennis after school.
I promised your father I'd look after you.
You're better than I am.
Can I bring you anything else?
Did that answer your question?
I take care of my grandfather.
You don't follow the rules.
They don't need to do it right away.
You need to focus on your strengths.
I've lost.
Don't leave me alone.
Is it true that you've never played poker before?
Tom said that he thought that education was important.
Tom looks dejected.
I made use of every opportunity to improve my English.
The bar where Tom works lost its license because they had been selling alcoholic drinks to minors.
"Your mother is very young, isn't she?"
I'm fine.
What's your relationship with Tom?
I wasn't allowed to help Tom.
I won't dance.
Tom finished off the soup.
The car stereo doesn't work.
Tom hasn't been on speaking terms with Mary for years.
I'm glad you accepted my offer.
Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't like him.
Tom took his headphones off.
"Whatever happens, you're never going to find out."
Do you play any instruments?
How's the world treating you?
Nobody wants you to do this.
"Some people consider it a waste of time to study languages such as Klingon, Interlingua and Esperanto."

Call them this evening.
We can not agree with you on this point.
I'm glad I was able to help you last week.

We have four seasons in Japan.
Have you ever noticed this before?
I'd never do that to you.
I can't hear what they're saying.
Don't underestimate Tom.
Do they take care of the dog?
I'm taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.
Tom is getting good at that.
That didn't help us.
There's no urgency.
You don't have to go to the party unless you want to.
What does your sister do now?
I'm not afraid of the future.
Why did you turn down his request for a pay raise?
Did you write down Tom's number?
Tom caught up with Mary.
That's the snag.
He got injured in a traffic accident.
Is this enough money?
He is waiting for a telephone call.
I swear I didn't see anything.
"Are these yours, Tom?"
Tom didn't know where to put his umbrella.
Tom isn't hungry.
Who is the gentleman all dressed in black?
We will get to Tokyo Station at noon.
Tom doesn't know how to reply.
The motion was carried unanimously.
Is something wrong with the helicopter?
It can't be that bad.
There it is!
The streetcar was packed.
That's Tom's.
I can survive alone.
I'm going to be late for the meeting.
Tom raised the crowbar intending to smash his attacker's head.
My brother is good at playing tennis.
What's Tom got against me?
Her composition is very good except for two or three spelling errors.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
I can't buy a bike.
We're young.
Could you please be quiet?
Are you in a bad mood?
We'll do whatever it takes to complete the project on time.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
"Can I see, too?"
The price is kind of high for a used car.
Tom always tries to set a good example for his children.
I should've warned you.
I don't feel like working today.
You can leave the room now.
"Sorry, I made a mistake."
She became a great artist.
He wants to learn some English songs.
The teacher emphasized the importance of education.
He went out to eat.
Call the FBI.
I'm going to rip up this piece of paper.
I guess now you know how Tom must've felt.
Tom never goes anywhere by himself.
Take things a little more seriously.
She cried.
Now I understand.
I don't have one.
Who is she?
Wait. I can't walk that fast.
Tom and Mary have to paint their car.
You really are hopeless.
Have you ever found a four-leaf clover?
Tom deserves to know what happened.
We all thought that Tom had escaped.
This car is older than I am.
I want to pick out a present for my friend.
This bag is not small.
Radio is a great invention.
What's the secret ingredient?
Don't let him hit his sister.
Tom still calls me from time to time.
It's not a good idea to date your neighbor.
That doesn't make sense at all.
We're always hungry.
"To our disappointment, our team lost the game."
Do you know Tom's parents?
A cold spell gripped Europe.
Did you ever call Tom?
Tom asked Mary to give him a ride to the amusement park.
What's your favorite hot drink?
Fortune smiled on him.
You can smoke here.
It's unlikely that he'll want to get involved.
Everybody laughed at the boy.
We don't live here.
Why don't you stay with me for a few days?
The baby was sound asleep in her mother's arms.
See to it that this never happens again.
I feel protected.
It's redundant.
She used to drink beer.
New York is worth visiting.
Keep the secret.
Nobody remembers.
He was hanged for murder.
Those are too big.
He ordered them to release the prisoners.
I think Tom and Mary are both lying.
Have you heard about the accident?
You missed your chance.
Tom is staying.
"She was a strong, fast runner then."
It was hard to resist the impulse to wring Tom's neck.
His head ached.
That's not acceptable.
We finally got rid of our old car.
Tom is never in a hurry.
I'm tired of reading.
Tom almost died of embarrassment.
I don't think it's a good decision.
I brought you some cookies.
Don't you feel anything?
Our allies are weak.
I lost the book you lent me.
Tom is good at avoiding fights.
Most of the victims were small children.
The traffic was backed up for miles.
A gentleman would never do something like that.
Do Tom and Mary know why you're here?
He speaks Chinese very well.
"Like a house of cards, Tom's dreams and plans came crashing down around him."
Where do you see the books?
Cuff him.
They were satisfied with the result.
I haven't been outside in weeks.
I threw up.
Tom pretended like it never happened.
What's the best way to get there?
The two enemies were face to face.
We can't talk now.
Let's go that way.
What do you want from me?
I like news programs on TV.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life in prison?
The leaves fell to the ground.
Just say whatever you want to say.
The train seems to be late.
Isn't it true that you visited her on the night in question?
We play baseball.
How many cups of tea do you drink a day?
I was present at school yesterday.
I'm surprised Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
I was a witness.
He failed the exam.
Mary asked her son to behave himself.
You cannot substitute money for health.
You don't need to know how it works.
I left my umbrella in the cab.
It's a very serious question.
Does Tom like you?
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary planned on doing.
My mother goes to the market every day to buy things.
She did not keep her promise to write to me.
She did not turn up after all.
Tom was heartbroken when Mary broke up with him.
I usually get up at six.
I have had a slight fever since this morning.
Tom got here by bicycle.
That is the house where he lives.
Tom knows people.
Tom just wanted to have fun.
Tom fell off his horse.
That's utter nonsense.
I'm sure I'll be able to find it.
I am reading a book now.
I'm free.
It's poison.
I think I have a broken rib.
Tom might faint.
It was dark and cold in the room.
I still can't dance.
The battalion surrendered to the enemy.
Have you finished yet?
I didn't complain about anything.
Wealthy older men often marry younger trophy wives.
It was a divine intervention.
"You miss Tom, don't you?"
What I told you yesterday wasn't true.
"In case of fire, push the button."
I do all the work.
He behaved like a child.
"Judging from the expression on her face, she was worried."
I have hives.
Wait here for me.
"How do you say ""kaisha"" in English?"
Do you have a similar proverb in French?
Tom lives near me.
Tom is the one who told me about it.
Can you recommend a hotel near the airport?
I've lived in Boston.
I have some free time right now.
That's all I can do.
Fantastic!
"Don't worry about it, OK?"
Have you tried it before?
Tom made up his mind to become a newspaperman.
We've got another three days.
I'll go tell Tom we're ready.
Look on the bright side.
I'm glad Tom isn't here.
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
"You don't really care, do you?"
It happened just the other day.
Tom was misbehaving.
Tom is finishing his work.
He tore his ligament.
"Hang on, Tom, it won't be long now."
You have to change planes in Boston.
"She promised that she would pay me this week, but she didn't keep her word."
I like playing baseball.
I'd like to talk to you.
It was worth a try.
I can't do it.
I'm a hero.
We'd like to know about it.
We have been studying English for three years now.
How many times have you done that before?
He had been there for ten years before he came to Kyoto.
He has two daughters.
Let me congratulate you on your marriage.
Let's try!
The scandal hurt the company's reputation.
That's why I'm going.
Tom isn't sure what to do.
The heat is almost unbearable.
He hanged himself.
The club members assembled in the meeting room.
I still have to run errands.
Tom says he's never done that.
Go back to your seat.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You should not go alone.
He was born in Ohio.
Tom is going to watch.
Be quiet for a moment.
The water is hot.
Do you like French cuisine?
Do we have to watch this?
"Hey guys, it's getting late."
How's your job going?
I don't know how old Tom is.
Tom wondered how his ex-wife and her new husband were getting along.
Did Tom eat?
Tom isn't afraid of you.
I strolled along the streets to kill time.
How many apples do you want?
"At last, I completed my work."
What animal would you compare yourself to?
Tom hasn't eaten anything all day.
That could be dangerous.
Tom is in no hurry to sell his car.
It's still possible.
His condition is critical.
Tom doesn't mince words.
Tom always orders the same thing.
We expect that to happen.
My fingers are so cold they have gone numb.
There were not many women doctors in those days.
Think happy thoughts.
"You're wearing the ring Tom gave you, aren't you?"
I already have a girlfriend.
Tom told me that Mary quit smoking.
Why didn't you use a pay phone?
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
Tom says he doesn't like doing that.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Tom didn't have any brothers or sisters.
We drink our tea with sugar.
My book bag is very heavy.
Tom was the first one to enter the house.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't want to talk to you.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
You're always busy.
He returned to Japan after graduating from college.
I made friends with him.
You've got each other.
Tom wants to know where you've been.
I still need to eat breakfast.
Have I kept you waiting long?
What exactly is your concern?
I asked you not to play with that.
Tom found Mary's constant criticism of him hard to cope with.
I'm allowing you to go.
Nobody was helping us.
The fence is painted green.
Do you have any evidence to prove him guilty?
I want the fan.
I didn't find any jokes in this book.
I managed to make the teacher understand my idea.
We've been much busier than we expected to be.
I'll never understand you.
"You've never been married, have you?"
Mother bought us a puppy.
I was caught in a shower on my way home.
What is the cause of the fire?
"You want to go to Boston with Tom, don't you?"
We have no need for assistance.
Can we not talk about this just now?
How many people are on your team?
We are Australians.
It's practically impossible not to use baby talk when talking to a young child.
You're blushing like a schoolgirl.
Can I ask why not?
You should have a light on.
I've written his address on the back of the envelope.
I'm the youngest in the family.
"I don't know who I'll miss more, you or your brother."
The elevator is out of order today.
"Which do you like better, white wine or red wine?"
They're very happy.
Do you want to spend the next ten years in prison?
So what're you saying?
Tom couldn't believe what Mary said.
Do I look fat?
I know how much you care about Tom.
"You think you have to do that today, don't you?"
It's all over.
He got what he wanted.
The radio died.
What do they do?
Do you know Tom well?
Is Tom drunk?
I didn't think of that.
I'm a truck driver.
Tom ate his breakfast quietly.
What did you hope to accomplish?
I slipped and fell on the icy sidewalk.
That's not my name.
Where did she go yesterday?
It'll soon be October.
I got here as fast as I could.
Did Tom enjoy it?
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
Please lend me your book.
I'm a night owl.
I have to brush my teeth.
You must get rid of the habit of biting your nails.
Tom is radical.
Huh? How is that relevant?
How am I supposed to eat?
The seats are all sold out.
She advised him that he should stay at home.
I have plenty of money with me.
Tom hasn't been able to go to school for three weeks.
Tom lives alone in the woods.
Feed a cold and starve a fever.
The man ran away.
Tom made pancakes for all of us.
I hope no one followed you.
I'm as healthy as a horse.
That's great!
It doesn't make sense to me.
I have to finish packing.
I wish I could go to the party with you.
The victim was stabbed repeatedly by the killer.
Perhaps Tom and Mary should travel together.
It's just one of those things.
I'm going to get ready for bed.
How many cigarettes am I allowed to take back duty free?
Tom chickened out.
The picnic was held in the gym on account of the rain.
We don't have to watch this.
I must go now.
I told the police everything I know.
Do you need a lift?
Who's the fastest one here?
Can you give me the recipe?
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
I really need your help.
Tom poured me a cup of tea.
Tom wasn't wet.
Is it convenient for you if I come at 5 p.m.?
Will you warm up the soup?
Tom wondered how much Mary weighed.
I'd like to meet Tom someday.
I saw the film and found it interesting.
Tom seemed hungry.
"If you don't study, you won't pass the exam."
"Tom retired on October 20, 2013."
Please give me another chance.
Tom doesn't have a good French-English dictionary.
Do you like any of these pictures?
Tom and Mary looked embarrassed when John caught them kissing.
"Like it or not, you have to go."
They're tears of joy.
Do you have a mobile phone?
I don't know you.
What are you doing up there?
Tom said he didn't want to study French.
This could take hours.
My cholesterol levels are high.
Everything is all right now.
The apple tree has a beautiful blossom.
I am reading a play.
Tom didn't meet Mary or anyone else.
I'm not the same fool I was fifteen years ago.
Tom's family is in Australia.
I finally found a home.
I moved to Boston last spring.
My French is still not very good.
Do you have a bike?
Are you courageous?
Tom is a personal friend.
I can't ever be with you.
Is this OK with you?
"He was a big, heavy man."
I couldn't stand Tom at first.
I'm a normal girl.
That would be lying.
Tom slammed down the phone.
You have to come.
"Apparently, everyone was happy."
I'd like you to read this book.
Wait for me in the meeting room.
Tom's concert was actually pretty boring.
Tom is arriving soon. You should get ready.
I bought it in a thrift store.
You should have attended the meeting.
I like your frankness.
Tom is the tallest in our class.
No one was watching.
He would rather go by train than by plane.
A man must be honest.
Tom knows everything there is to know about cars.
What's that smell?
He feels very happy.
Why is Tom home?
"I am being paranoid, aren't I?"
Tom will always be here for you.
You have to answer this question.
Tom says that he's never lied to Mary.
I'm not angry!
May I eat another piece of cake?
What is in this box?
I watch a lot of gangster movies.
Where did you get your camera repaired?
I don't know where Tom is from.
I'm glad you asked me for advice.
It would take forever to explain everything.
We talked about basketball.
The child cried for help.
Tom is unfazed.
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.
Tom could see that a potentially dangerous situation could arise.
Tom rode the roller coaster.
Tom doesn't know what time it is.
"I have a lot to do today, so if you don't mind, I'd like to have this discussion at another time."
Look out for pickpockets.
The company wants to employ 20 people.
I can't walk.
Japan does a lot of trade with the USA.
I haven't heard from him since then.
How many more forks do we need?
I hear you passed the entrance exam. Congratulations!
Did you put Tom up to it?
She doesn't need to go there herself.
Did you enjoy your holiday?
My sister is also my best friend.
Only Tom and Mary were at home.
Can you recommend a hotel?
I'm getting good at this.
Where does Tom have to do that?
I'm sorry for what I did.
He will notice sooner or later.
"Two glasses of apple juice, please."
I want to eat pizza.
It is warm there all the year round.
I read your letter yesterday.
"Where are my glasses? ""Where you left them."""
I'll let you know beforehand.
He worked hard.
Tom is always on my mind.
Tom recommended me.
What's Tom good at?
Tom sells shoes.
We don't need you.
Tom walked back into the house.
I'll move soon.
You're in the way.
I don't know what to do for dinner.
Both Tom and Mary cut themselves on some broken glass.
Which is the most populated continent in the world?
Please step aside.
You didn't have to do that.
Tom doesn't know where Mary has gone.
It's clear that he stole money from the safe.
He couldn't fulfill the promise he made to his father.
My grandparents were born in the last century.
Let's begin with Lesson 3.
Could you pass me the salt?
Look at that.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand."
Tom won't leave if you don't want him to.
I already know how to dance.
Adults are welcome to participate.
He earns a living.
Do you want my opinion?
He was a little old man with thick glasses.
She loves cats.
Guess what happened to me.
Tom never goes to sleep before midnight.
Tom shouldn't wait for Mary for more than ten minutes.
"Suppose your father saw us together, what would he say?"
"He can speak Russian, too."
Can you give my brother a job?
The car broke down five miles outside of town.
We acknowledge receipt of your letter.
None of the girls is a student.
Just because you're my girlfriend doesn't mean I have to agree with you.
You look very pale.
Tom attended Mary's graduation ceremony.
Mary could be a model.
What does that have to do with you?
Can you really predict the future?
My blood pressure is low.
"These stairs are a little slippery, so please be careful."
This coat looks loose on me.
We all hope that this cease-fire will make for world peace.
He helped me do my homework.
I don't know who you are.
"Even with all the money he has, he isn't happy."
What are the two of you doing?
I think it'll freeze tonight.
That's just what I wanted.
This would've been your room if you'd decided to stay with us.
The train came on time.
I think she is over forty years old.
"I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came."
He has a heart condition.
You don't get paid to think.
It's more difficult than you think.
What does this say?
Are you dead?
Old people wake up early.
Tom hasn't cooked the eggs yet.
Tom wants to donate money.
You'll never guess what I found.
I'd like to see that in black and white.
They were left to fend for themselves.
How did you get acquainted with her?
Everything I told you is the truth.
Keep singing.
I don't get bored alone at home.
Do not do that.
Tom will find something.
It's difficult for me to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
I was told that you might be able to help me.
Sometimes I still miss her.
"After you've eaten, you should get some sleep."
Tom heard a noise behind him and turned around to see what it was.
I would never betray you.
Miniskirts have gone out of fashion.
"Two tickets, please."
They love us.
Tom has just told me that he found a new job.
My dog sleeps in the same room that I do.
Prepare to die.
Give it to me!
Tom wants to kill Mary.
We may never know what happened to Tom.
What have you learned about Tom so far?
The customer is always right.
We had to stop.
Tom is home now.
What's in that cupboard?
These girls are in trouble.
I'm a great baseball fan.
I have a theory.
"If you change your mind, let us know."
Tom can't retire.
I keep my hammer in the toolbox.
Come and dance with me.
I like white wine better than red wine.
I hold you responsible for this incident.
That day shall come.
Tom also likes horse racing.
The cold froze the water in the pipes.
You must be crazy.
Tom blew his top when he heard that Mary had gone out with John.
You've abused my trust.
I don't think Tom would try to do that without our help.
Tom hit the target.
You and I are old friends.
Tom's a lot smarter than people give him credit for.
I have to go to Boston.
All the windows were open.
"Although we don't have much money, I want to buy this painting."
Tom never wears a tie.
It was a perfect day for a wedding.
Should I really do it?
"Do your best, and you will succeed."
I have not heard from him for a long time.
I said what had to be said.
Let's try to reason with them.
Did you make it?
Please come inside.
Ask Tom to apologize to Mary.
She bought a handkerchief for ten dollars.
How did you know I like Tom?
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
Tom put some flowers on the table.
"He's a crybaby, just like always."
The glass dropped from his hand.
Is there a service charge for that?
I don't have a computer at home.
I'm really mad at Tom right now.
We need to teach Tom a lesson.
I'm looking for books on Roman history.
What's wrong with your eyes.
A person with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds.
He called her every other day.
"If it happens again, we want to be ready."
You did what you had to do.
I haven't got it yet.
How can I help you?
I need to go to the hospital.
I don't care what you think anymore.
What does Tom know about me?
"If you don't know, who does?"
Tom really enjoys his job.
Tom is likely to end up in prison if he doesn't straighten up.
Would you mind telling me where you're going?
I feel like going on a trip.
The light bulb has burned out.
I was the one who said we should wait.
She takes care of many elderly people.
I'd like to thank you for accepting my invitation.
Tom lost his way in the woods.
Can you please tell me how I can get to the beach?
I expected a little privacy.
Everyone should exercise their right to vote.
We can't even be sure Tom is in Boston.
The defendant has no prior convictions.
Tom must be a very important person.
Tell everybody.
Tom says he'll come.
Mary hasn't painted her room yet.
Tom is reluctant.
Do snakes scare you?
Tom won't talk.
Tom is a good driver.
Let's start the ball rolling by introducing ourselves.
Did you grade the tests?
Tom looked upset.
Let's go out for a walk.
Tom told me he speaks French.
We have no chance against those top players.
Whose is all this money?
Tom missed the last train and spent the night at an Internet cafe.
I want very much for you to understand.
Tom said you were too busy to talk to us.
You're starting to get really annoying.
Who will look after the baby while they're out?
Tom handed Mary the green notebook.
"Being very tired, I went to bed early."
Tom said he knew Mary.
Tom has already drunk three cups of coffee.
We have no choice but to fight.
Tom took a step backward.
How long have you been here in Boston?
That man was a wretch.
Is Tom studying French at school?
Please put it aside for me.
Don't tempt me.
I'm not sure if I like this one or that one.
His manners are not those of a gentleman.
I should've listened to Tom.
Tom heard Mary singing in the shower.
Did you yell at Tom?
Tom was the first one to leave work today.
Is Tom one of your friends?
Tom is not going to do it.
How do you like this town?
You're really a good photographer.
Tom unfolded the letter and read it.
How naive do you think I am?
I hate to lose.
It was a camera that she bought there.
Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
You of all people should appreciate that.
I'm going to be there.
Tom laughs at his own jokes.
Will you still be here when I get back?
"Tom, don't die."
We know you're the thief.
Tom reads slowly.
Speaking foreign languages is not easy.
Where do you think you're going dressed like that?
I call her pretty often.
Please say hello to your parents for me.
Someday you should give it a try.
I usually agree with her.
Is that what you want to do?
The house by the lake is mine.
This battery is charged.
Tom submitted a list of topics for possible inclusion on the agenda for the annual general meeting.
Gold is heavier than silver.
People were not prepared for the storm.
It's kind of funny.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
I assume it was unavoidable.
Come and see me soon.
He isn't actually the manager.
"I am five feet, two inches tall."
We were completely exhausted from the five-hour trip.
I appreciated my neighbor's generous offer.
I don't have money.
I sympathize.
We're the only ones here.
She has lived with us since last summer.
Tom asked a question.
I'll go out and buy one as soon as I can.
What is the student population at your college?
I don't like any of these records.
Is someone waiting for you?
Who'll succeed?
You need to try a little harder.
Isn't that childish?
I have a Facebook account.
Tom bought this house thirty years ago.
Even Tom cried.
I paid for it already.
Tom has to look for a job.
I see the boy.
"I was born on April 3, 1950."
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.
Women like Tom.
Tom's house was destroyed by a tornado.
Your suggestion is of no practical use.
The weather report says it will rain tomorrow afternoon.
Tom has nothing better to do right now.
Tom came racing down the stairs.
He said better times were ahead for the country.
I'm not sure when Tom will turn up.
Please show me how to use the headset.
Radishes might be more expensive than the carrots.
I want Tom to do it.
I'll take the bus.
She came three minutes after I called.
Don't expose it to the rain.
I'll take that one.
Everything is all arranged.
"Can we get this over with, please?"
Which shall I begin with?
Come forward.
That's no longer possible.
Can you tell us when this was made?
He was criticized for raising taxes.
Tom said that somebody here needed help.
You could search the world over and never find another man more honest than Tom.
Tom gave Mary his number.
What are they?
Give Tom a call.
I can hear a saxophone playing somewhere.
Revolutions that don't succeed are soon forgotten.
This isn't legal.
That's Tom's mother.
Tom wants to see Mary.
I'm sure you already know what to do.
That town looked prosperous.
I'd rather go to Boston.
I know precisely what you are feeling.
"Tom wasn't looking at Mary, but he was listening to everything she was saying."
"The moment they saw me, they waved."
My name isn't Tom anymore.
Tom always had a lot of money.
I want to study French.
I hate being alone this time of year.
I didn't want to scare you.
Have you ever climbed Mt. Aso?
Tom and Mary saw themselves in the mirror that was hanging on the wall.
Tom is headstrong.
Nobody went there.
I'm pretty sure the first thing you'll want to do when you get to Boston is call home.
I'm also thinking of going to Korea.
Would you like me to help you?
I think we're going to need to put this project on the back burner for a little while.
The old book was moldy.
A whale is a mammal.
It's nothing you need to worry about.
What's your explanation?
Doesn't that sound good?
Cut the melon into six equal pieces.
Who is the girl singing on the stage?
Do you know anyone who hums while they work?
I'm trying to rid myself of this bad habit.
All children do not like apples.
He often tells us we must help one another.
Who have you helped lately?
You will regret this.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I worry too much.
Sometimes you're so irritating.
Replace the old tires with new ones.
I leave it to your imagination.
They believed Tom.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
I've never witnessed so much debauchery in my entire life.
"Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the cost."
Tom has a couple of friends in Australia.
I like English best.
It is in April that our school years start.
Don't punish him for breaking the window. He is not to blame.
I'm listening to Björk's latest song.
What kind of car do you drive?
He's on his last legs.
You are too young to be in love.
They were not speaking Spanish.
I have to do it myself.
His dream came true.
This room is too hot to study in. I can't stand it any more.
Tom was incorrect.
Be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.
They buy vegetables at the supermarket.
Children are playing behind the house.
"The hallway is slippery, so watch your step."
My eyes get tired very easily.
"Would you be so kind as to let me borrow your cell phone, please?"
Where can I rent a furnished room?
He smoked a cigar after lunch.
Your friend's in the other room.
The train was going 500 miles per hour.
Tom and I were married to each other for three years.
You need to keep trying until you get it right.
They don't want us.
He loves going to the theater.
Have you ever drunk carrot juice?
You'll never change.
I feel like an idiot.
I don't want you to scream.
Tom began crying.
How long do you need to stay in Boston?
I don't want to be in your way.
My office is on the fourth floor of that gray six-story building.
Selling cars is my business.
Call me if there's a change.
I believe you like your job.
You'll end up in jail.
I can wait no longer.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
There must be a way we can convince Tom to work for us.
It will be dark soon.
"This one's my room, Tom."
The bus was late because of the traffic jam.
We slept in the same bed.
Mary spends hours in the bathroom.
He's not in our group.
We need some privacy.
I'm happy where I am.
Everyone says that he's a good man.
Everybody jumped.
I'm thinking about something else.
Tom said that he'd pay the bill.
I met her by accident.
The long trip aggravated her injury.
Show me the doll that you bought yesterday.
That thought crossed my mind.
The cat was playing with a live mouse.
I don't speak Japanese.
"Tom asked Mary for a date, but she turned him down."
I work as a teacher.
We've got to save Tom.

Hope to see you again next year.

You're sharp.
I hear that she is a famous actress.
Start writing.
I just need to find out why that happened.

You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
How did you figure that out?
Tom overslept.
I spent the whole day cleaning my house.
That man has a very good build.
That has always been so.
Tom became dizzy from the heat.
Tom is a grouchy old man.
Why do they do this?
"Having heard the story before, she didn't want to hear it again."
Tom has very long hair.
Why are you in your pajamas?
I'm just saying you shouldn't trust Tom.
We did nothing wrong.
"When my father came home, I was studying."
The jewel was stolen during the night.
I must get my watch repaired.
This cat is as big as that one.
Now would be a good time.
I've loved you for a long time.
Tom is an aggressive person.
It's time you faced reality.
Have you ever visited Kyoto?
What made you say such a stupid thing as that?
We don't have all the time in the world.
This isn't for me.
Could you please show me a camera that's cheaper than this one?
I had jeans on.
It was pure chance that he won the game.

Tom visited the Colosseum in Rome.
We're not fighting.
I don't see Tom's car.
Where is my office?
She works for a hospital.
Do you think your spouse spends enough time with you?
I regret not having bought that house.
I couldn't lie to you.
I don't want to be told what to do.
Tom has a tendency to exaggerate.
"Tom took another shot at the crow, but missed again."
Which is your bag?
I'll be done in an hour.
Keep your eyes on Tom. Make sure he doesn't do anything to bother other people.
Tom likes to swim.
The ball rolled across the lawn.
My mom bought me this shirt.
How did you know that would happen?
Tom followed in his father's footsteps.
"You know his name, don't you?"
You made a mistake.
I wish I had been with her then.
Maybe you didn't understand Tom.
When did you hear the sound?
All the students protested against the war.
I'm glad you weren't injured.
We are working in the interest of peace.
I think everything here is under control.
Am I still welcome here?
Tom managed to open the locked door.
Stay together.
Those kinds of methods are out of date.
What does this look like?
My apartment is near the station.
Tom didn't come until 2:30.
He thinks only about himself.
I'm hungover.
That's certainly an interesting question.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
I have to get ready for work.
My dog goes everywhere with me.
Your daughter isn't a girl anymore.
The rope broke when we were climbing the mountain.
I'm sorry I woke you.
I need to find something to open this bottle with.
I'm always meeting him there.
Tom tried to make sure that every employee was treated with respect.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
We can't leave Boston until we finish this job.
That boy won't tell me his name.
Tom seems to prefer spending most of his time alone.
It's getting cold.
Do you have any good news?
Tom must care about you very much.
Africa is the poorest continent.
You're the first person I told that to.
I can't bear this pain.
Why does it take them so long to set up my internet connection?
I could hardly close the suitcase.
You must get to know Tom.
That isn't fair.
When did you begin to learn English?
You've got what it takes to do well in this job.
Tom said you like popcorn.
Nobody answered my question.
We won't be back here again until next year.
Tom seemed fine.
Can I help you?
The police officer shone his flashlight in Tom's face.
He knows how to bet.
I need a driver to take me home.
I want to go to America.
His house isn't far from this store.
Tom turned on the car's fog lights.
This dress is cheaper than yours.
I was bored to death.
I had to walk there because my car broke down.
Do you talk to your plants?
It was the wrong thing to do.
Have you ever been to Africa?
Do you want to risk that?
What's a porcupine?
We'll cooperate.
Where's my mama?
Your instincts were wrong.
It's not worth the money.
What have you learned about Tom?
Tom's swimming.
What would you like for lunch?
Tom would like to know the reason why Mary isn't here.
Tom says he'll do that for Mary.
Tom is watching.
Diamonds are forever.
I wish I could speak English.
What's going on with you?
"A long time ago when I was young, I used to write in my diary every day."
Tom told me not to do it this way.
Tom isn't accustomed to walking barefooted.
That poor lady is disabled.
I don't care what you want.
It's sad.
Blue looks good on you.
Tom is your friend.
Do you know your blood type?
He is rarely in a good mood.
Tom is strange.
Tom was in a hurry this morning.
I've got my friend on the line right now.
He told me to meet him there.
Try to avoid bad company.
You need a joystick.
All of the buses are full.
I want to be in the other group.
Tom hid the book under his pillow.
That was a mediocre movie with mediocre actors.
Tom has big hands.
He introduced his daughter to me.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
"Tom smiled, but didn't respond."
Tom didn't have the courage to say no.
I am not missing the point.
She kept me waiting for over an hour.
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
Could you lend me some money?
You have to audition to join the choir.
My watch gains two minutes a month.
She sang pretty well.
Do you want the job?
He is waiting for a telephone call.
Tom stepped away from the door.
I asked Tom to sing my favorite song.
Please make up your mind.
My grandmother raised a family of ten.
I don't want you to scream.
You're not telling me the whole truth.
I'm going to take you to Tom.
"You're one of them, aren't you?"
He did it out of kindness.
Rome was the largest city in the world at the time.
I can't let you push me around anymore.
Tom doesn't want to go to Boston with me.
He speaks English fluently.
Please repeat after me.
What're you going to do with Tom?
Is everything that belongs to you in that chest?
Where's the nearest bus stop?
We left the movie early.
Do you have paper?
The traffic light turned green.
Tom sort of took me under his wing.
It would be better if you read more books.
I've never seen that man before in my life.
I heard that one way to stay healthy is to avoid eating any food with unpronounceable ingredients.
I wish I'd bought a white dress!
What do you want to ask me?
We'll be home all day tomorrow.
The waitress flirted with Tom thinking that he'd leave her a larger tip.
What ship will you arrive on?
Tom chased after Mary.
Have you read the book yet?
I don't believe half of what I've been told about you.
I love this mobile phone.
A child is spoiled by too much attention.
He and I are teachers.
Norway's population is about 5 million.
The usual business hours in this office are from nine to five.
Please tell me this isn't true.
I can't understand his ideas at all.
"Although natto smells awful, it is delicious."
I tried not to cry.
"Tom couldn't come see us for Christmas, so we went to see him."
The moon was shining brightly.
Would you give me a discount?
I have to finish writing this report by 2:30.
I'll get this.
I found no money left in my pocket.
What made it difficult for you to carry out the plan?
We'll ask Tom.
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can.
I sometimes dream of my mother.
His suggestion is worth considering.
Your father loves you.
Don't ask me to do that.
You're better able to do it than I am.
The prospects for our victory are excellent.
Don't talk!
Have you ever been to America?
"Frankly speaking, your way of thinking is out of date."
Why did you guys break up?
I think about that from time to time.
"While listening to the radio, I fell asleep."
Tom stubbed his toe.
I thought he might come.
We can't stay here. The roof is about to collapse!
I'm sure we have a lot in common.
I found this watch at the station.
Tom blinked.
The next station is where you get off.
They are still children.
Tom doesn't want to study French.
Why were you late?
Why do rabbits have long ears?
You have to take that into account.
I don't trust anyone here.
I'd suggest you don't stay longer than absolutely necessary.
"It cost me 5,000 yen to repair my bicycle."
He fired most of his men.
Did you apologize to Tom?
There is no place like home.
I don't know where you live.
I rode the elevator to the third level.
The Ferris wheel is my favorite.
They had to work all year round.
Who would do this?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I had the brakes of my bicycle adjusted.
The front door was open.
Did Tom seem busy?
I just want a little more coffee.
Could you recommend a nice restaurant near here?
Has Tom really come back?
I drive a convertible.
It makes me very happy.
Tom left his briefcase on his desk.
Does Tom like it there?
This watch is a really good buy.
He loves us.
He went from Tokyo to Osaka by plane.
She pricked herself with a needle while embroidering.
What shall I do with it?
I wish I could remember his name.
I'll be back in half an hour.
He took a step forward.
Why did you say yes if you didn't want to go?
Tom is in Australia.
You're welcome to move back to Boston.
Please take this chart to the X-ray Room on the third floor.
"Hey, you can't leave now."
Tom pondered his next move.
Is it Japanese food?
Don't ever do that again.
Great men are not always wise.
"To tell the truth, I didn't notice it."
One's lifestyle is largely determined by money.
She unburdened herself of her terrible secret.
Tom rented an apartment near his mother's.
Point to the one you mean.
He kissed her.
You're totally right.
I'm on my way.
How much money do I owe you?
The sky was filled with airplanes.
He saves what he earns.
I know you'd never do that intentionally.
We're fighting.
A boat capsized.
He speaks poor French.
I noticed some mistakes in his report.
That does it.
I wasn't able to finish doing that as soon as I thought I'd be able to.
Nobody can help you.
Do you like my friend?
This custom should be done away with.
Tom is dozing.
"If everyone agrees to it, I won't vote against it."
Did Tom give you anything?
Tom was carjacked.
He is my colleague.
Tom is hard at work.
She won't make it.
This is delicious.
Tom gave us everything we needed.
We can't pretend Tom is normal.
Please stay within earshot.
Tom doesn't know what to do first.
Tom is adorable.
He had to work even on Sunday.
My house is haunted.
You've improved your English.
What is the total number of students?
We're so happy for you.
Tom reluctantly went to the dentist.
Tom is training his dog.
"Where is my wife? ""She is in jail."""
How come you aren't taking me?
I would like to meet you.
Do you think there is another answer to this difficult problem?
Tom owns a lot of land just outside of Boston.
Tom likes to hunt.
"When Tom woke up, he found that Mary had disappeared."
The accident took place near that intersection.
The almond trees are in bloom.
Tom has a loud voice.
He was a tall man.
His absence yesterday was due to his cold.
He is the tallest of all boys.
Are you guys hungry?
There still weren't any visible signs of spring.
He made up that story.
Our financial problems are serious.
You have a secret admirer.
Are we alone in the universe?
Tom is smarter than you.
I'm the one who deserves to be promoted.
Tom doesn't like being contradicted.
Please let me know if you find any typos or missing words.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't likely do that.
There was an explosion.
Paper is a Chinese invention.
I'd like to talk to Tom alone.
My studies keep me pretty busy.
I wish Tom would spend more time at home.
I think that he is honest.
He was at home.
Where does she live now?
It's not mine.
I want to tell you about Tom.
Did you take him back to your apartment?
"When I saw his mother yesterday, she said he had left the hospital a week before."
Tom surrendered.
He put the blame upon me.
Tom ditched me.
Take only one.
Mary is my wife.
Tom has a sister who likes to play tennis.
The only true language in the world is a kiss.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really needed to do that.
I'll take that as a yes.
"If I'd wanted your help, I would've asked for it."
I'd like to see my art teacher this afternoon.
I had him carry my bag.
I had hardly fallen asleep when the telephone rang.
Tom is the captain of the football team.
Don't touch my stuff.
They got to be good friends.
I'm touched.
"If you were in my place, what would you do?"
"It's too far to walk to the station, so let's take a bus."
Tom wanted to see Mary's room.
Shall we go now?
She blamed him for all her problems.
Tom decided to quit smoking.
I don't think you're fat.
I made a fist.
My sister's going to kill me.
I can't necessarily agree with you on that point.
This decision was hard.
You're the most important person in my life.
Let me check my schedule.
Hackers break into computers without permission.
"He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever."
I had hardly checked in at the hotel when he called me.
He will provide you with what you need.
Do you know why the sky is blue?
I brought mine. Did you bring yours?
Tom said he'd help Mary.
I've changed my mind.
The person that told me the mall closes at 9:00 p.m. was wrong.
I'm going to be a teacher.
"Well, what happened to her?"
Their talks centered on their trip.
Why don't you give it another try?
I wish Tom was here with me today.
Tom has a beer belly.
I couldn't help but cry.
Please sing.
"After digressing, he returned to the subject."
The ship was flying the American flag.
Tom's tipsy.
"My goodness, what's going on here?"
Tom will suffer.
"Unable to prove his innocence, he was forced to leave his native town."
Is there any milk left?
Every rose has its thorn.
We'll meet Tom in thirty minutes.
She has no one to talk to.
He earns twice as much as me.
He promised to write every day.
Tom almost always ignores my advice.
Did you like this book?
I would be happy to help you.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
Here's the money I borrowed from you.
Do you guys think I'm fat?
I'm glad you like it.
Coffee is Brazil's main product.
She must have seen better days.
I don't look like that.
It's not good to read in a dark room.
Take as much or as little as you'd like.
France is to the south of England.
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
My neighbor is a kleptomaniac.
Love of money is the root of all evil.
It's been a long time since I've heard that song.
How do I fix this problem?
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
Tom found Mary's diary.
He doesn't look happy.
Tom is completely nuts.
They saw me.
I don't like studying in this heat.
I spent my vacation in a foreign country.
You could drive home by yourself.
Obesity is a serious problem.
I need to get a new motorcycle.
Tom loved skiing.
Isn't there anything you want to tell me?
Everything he told us was pure fabrication.
Tom arrived half an hour early.
You have to obey the law.
"Suddenly, Tom cried out in pain."
He was experienced in business.
Do you have any money left?
I took a shower.
Tom bent over to pick up a coin that was on the floor.
The pirates had no choice but to surrender.
Tom ought to stop smoking.
Nobody expected anything from me.
She's just acting disappointed.
You need to stay awake.
"If you want to study in the United States, you need to get a student visa."
Tom was late for work.
Tom majored in political science.
I don't think you should quit your job.
We are spending the night at my uncle's house.
Trying to do such a thing is a waste of time.
Has a solution been found?
The old man spent most of his time looking back on his youth.
I want to use this.
Have you paid your phone bill?
I don't like politics.
It looks like a UFO.
I met your parents yesterday.
He often reads far into the night.
"I don't know, nor do I care."
This is very surprising.
Do you remember when we first met?
My eyes are blue.
We are sick and tired of political corruption.
Tom is doing everything he can to help.
You can always tell what any individual wants most by what he does.
Please leave me alone. I am busy.
They fell.
What happened last week?
Tom is a man of few wants.
"I changed my mind, so I'm not going."

I hid it somewhere.
A beautiful woman like you shouldn't be eating alone.
They flunked their exams.
Mary wants to have a balanced lifestyle.
I'll never do that again.
Can you do this problem?
I'll try again.
School begins at half past eight in the morning.
You must have been surprised to meet me in such a place the other day.
I want you to go upstairs.
You should be thanking me.

There were no railroads.
I don't want to go there again.
This door would not open.

He comes here every three days.
I'll tell you a secret.
Do you like my clothes?
The two books are equivalent in value.

Is that what you're suggesting?
It happened over a year ago.
Tom has had trouble walking ever since he was six years old.
Tom leaned down.
I never thought that Tom would one day become vegetarian.
I changed my mind.
Who did you think it was?
Why should you suspect me?
Have him wait a moment.
Tom is not like that all the time.
See what happens when you tell the truth?
She was fortunate to pass the exam.
She's smart and beautiful.
Tom and Mary would both like that.

Tom is quiet.
Tom and Mary both sounded disappointed.
I think Tom lied to Mary.

Shoot anything that moves.
This always makes me laugh.

Tom is a librarian.
His grades have improved significantly.

There are more important things we should be doing right now.
"It really happened, didn't it?"
I'll be nice.
Tom looks like his father.
"Tom and Mary walked down the hall, side by side."
I understand you met with Tom recently.
Is your family OK?
I'll never get over that.
I'm not happy here.
That is a good idea.
"I'm Japanese, the boy answered."

I'm at a loss for words.

Are you saying you don't know?
He went to London via Paris.

That wind blew out our last candle.
Tom has just proposed to Mary.
His jokes are not funny at all.
Let's play tennis. I've booked a court for 10:30.
They visited me occasionally.
I'm sure that Tom won't mind.
We'll need Tom's help.
I was tired today.

You're making a big mistake.
Tom said that he didn't know French.

"It's nobody's fault, but mine."
I've never told anyone something like that before.
"Tom asked Mary to marry him, but she turned down his proposal."
He deceived his friend.
I heard Tom speak French yesterday for the first time.
I hope I can count on your discretion.
"A samurai, even when he has not eaten, uses a toothpick like a lord."

She's a cutie.
I'd rather live in peaceful poverty than in wealth and fear.

You have the freedom to travel wherever you like.
I'll call you in the evening.
Did you see her there?

I'm tired from lack of sleep.
Who is it that you want to talk to?
Tom left for home well over an hour ago.
Tell Tom I'll be back.
What do you men want?
I tripped over a stone.
This is from Tom.
Did Tom speak French to you?
Language is the most important invention of the man.
Tom and Mary see eye to eye on this.
Tom is good at what he does.
There's something I need to talk with you about.
I don't have anywhere else to go.
Tom doesn't fit in here at all.
That's impossible.
I know what Tom did to you.
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
My home is your home.
Do you feel sorry for Tom?
"Right now, we have blueberries, blackberries, cherries, strawberries, peaches and nectarines."
Don't be so impatient.
Tom was here less than an hour ago.
Let's have a go at it.
This time you must go there.
I was tired and cold.
That's OK with me.
Show me another watch.

I thought it was a joke.
Do you wanna talk?

He is an army officer.
Did you see him go out?
How much rent do you pay?
"Come again tomorrow afternoon, when I will have more time to talk with you."
The war broke out in 1939.
I knew it would never work between Tom and me.
Do we have any French homework that needs to be turned in tomorrow?
Is it love?
French is my favorite subject.
A book came for you in the mail today.
I already said I'm not going.
He reached across the table and shook my hand.
He's almost as tall as me.
Finish your work quickly.
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with him.
Learning a foreign language is interesting.
We'll do it this way from now on.
We cannot thank you enough.
She cut off the carrot tops.
I gave him what little information I had.
Wait up.

Have fun.

Where did you find that strange thing?
What was your major?
Let's start with beer.
Tom was lying unconscious on the operating table.
"Good work, Tom."
Tom will save us.
He was kind enough to take me to the bus stop.
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant.
What else do you want to know?
I requested extra salt on my French fries.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
The police detective said that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
I've lost or broken all my necklaces.
Don't you like us?
Why are you so late?
I'll take care of you.
Tom was able to buy what he needed.
I wish he had attended the meeting.
One of the disadvantages of living alone is that you have no one to talk to.
I can't read her poker face.
Tom started whistling a happy tune.
I think Tom is a little too optimistic.
Did Tom listen to you?
You probably think Mary is cute.
Tom has friends.
You're absolutely wrong.
Tom only wears brand-name clothes.
Let's get drunk.
"I love Tom, but I don't know if he feels the same way."
Everyone is more or less conceited.
How was your trip?

Is she here yet?

The worst riot was in Chicago.
He is not up to the task.
I truly loved her.
Do you really want to wait till Tom shows up?
"If we work as a team, we can achieve anything."
A lot of people are coming out of the movie theater.
Not everyone has access to the Internet.
How long do you think Tom will work for us before he quits and goes to another company?
He satisfied his thirst with a large glass of beer.
Have you ever been inside Tom's house?
Can you watch your brother for a little while?
How did you convince Tom?
I don't have a car anymore.
I hate to contradict you.
Have you written your report?
I asked her to send us the book.
I don't feel up to running to the station.
"Let's play tennis. ""Yes let's."""
I'm an officer.
I can't remember how I got home last night.
I don't know what Tom knows.
I don't feel like doing anything today.
You'll never guess what Tom did.
"If my brother hadn't helped me, I would've drowned."
Tom said that he thought he knew what Mary planned on doing.
How did the fight start?
He fixed the net.
"Tom offered to carry Mary's suitcase, but she told him she wanted to carry it herself."
Please advise me on what to do.
Was Tom punished?
She is running.
That's the law.
I'm pretty sure that Tom has already forgotten what I told him yesterday.
"If you want to do that, I'm not going to try and stop you."
The officer shone his flashlight into the car.
The cool air felt wonderful on my face.
Ask Tom to bring Mary tomorrow.

I can't blame them.
I am not hungry.
All were satisfied.
Tom is the only person I've ever really been in love with.
I don't know if today is Tuesday or Wednesday.
I don't know where it is.
I don't have time to eat lunch right now.
Tom finally changed his name.
I'm beginning to get jealous.
The police showed me your picture.
Tom showed Mary where to put the boxes.
How many kilograms do you weigh?
Tom pretended not to know Mary's email address.
Maybe that's the reason.
"Tom, I'm home."
I'd think you'd understand.
The company published a new magazine.
Tom weighs twice as much as me.
Tom could've died.
How about a cup of coffee?
That's exactly what Tom told me.
You were the one who told me it was safe here.
"I know your time is valuable, but could I ask you just one question?"
I want to know where you live.
My neck is a little sore.
Who did you learn French from?
Looks can be deceiving.
Let's try once again.
I gave a speech at the wedding yesterday.
I have a friend in England.
Tom often stays up all night.
Can you count to ten in Chinese?
You've got the wrong number.
I haven't seen any of my old classmates since I graduated 15 years ago.
Come play with us.
I wouldn't have been able to do it without you.
"Sorry, I didn't hear you."
What are Tom and Mary talking about?
You'd better prepare Tom for the news.
Tom decided not to tell Mary about what John had done.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that serious.
"I recognized the teacher at once, because I had met him before."
He doesn't mind risking his life.
We want Tom to help Mary.
I'm happier than I've ever been.
I have to do my homework.
My watch is gold-plated.
I owe you a big apology.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
I brought some of my books to read.
Tom always listens to the news on the radio while he's eating breakfast.

Why are you so late?
Tom has been here three years.
Am I in love?
What instruments do you know how to play?
Can you skip me?
Write your name in capitals.
Tom doesn't need to do anything.
World War One had ended just 15 years earlier.
You are confusing me.
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
Anybody knows it.
I gave in to temptation and began to smoke a cigarette.
She's eating fruit.
Why did you give up the idea of learning French?

We're looking forward to that.
When was the last time Tom was late?
You should read between the lines.
She hasn't phoned since she went to London.
Tom is capable of doing it.
Do you know anything?
This is spaghetti.
I think it's important to tell him the facts.
Tom claimed he won.
May we speak in private?
I have a different opinion on that subject.
Tom ran back into the house.
How is your family doing?
Let's play hide and seek.
The killer could have been stopped.
Nothing will make up for his past mistakes.
Tom can't be all that bad.
He told her that he loved her.
He studies American history.
"When I awoke this morning, I felt hungry."
I always have to wear a tie because of my job.
"Tom smiled at Mary, but she didn't smile back."
She picked the most expensive dress.
Why did you wake me up?
I can carry that for you.
Where's my towel?
Hopefully the weather will be just like today.
I'll leave this to your imagination.
He cannot stop it.
"We don't want that, do we?"
Please take good care of yourself.

My neck hurts.
The motor does not function properly.
I have blue jeans on.
This is the very book I have been looking for.
You have a secret admirer.
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
The Dutch were just not in control any more.
You have a bright future.
Just ignore him.
Your approval is important to me.
They want it back.
Do you think we'll ever find a way to do that?
You should really get a haircut.
Tom speaks French a little.
He's not my father.
She is bustling about in the kitchen.
Come and see this.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He was happy being a Jew.
Who removed them?
I know you want to talk to Tom.
Tom didn't want to do something he would regret.
He asked a question about it.
I love my iPod.
Tom looks sick.
Do you speak Swedish?
You'd better not drink the tap water.
What exactly is your concern?

I only know how to play one song on the guitar.
I can't sleep on this lumpy mattress.
"If you don't want me to stay here, I'll leave."
"If it had not been for his help, I would have failed."
Tom is now ready to talk.
Please give me the details of the accident.
Do you agree with Tom's recommendations?
Tom stepped back from the blackboard.
How did Tom find out about that?
How can I ever forgive myself?
We're not going.
I almost always walk to work.
I am of the opinion that she is right.
What made you say such a stupid thing as that?
Tom brought a gift for Mary.
"When she entered the kitchen, no one was there."
Karin is a German name.
Do you want some more tea?
I know what kind of people Tom and Mary are.
Let's take a break for coffee.
She needs you.
"While I was waiting for the bus, I saw a traffic accident."
I wish I was with you.
What would you do if I weren't here?
Write these words in your notebook.
"I went over his report, but couldn't find any mistakes."
You have my permission to meet with him.
Wake us up in time for breakfast.
I've got just about everything I need.
Tom likes that.
How can I ever repay you?
Tom was bitten by a cobra.
That's a depressing thought.
Why are you siding with him?
That's an excellent choice.

She's made up her mind to quit the company.
Why didn't you tell me?
I think you know what I mean.
Tom and I'll do that.
Tom seems to like talking about himself.
He is popular with everybody.
This mountain is snow-covered the entire year.
"If you're busy, I'll help you."
I missed the 7:00 train.
You're losing.
Who found my wallet?
Life is interesting.
"Tom seldom, if ever, goes to church."
We haven't seen anyone.
I got wet to the skin.
Girls aren't welcome.
You'd better stay here.
Tom and Mary were discussing the pros and cons of raising the minimum wage.
I believe in ghosts.
Tom can't deny the fact that he did what Mary accused him of doing.
He is incapable of telling a lie.
Nobody noticed until it was too late.
I deeply regret having caused the accident.
It sickens me.
There were too many people there.
He visited Kyoto last year.
Tom didn't want to wait that long.
Tom says he regrets doing that.
Do you hear the birds singing?
The judge sustained the objection.
Thanks for seeing me.
Don't worry. He doesn't understand German.
I have Tom's key.
Tom needed thirteen stitches.
"Speaking of Nagoya, have you ever been to Seto?"
I don't need an interpreter.
The most beautiful girls are from Lithuania.
Did you turn off the gas?
There is a cat.
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
My mother is making dinner.
How come you're late?
He heard footsteps.
Did you enjoy your holiday?
The line is busy.
Do what he tells you.
Would you like to have another beer?
Tom is motionless.
Tom thinks that schools should teach children to obey authority.
"Mozart wrote brilliant, complex musical compositions as easily as you or I would write a letter."
She heard a dog barking in the distance.
It was stupid.
Do you like surfing?
This website seems quite good.
I wasn't honest.
He was wrong.
I met your friend.
I'm Tom's guardian.
Please take good care of yourself.
I can teach you how to shoot.
Tom wondered how much luggage Mary was planning to take.
They won the kissing contest.
I can't believe it's really Tom.
Tom and Mary both had no idea what John was talking about.
How did Tom respond?
Tom and Mary both have black hair.
His story was made up.
Crime does not pay.
I do think there's hope.
Did you practice the piano this morning?
Tom has already filed a complaint.
You have to go to the party.
Hardly anyone reads my blog.
May I borrow your dictionary?
Work is preferable to idleness.
I don't have time to make you a sandwich.
You said it!
You need to wash your hands.
I'll go in.
Tom said he was tired and wanted to go home early.
Do you want me to believe that?
Tom never wears a hat.
You have betrayed us.
Tom calls me almost every day.
We discussed the problem.
We need a place to stay for the night.
"If you bite me, I'll bite back."
I've waited all my life for this day.
It is cheaper to go by bus.
"We enjoyed seeing the city, but we got a little tired."
Tom refused to answer questions.
Do you really think Tom is going to be there?
We didn't know which car we should get in.
What did you do with my baggage?
Tom is fabulous.
Where is the French embassy?
I love green peppers.
Everyone has really been wonderful.
I want to be here with you.
Tom is waiting to see how things will develop.
This boat is no longer seaworthy.
What time will you get to the station?
He bought vegetables and some fruit.
It doesn't look like I'm going to be able to finish doing that before Monday afternoon.
Are you at home?
I would like him to write more often.
It's good to be here.
"Many things are easy to talk about, but difficult to actually carry out."
Do you want me to teach you some swear words?
You may swim.
Let's get out of here before it's too late.
Please let me know what you want.
Did she come here to relax?
I brought you some coffee.
He helped me to get over the difficulties.
The Champ du Feu was covered in snow.
Tom got confused.
Take a seat.
The horse broke its neck when it fell.
Tom seems much happier than Mary.
"I was planning to go there by bike, but it rained."
Tom talks quickly.
That's a bad loss.
Tom isn't yet ready to receive visitors.
Have you seen the recipe book that I wrote?
He denied having stolen the money.
She did her best to help him.
He looks young.
Which parent does the child resemble?
They waited for him for hours.
Tom knew nothing about it.
Why did you listen to him?
I can't stand him.
She's as pretty as her sister.
I think they like you.
She is not aware of her beauty.
Give me a hand.
Who are you quarreling with?
Don't blame Tom for what Mary did.
He never saw his mother again.
I can't stand all this noise.
The dog must be hungry.
I don't play the bassoon as much as I used to.
She cut the cake in two.
I have a boyfriend.
Thanks for the offer.
Tom really hates me for some reason.
They burst into tears.
Is his story true?
He has transmitted all his knowledge to his son.
I read his book.
I don't want to look stupid.
I went back to my seat.
She slapped him.
You won't get rid of me that easily.
You should call Tom.
He lost his balance and fell down.
The population of Osaka City is larger than that of Kyoto City.
Do as he tells you.
I still have so much to do.
Who's that man standing over there?
I shouldn't have trusted in someone like Tom.
You've been keeping something from me.
Don't open that door for anybody.
This'll work.
Tom says he still has no idea where Mary is.
Do you know how deep the water is here?
Let me speak to Tom first.
Tom is wearing sunglasses.
Did you take him home?
Tom likes carrots.
Wash your hands right now.
Do you think it's going to rain tomorrow?
I know people think I'm strange.
How big you are!
You hit the center of the target.
Are you a bachelor?
I like what you've written.
Nobody goes outside in this kind of weather.
Your question is hard to answer.
Tom wanted to become a diplomat.
Who actually performed the surgery?
We all want prices to fall.
I didn't think it'd happen this quickly.
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday.
I can't untie this knot.
I can't tell you what it's for.
"I didn't know how to do it, but I was willing to give it a try."
I agreed to help him in his work.
Balls are round.
See you guys later.
Tom thought only of Mary.
You're small.
I've got responsibilities.
Don't give me anything.
My brother is an engineer.
I don't think I want that.
I grew up in a poor family.
Did you bring rolls?
Step aside. You're blocking the way.
They went to church on Christmas Eve.
I'm much older than you are.
My right leg was injured in that accident.
I got a flat tire.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Would it be better to start early?
Winter is my favorite season.
You know I didn't mean it.
I'm not joking.
Tom isn't angry.
I'm interested.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
I've got a surprise for you.
This is disturbing.
A drunk driver was responsible for the car accident.
It's quarter to eight now.
What time is it?
Tom said that there was a monster under his bed.
"That one's for me, too."
Smoking is permitted.
You're way faster than me.
I got the idea that he would come by himself.
Was Tom killed?
I've lost my friends.
It was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
I've got a message for you.
You're a kind person.
"She has faults, too."
He left high school at seventeen.
Tom's French is quite good.
I don't know the truth.
Competition is good.
Please call before you come.
Tom passed the examination.
I'm a truck driver.
Maybe it won't rain tomorrow.
Mary changed into her evening gown.
You need help.
I took a shower.
I've been in Australia for over a year.
Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?
Tom refused to conceal the truth.
Call me at the office.
Tom is growing a beard.
Is that a new car?
She warned him not to go alone.
Tom beat Mary black and blue.
Tom got married.
Tom is doing well now.
I'll phone you when I arrive.
She has no one to speak to.
I've never stopped loving you.
I'll give you everything you need.
She smacked him across the face.
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
I can't help you if I don't know where you are.
They started dancing.
I don't like telling him the truth.
"Once upon a time, there lived a great king in Greece."
You don't have to thank us.
Don't you like any of these?
I want a guitar.
Put it onto the table.
The door will be painted tomorrow.
What's that very tall building?
I like your legs.
That country's economy is growing.
The exhibition will be open for another month.
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
You have an alternative.
Hurry up! The train is about to leave.
You may as well get used to it.
She sat next to me.
I don't think Tom will be here on time.
The man entered the next room.
I've got nothing to say to Tom.
Tom says he's OK.
I don't have anything to give you.
What are you afraid of?
Do you want to play soccer with us?
Tom expects that Mary will help us.
I knew Tom personally.
Tom suggested ways we could save money.
You have no need to be ashamed.
People can't stop talking about how nice a couple Tom and Mary are.
I don't care what you think of me.
We have walked all around the lake.
Pus has formed in the wound.
I can see it in your eyes.
I hate myself sometimes.
I would've sent Tom money.
They set to work at once.
Tom is Mary's most famous son.
Are you athletic?
The American economy was stronger than ever.
That has nothing to do with me.
Please put the book on the shelf.
The prize money enabled me to go on a world cruise.
We carried on the discussion till late at night.
They are running in the park.
She spoke to me in Spanish.
You need a change of air.
We're honeymooning.
Tom answered quickly.
"You can't hide forever, Tom."
Tom has three pens in his pocket.
We are just friends.
I'll be at home the next time she comes.
Don't risk your fortune on that.
"All the doctors say that I shouldn't drink coffee, but, despite that, I do have a bit now and then when I'm in good company."
Drop the gun.
Why weren't you at school yesterday?
Tom is there.
Have you had breakfast yet?
I can't believe it's already time to go home.
You're no longer part of my life.
Maybe you should apologize for all of the stupid things you did.
Tom seemed a bit angry.
He is in his library.
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.
"When Tom asked me to marry him, I said yes."
We need someone to keep an eye on our baby while we are away.
He has dozens of English books.
"I don't like carrots. ""Neither do I."""
Where is the source of this river?
"Tom's smarter than you, you know."
Got it?
Tom helped me write this essay.
I went to the store to buy what I needed to make dinner.
"Whose cats are these? ""They are Fatima's."""
His poetry does not translate into Japanese.
I don't sleep as many hours a day as I used to.
You sound very sure of yourself.
You're a true friend.
That's cool.
Ammonia is a base.
She appears to have many friends.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
This dictionary can also help you.
"I'm sorry, did you say something?"
There is an apple under the desk.
She didn't take part in our conversation.
I was at a friend's house.
Tom just watched.
I have no desire to go there.
Tom spent his birthday in the hospital.
Why do you have your umbrella up? It's not raining.
This train is bound for Boston.
That was the most exciting concert I have ever been to.
"I want to thank you, Tom."
Tom broke into my house.
Are you sure that Tom is behind this?
Do you think Boston is a safe city?
He feels a good deal better than yesterday.
It began raining just now.
Is that suitable?
My hometown is in the center of Hokkaido.
I've fallen in love with you.
Are you being serious?
Tom doesn't have a car and Mary doesn't either.
We're going to miss doing this.
You're only three years older than me.
What's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?
"Like I said, no problem."
We heard the bomb go off.
Drunk people are so entertaining.
Let's take a taxi.
I booked a seat.
I'm in Boston.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
Tom went to church with Mary.
The conference takes place annually.
I should've known it was you.
I know you don't like me.
Tom works six days a week but only gets paid for five.
Those who are present are all Japanese.
I rarely talk on the phone.
Are you still living with your parents?
I seldom go to a library.
What do we have to do?
Could you please tell me what your cell phone number is?
Is it that urgent?
I will find you a good doctor.
I'm watching you.
We should've done what you advised.
Tom wants to think it over.
I think times are changing.
I need a cup of hot coffee.
Parts of the book are quite good.
He is worried about losing his job.
I really want to meet Tom.
You must have lost them.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
That sounds reasonable.
We have to avoid the nuclear war by all means.
Please call me at this number.
We will keep the room warm.
I know all the details.
Tom suffocated Mary with a plastic bag.
He went out with a bundle of clothes in his hand.
Are you giving this to Tom?
Any student can answer that question.
Her bike is blue.
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
No one here knows anything.
Tom hummed along.
Can you show it to me?
I handed the mike to him.
Being on time for appointments is very important.
You should've told me Tom wasn't planning to go with us.
He's lying.
You owe me something.
I have to change schools.
The man robbed the traveler of his money.
All the boys were whistling and cheering.
I have a green car.
I hope to see you soon.
I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
Tom is my youngest brother.
I'll need your help.
The train came to a smooth stop.
I don't like your boss.
I am very sorry.
We are against war.
What's the fax number for this hotel?
Have you ever been to the Korean Peninsula?
No one uses that kind of weapon anymore.
That's a problem we have to deal with all the time.
Tom doesn't remember his password.
You still have a lot to learn about relationships.
This is a mistake.
Why are people always so cynical?
Tom borrowed a large amount of money from Mary.
Have you eaten the cake yet?
There are many apple trees in the garden.
I refuse to accept that.
That's not so important.
How much does Tom know about Mary?
Tom had to go himself.
I'm learning to play the clarinet.
His daughter is able to recite a lot of poems.
Such painters as Picasso are rare.
What time do you start boarding?
He went to Boston by car.
It is very kind of you to help me.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Do you believe me?
When was the last time you took the subway?
Do what Tom tells you to do.
That's a splendid idea.
Tom seems unconvinced.
I don't like what's going on.
Are you going to see Tom again?
I want you to leave my house.
He tries.
Why are you so hard-headed?
Tom loves that.
The baby began to crawl.
A horse can run very fast.
All is calm tonight.
What color are they?
What is good for you is good for me.
I don't know what I want.
Truth is more important than beauty.
You'll do no such thing.
I have a lot of money in my savings account.
We have a few questions for you.
Tell me about Tom.
I forgot to write my name on the exam.
I'm a member here.
The policeman chased the burglar.
It's going to be great.
Your anger is completely justified.
It's true that she's dead.
I'm the only one who understands you.
They sought shelter from the rain.
I don't have to say a word.
What a nice surprise!
I want to be as happy as Tom.
We were mistaken.
What's your favorite color for carpets?
You should've heard me. I shouted as loud as I could.
I'll ask Mary out.
You're the most beautiful woman I know.
Stop looking down.
He leaped over the shallow ditch.
She looked him in the face.
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight.
I waited for her for one hour.
You ought to have told me that before.
"Tom can swim, but Mary can't."
Can you please leave me alone?
The problem is that I don't have any money.
I don't want to hear another word out of you.
There is a large choice of bags in this shop.
I think this is a good thing.
He hates her parents.
Tom is still overweight.
Why don't we take a taxi?
It'll take some time.
I've already talked to Tom about that matter.
"He is a nice person, to be sure, but not very clever."
I'm more afraid of them than I am of you.
The cat is sleeping on the chair.
Tom may have taken my umbrella by mistake.
So what else is new?
Do you want to come with us?
I thought Tom and Mary were busy.
Mary represented her team in the competition.
It's best not to ask.
She sent me a letter.
Don't make noise here.
Why don't you tend to your own affairs?
Tom betrayed Mary's trust.
Can you validate this parking ticket?
That's childish.
I thought you might back out.
Such a thing occurs frequently.
He got a D.
What are you sorry about?
Do you want to do it again?
I haven't unpacked my clothes yet.
Maybe you should've thought of that before you did what you did.
When did you see him last?
Don't you work in the cafeteria?
Maybe Tom didn't see us.
You will never be alone.
Tom put on his helmet and then got on his motorcycle.
Do not give in to those demands.
Do you have any gum?
Would you like a glass of white wine?
No animals are to be found on the island.
He kissed me passionately.
Do you love her?
I don't know what to do or what to say.
Tom and Mary go hiking together every summer.
You'll have to ask Tom.
I'm worried about my weight.
That almost sounds too good to be true.
Tom needs time to think it over.
I'm afraid it's going to rain tomorrow.
I wish I'd kept up my French.
I don't have any brothers.
Don't say things like that.
Tom doesn't look much older than Mary.
I'm double-parked. Could you hurry it up?
Mary trimmed the stems of the flowers Tom gave her so they'd fit into the vase.
Nobody seems to know who's in charge.
Tom laid flowers at Mary's grave.
He will pass the upcoming examination.
The sky grew darker and darker.
Can you hear it?
The food's ready.
"Of all the countries I've visited, I liked Australia the best."
The place is worth visiting at least once.
"I was born on October 10, 1972."
I said nothing about the matter.
Can we enhance the image?
Old habits are hard to break.
I can't remember.
I'm a photographer.
That is the same color as mine.
Tom usually only reads the headlines.
I missed the first thirty minutes of the movie.
I'll call you a taxi.
Tom stole money from Mary's purse.
It's not just a theory.
He failed to catch the 8:30 train.
Do you know this song?
Are you here with someone?
"That's what I want, too."
Are you good at math?
Tom didn't promise me anything.
Tom will be here for three more weeks.
It's the 20th of October.
Tom is different from other boys.
The accident occurred at dawn.
Where did you get on this bus?
Tom can't decide whether to buy a new computer now or wait for a couple of more months.
"You don't love Tom, do you?"
This sink is made of stainless steel.
He showed me how to use this camera.
It's awfully cold today.
Tom won't be able to do anything about the problem this week.
Her hair is wet with sweat.
That's sweet of you to say.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
Tell Tom about it.
Tom is talented.
It's all over now.
When was the last time you had a steady job?
Why are you apologizing?
"I had a part-time job as a hotel maid, but I didn't like it very much."
I disagree with you on the matter.
I'm thinking of going to Europe.
This hospital has a lot of new equipment.
Tom has helped us in the past.
Tom grabbed a letter opener off his desk.
These keys are not mine.
We need your help.
I'll wait till four o'clock.
Why are you siding with Tom?
We'll be late for dinner.
This book is written in French.
Are you interested in foreign languages?
Start now.
I have a better plan.
I've known it all along.
No sooner had she entered her room than she began to cry.
He got off the train.
I don't like to run.
We are soccer players.
Don't let me down.
All Tom can think about is food.
She accused me of stealing her money.
Are you sure about that?
I'm no rebel.
I wonder what would happen if Tom walked in here right now.
How's it coming?
Tom could tell that Mary was dying.
They've lost their umbrellas.
She cooks well.
Will we be the only students taking the exam tomorrow?
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore.
Don't count on it.
Put the dough in the refrigerator overnight.
Tom couldn't have done it alone.
I can't answer your question.
"Personally, I don't think it makes any difference who wins the election."
There is no furniture left in the room.
"Just as the Americans like baseball, the British like cricket."
Tom should have been more careful.
When will they give a concert?
You're not Canadian.
Tom began to sing his favorite song and Mary harmonized with him.
He suggested that the meeting be put off till Monday.
This plane flies nonstop to Tokyo.
The price of oil is going up.
I'm from the city.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
Tom grabbed some paper towels and wiped his hands.
I'll be waiting over there.
Do it for Tom.
It wasn't mine.
He lost his credibility because he betrayed a friend.
I thought you were a nurse.
There must have been some more tea in the pot.
Butter is made from cream.
I'm sure you're sleepy.
I want to go to the park.
I thought you were going to be gone all afternoon.
"Of all the things Tom did last weekend, he says that windsurfing was the most fun."
Do you see me?
Will anybody be at the station to meet me?
Tom seemed lonely.
It's the largest in the world.
Tom sat in the first row.
"People, goods and money are all free to move across national borders in the region."
All the bank robbers were wearing masks.
I like to sing.
Defensive driving can help you avoid accidents.
"When I got to his house, he had already been taken away."
I won't be blackmailed.
I hope you're not planning on wearing that to the party.
A trip to Hawaii will cost you about 200 dollars.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
The student council discussed plans for the graduation.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It is dark in that room.
You should have killed me when you had the chance.
The floorboards creaked.
I don't worry about Tom.
You can have my sandwich.
Are you bored here?
Women don't like Tom.
I bet it works.
I arrived here just now.
I'm not incompetent.
I don't know how to use this.
"If you try very hard, you will succeed."
Tom said that school did little to prepare him for life.
"Say it again, please."
Tom drew a picture of a squirrel.
Please wake me up at six tomorrow morning.
"As far as I know, he is one of the best doctors in town."
This is a sick joke.
It's not going to be like that.
My chest hurts when I breathe.
"Tom drives a black car, doesn't he?"
She has a white cat.
Tom is considering several possibilities.
He was raised in an artistic family.
Tom left to go fishing shortly before dawn.
What's that awful sound?
I didn't realize what time it was.
You know him.
I love you just the way you are.
"If you plant an apple seed, it might grow into a tree."
This screwdriver is too small to be any use.

Which continent is the most populated one?
They said they're happy.

The smoke is rising in the air.
It's been forty years since I began to study Japanese.
Did anything out of the ordinary happen at school today?
Why are you always so suspicious?
Tom has decided to ignore your advice.
I have to see this.
They got along very well.
We were lucky.
We're surprised.
He doesn't love me.
Tom has three cameras.
Why did you help me?
Tom sometimes chews with his mouth open.
He can play the flute.
What is it you'd like to know?
My brother gave me a charming baby doll.
Tom is a singer.
I worked on it until the last minute.
Be sure to put out the fire before you leave.
What does that have to do with Tom?
It would take a long time to explain it to you.
He is able to play the flute.
"Before I went to bed, I set the alarm clock for seven."
This time is no different.
Where is my car?
"For a moment there, I thought he had gone mad."
It would be crazy to climb that mountain in the winter.
Count me in.
Tom is quite outgoing.
I let Tom borrow my baseball glove.
I know the girl you were talking to yesterday.
Are you going to tell Tom?
What do you think Tom is doing?
The patient is now out of danger.
He put the key on the desk as usual.
Tom drives me crazy.
What are you wearing tonight?
Don't you have any ambition?
We can see thousands of stars in the sky.
Would you please pick me up at the hotel on Friday July 11th at 10:00 a.m.?
It's a good thing Tom isn't here.
Are you seriously thinking about quitting your job?
That shouldn't be too difficult.
This car is mine.
I'm coming home.
I'm going to church.
Look around you.
Those books are theirs.

We have had a lot of snow this winter.
"I'm disappointed in you, Tom."
Tom likes traveling.
We need to do it immediately.
I don't always do this.
Tom drank milk.
I'd like to make reservations for dinner tomorrow.
Do you have anything to declare?
I saw a man with a red hat.
Tom didn't tell me the whole truth.
Everybody wants to sit beside her.
Six families live in this apartment house.
Tom picked up the newspaper and read the headlines.
I have a terrible headache.
Tom did a sloppy job.
Tom met Mary on the way to school.
It's very hot in here.
I saw a black cat run into the house.
You should have done so.
We need to stick together.

You should've never come here.

The sister of your father or mother is your aunt.
All of your cats are grey.
Tom can't keep his eyes off Mary.
Send the telegram at once.
Don't put anything on top of the box.
She called off the party.
I saw the figure of a man.
I'm sure you're not going to like this.
You are a good cook.
She is kind to him.
Read it to me.
That's why I told you that you shouldn't go alone.

Don't let Tom go outside today.
Tom threw out the old newspapers.
Is it anything like mine?
Tom resisted the urge to scream.
She left the room without saying goodbye.
Tom can't whistle.
I finished the work yesterday.
Forget about Tom.
Will you be ready to leave tomorrow?
Did he propose any solutions?
I need them.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
Tom hurried to catch up with Mary.
She is not herself today.
Did I ask your opinion?
How old were you when this town had the big fire?
You look just like your father.
Why were you eating by yourself?
You can't even help yourself.
She promised her father to be in time for lunch.
Keep to the right.
The company spends a lot of money on advertising.
I suggest you have a talk with Tom.
I feel worse today than I did yesterday.

Gas is cheap now.
I hope Tom never finds out.

Tom broke his new toy.
You must come back before it gets dark.
I love pizza.
Tom didn't follow.
Why are you mad at Tom?
I doubt that Tom can help you.
Tom knows a lot about wild animals in this area.
I challenged him to a game.
Have you measured it?

You should begin with easier questions.
Give me the spoon.
"You don't know, do you?"
I fed my dog what I thought was good quality dog food.
We chose Tom as captain.
Can you speak Chinese well?
You'd be crazy to ride a bicycle without brakes.
That's why I don't like you.
They asked a medical expert to do more research.
You'd better not do anything like that again.
You can't always do what you want.
Tom won't be ready until October.
I study once in a blue moon.
We have already finished our dinner.
"In an emergency, do you act quickly?"
You had better do as the doctor advised you.

"He said nothing, which made her angry."
I just washed the dishes and now I have to take out the trash.
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as he speaks English.

It's the first time that anybody said something like that to me.
Tom doesn't have a sense of humor.
Are you willing to drive me to the station?
Tom is our son.
Won't you come with me?
I hit on an idea.

Can you continue?
I support the proposal.

She's usually home on Sundays.
We were asked to do that.

We want to make absolutely sure that Tom wants to do that.
Don't you have any friends?
See to it that he does not go there.

Tom recommended me.
I want to buy a new camera.
Have you ever been to Boston before?
"It was hard for me to sell my guitar, but I needed the money."
He worked all day yesterday.
It's nice to just sit here and talk with you.
Do you really believe that Tom is reliable?
Tom was abroad.
Tom is wheezing.
Your friendship has great value to me.
Who came?
You've become a very beautiful woman.
Did you speak with Tom?
We've never been to Boston.
Which car is Tom's?
Tom opened a new restaurant.
Those houses are 500 years old.
Tom had no idea where Mary had graduated from high school.
We left him some cake.
Tom drove back to Mary's house.
Tom got discouraged.
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
"She bought him a car, but he didn't have a driver's license so he couldn't drive it anywhere."

Tom needs to study more if he hopes to pass this class.
We tried to come to a compromise with them.
This dam supplies us with water and electricity.
How weird!
Life is beautiful.
Call me when you get there.
Don't you want to go to Boston?
Would you mind if I open the window?
It is not the best solution.
He lived and died in obscurity.
I don't understand what you're saying.
You're motivated.
Tom eats breakfast every morning at six o'clock.
Tom sounds sad.
It made me forget about my problems.
Tom thanked Mary for her help.
Tom seems to know a lot about me.
He didn't notice the change.

Tom is just the man for the job.
Have you known Tom long?
You never trusted me.
Tom moved into his new apartment on October 20th.
What do you do for a living?
I want you to not go to Boston with Tom.
I'll send it to you tomorrow.
The man reading a newspaper is his father.
We'll be watching you.
I did everything Tom asked me to do.
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn't do it.
Aren't those your parents?
I never want to see you get in trouble.
Is money important to you?
"If you can't come, you should let me know ahead of time."
You can't stay for long.
I just woke up a few minutes ago.
"Each individual paid 1,000 dollars."
I was kind of surprised Tom said that.
The queen stood beside the king.
I nearly had a heart attack.
Tom got on his bike and left.
Tom had no life insurance.
This would be a mistake.
Tom blacked out.
My wife isn't beautiful. Yours is.
They make a perfect couple.
Accidents happen all the time.
I thought this was important.
Do you have money?
That's not a bad idea.
Tom turned on the air conditioner and the apartment began to cool down.
What subjects are you taking at school?
I'm unlucky.
I really have to get going.
I thought you'd love it.
It's across the street.
You don't belong here.
You've earned it.
I never go anywhere.
He made me so angry that I got a headache.
I hope that you'll help me.
I like to win prizes.
It's just not worth the effort.
I'll keep this for future use.
I think that Tom wants to do that tomorrow.
It was a most beautiful flower.
What's your explanation?
Tom went out of his way to make sure Mary had a good time.
Tom offered me a cup of coffee.
Where does this street lead to?
Tom doesn't know when Mary will visit Boston.

It's obsolete.
Tom believed the story that Mary told him.
My driving instructor says I should be more patient.
How are things going with your youngest sister?
I am divorced.
I'm anxious to see you.
How many people have you told?
Tom vomited twice.
He probably won't come.
I thought you'd want this one.
This is my other sister.
Tom is either in the garage or in his bedroom.
There's no hot water.
Why don't you drop in?
That really hurts.
Let me do it.
I must get home before it gets dark.
I understand French.
There's got to be a way.
I don't want to go shopping by myself.
I have never seen such a thing.
Tom and Mary live in a house by the river.
I just told you something I've never told anyone else.

He's lazy.
I took Highway 58.
I just wanted to listen to some music.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I'll kill you.
I like fish.
How much do I owe you for the ticket?
The crow flew away.
I don't want to participate in the ceremony.
I'm in a good mood.
My dream is to be a doctor.
Tom and Mary adopted two children whose parents had been killed by a suicide bomber.
What did Tom just tell you?
"Tom's a creature of habit, and does pretty much the same things every day."
Tom comes from a culture where women artificially color their lips and put holes in their earlobes.
The proof is trivial.
What they are doing is ruining the economy.
You should try to behave better.
Tom got out of the swimming pool and dried himself off with a towel.
I know how old Tom is.
Tom opened the curtains.
"In the future, try to get to the office on time."
I want to see him at all costs.
Tom and Mary didn't recognize each other.
I don't know what's wrong with you today.
Please remind me to turn in the paper tomorrow.

These fireworks are spectacular!
He plays tennis three times a week.

Tom brought me a glass of water.
Do you come here every day?
She took a ten-day trip to Europe with her friends.
I told Tom that his French was easy to understand.
Please leave my things as they are.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
Life is too short to worry about things like that.
Tom isn't here anymore.
He was still in his teens when he founded a company.
A virus infected Tom's computer.
Tom couldn't sneak out of the dorm without being seen.
Tom took an envelope out of his briefcase and handed it to Mary.
I hope you're having fun.
You sure made me look stupid.

What's this computer doing here?
Tom's hands are greasy.
I dealt with the accident.
I know things.
Tom says he doesn't want to do that with you.
Where do Tom and Mary live?
"I'm hungry, too."
He reads before bedtime.
I had scarcely left home when it began to rain.
The distance from the sun to the earth is about 93 million miles.

Do you want to know why I'm here?
Do you know where my glasses are?
Naples is a picturesque city.
Who does this land belong to?
They lost.

I'm getting tired of your complaints.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I'm much heavier than you.
My family thinks I'm rich.
Tom is outspoken.
"The ship was searched thoroughly, but no illegal drugs were found."
I want you to take me to Tom.
The work calls for patience.
My father died of cancer.
Everybody seems to pay attention to what he says.
Some people questioned his honesty.
That's no way for a young lady to act.
I'm not afraid of Tom anymore.
Mireille Mathieu is one of France's best singers.
I have a friend who feeds his dog strawberries.
You should write it down before you forget it.

Tom and Mary went to church together.
What did you do there?
Why don't you try and get some sleep?

Do you like to play games?
I don't understand what this means at all.
We're never going to find out who did that.
Is he correct?
I wanted to know what happened.
We celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary yesterday.
She finished her lunch quickly and went shopping.

Stores are closed in the afternoon because of the heat.
He's a rather rare individual.
Give me the money.
I am eighteen years old.
Tom is out on an errand.
"This is yours, isn't it?"
I don't think Tom liked the concert.
"He is at work now, but will be coming home at seven."
The tree cast a shadow across the road.
He said nothing that would make her angry.
Tom never goes to school by bus.
My father used to read books to me at bedtime.
I'm coming back.
Why didn't you tell us you knew French?
We ran out of gas.
"What about you, Tom?"
Tom watched Mary dance.
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
She baked me a cake.
I don't want to interrupt Tom while he's speaking.
Please keep that secret.
Why is Tom so scared?
I'll do what needs to be done.
"It's important, so I'll do it."
Are they arriving at ten o'clock in the morning or at night?
"When he saw me, he ran away."
Have you read this yet?
You have a very nice smile.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
We needed Tom's help.
It's not too deep.
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.
Tom said that he thought Mary wouldn't want to visit the place where her father had committed suicide.
Do you have psychic powers?
I just want to talk to you.
You look nervous.
It's been ages since we last met.
I'm not going to miss Tom.
I'll have to think about it.
Why did you do something stupid like that?
Do you have change for a dollar?
I told you you'd be disappointed.
Are you really a nun?
"The notice in the park said, ""Keep off the grass."""
Tom was motivated.
I hate chemistry.
Are you sure you can afford this?
He's already left.
I hope Tom says no.
I'm heavier than you.
Tom got off the bus.
How long have Tom and Mary known each other?
We managed to swim across the river.
How long will the repairs take?
There is a cat on the chair.

I took a break.
She played the violin.
I see a giraffe.
I don't feel at home in her company.
Tom wants way too much money.
He likes listening to the radio.
This is the last straw!
"The polka is from Poland, as is the polonaise."
Tom felt terrific.
He's very skeptical.
Are my socks dry already?
This is my business address.
I'll come and see you later.

Peace talks will begin next week.
I'm feeding the goldfish.
Keep walking.
Don't be insulted.
He reminds me of somebody.
What do you want to do now?
What's desirable isn't always doable.
I'm sure Tom had good reasons for doing that.
I stayed at my uncle's during the summer.
Someone should talk to him and tell him what's what.
The population of the town was wiped out.
There are exceptions to every rule.
You seem to be in all these pictures.
That's not a useful piece of information.
Tom hardly ever acts his age.
A strange car was parked in front of my house.
Tom forgot to remove the price tag.
He had the last laugh.
He's studying.
You're an overly optimistic girl.
Is Tom working?
I saw it on TV.
"In order to do that, you have to take risks."
He's got a crush on her.
Do you speak Bulgarian?
Tom suggested that I write Mary a letter.
I work here.
Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary needed to do that.
I realize the effort you have put into this project and I really appreciate it.
How many bowls of rice did you eat?
The snake swallowed a frog.
This milk tastes sour.
I cleaned the house.
I wish there were a better translation of this book.
Tom wasn't there.
"That house is small, but it's big enough for us."
Someone stole Tom's money.
Why did you open the door?
You have made many mistakes.
Do you know where he went?
Did you draw this yourself?
A cat can see in the dark.
Would you like to go?

I remember the event as clearly as if it had happened just yesterday.
Tom has not yet been told of his father's death.
What's Tom's last name?
I must buy a new winter coat.
How old were your kids when you moved to Boston?

I don't like cold coffee.
You're driving too fast.
I will give you anything you want.

Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
My room is just below.
"When I entered his room, I found him reading a book."
We always want what we don't have.
He has a large family.
"Daddy, I can't walk any more. Carry me."
Tom boiled the potatoes.
I never gave up hope.
I didn't realize that Tom had never gone to high school.
Tonight we celebrate.
Tom is looking good.
What exactly did you do?
He isn't afraid of death.
I need that information as soon as possible.
Tom still lives at home.
We can still talk to Tom.
I love watching you cook.
She tore the letter into a thousand pieces.
I seriously doubt that.
Start here.
Maybe we already have enough money to buy a house.
She's afraid of getting sick again.
I pointed this out to Tom.
It makes me feel uncomfortable.
You need not worry about her.
Tokyo is bigger than Yokohama.
I was looking for you.
I understand Japanese a little.
I can't believe that Tom just left without saying anything.
Do you think that's wise?

They attend every meeting.

Her mother was busy cooking the dinner.
There used to be a bridge here.
Can you catch a ball with one hand?
You must steer clear of that gang.
Let me be.
He's now aboard the ship.
He seems to know the secret.
Be like me and have a glass of wine.
He's an old friend of mine.
Tom loves doing this.
He is not qualified for the job.
The room was bathed in sunshine.
All men must die.
She was too proud to ask him for help.
I have a house not too far from here.
It's only four minutes from here by train.
She is not as beautiful as her older sister.

It is stupid of you to make such a mistake.

I'll let you know tomorrow.
Just give it a try.
It's almost dark.
I don't know what Tom is planning to do.
I came here to study French.

The price of rice rose by more than three percent.
"Louder, please."
Tom is depraved.
I think that's impossible in Tom's case.
I'm not as creative as Tom is.
I awoke to find myself famous.

I suspect he is ill.
I have an appointment with the professor at 1:30.
I'll give you anything but this.

Deal with it.
What do your friends call you?
Tom's very sad.
Don't go there.
Tom didn't know what else to do.
Is Tom asking too much of us?
We haven't met yet.
I am tired of hearing that.
Tom lives across the river.
I'm out of here.
Do you think I'm stupid?
I love the way you laugh.
I don't think Tom knows that.
I had a headache.
"I won't give up, no matter what you say."
Have you heard this story already?
I'd like to visit Boston at least one more time before I die.
Tell me where you got this.
The girl didn't say anything.
Who will compensate for the loss?
Do you think it was Tom who did that?
"I'm already full, thank you."
Do you have a car?
All is well with me.
He made up his mind to marry her.

"The less you know, the better."
I have a very old stamp.

What's your favorite part of the chicken?
He pretended not to see me.
This meeting is a waste of time. Everybody is just talking in vague theoretical terms.

Have you eaten breakfast yet?
The boy admitted having broken the vase.
Let Tom do his job.
When did you last hear from Tom?
Will you tell me where I am wrong?

Can you make it on time?
Her skin is as white as snow.

It was just the beginning.
He's not home.
I'm still waiting for my order.
I won't ever mention this again.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Tom circled three names on the list.
What Tom said wasn't true.
I just want you back.
They'll find you.

The honor is more than I deserve.
"Would you like to go to the movies? ""I'd love to, but I'm busy."""

Most young people have mobile phones.
His criticisms were out of place.
We never swim.
Tom asked Mary to go to Boston with him.
I don't usually write this kind of song.
"Something's on your mind, isn't it?"
Get out of my sight!
Tom knows that Mary didn't win.
We don't need you.
One of my friends wants to move in with me.
You didn't let me finish my sentence.
Did you hear about the fire yesterday?
"A few years ago, there was a huge scandal."
I don't miss Tom a bit.
Tom was mortified.
I think everyone gets a bit lonely at times.
Is it true that you can't swim?
I wrote this song just for you guys.
Whose side is Tom on?
We study Chinese.
You'd better come up with something fast.
Tom isn't in.

Tom sat on the porch reading the newspaper.
"You're not sleepy, are you?"
Tom enjoys school.
"Even if I knew, I couldn't tell you."
Mary isn't really sick. She's faking it.
Let's divide this money between you and me.
You need a new hat.

Can I help?

January is the first month of the year.
Are you looking for a job?
There's a picture of Tom on the wall.
The bomb was defused by the bomb squad.
The shoe doesn't fit me. It's too small.

That's not what you said last night.
His wounded leg began to bleed again.
"Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa, watching TV."

He pushed past me.
What's your point?
I bribed the policeman.
The park was full of people.

Tom just barely earns enough to live on.
The police can't question Tom until his lawyer gets here.
We regard the situation as serious.

You didn't need to come.
Tom scratched his nose.
I think this tie will go great with that shirt.

We have a situation here.
What would you recommend we eat?
The children competed with each other for their mother's attention.
Who's your favorite painter?

She became more and more beautiful as she grew older.
How did you do that without our help?
Do you need a hand with your suitcases?
I am not a teacher.

Light is no less necessary to plants than water.
Why are you crying?

Maybe we're both mistaken.
"He may be clever, but he often makes careless mistakes."
Leave that job to the experts!
"How long have you been living here? ""It'll be five years next week."""
I want you to take me to Tom.
Please remind me to mail the report tomorrow.
You'd be stupid if you tried to do that by yourself.
This is the town where he was born.
I kept the $20 I found in the street.
This is really important.
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
He told me the story of his life.
I want to stay here longer.
It was Tom's idea to try it this way.
Tom became sleepy.
He came all the way from Chicago.
"I thought you liked him. ""I do."""
Tom isn't interested in politics at all.
"Tom's not much of a cook, but at least he gives it a go."
Did you take part in the discussion yesterday?
Did you have to wait long?
Show it to Tom.
Dr. Hawking had almost finished writing a book.
The two boys began to blame each other.
We have to find out what we're supposed to do.
I can do breaststroke but not backstroke.
Tom behaved himself.
Tom attended Mary's funeral.
Could I ask a favor of you?
Have Tom do it.
Please buy a tube of toothpaste.
He always invites himself for dinner.
Tom laughed again.
Do you know anybody who speaks five languages?
We'd better go home now.
The post office is a few minutes' walk from here.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
I'm very rich.
It happens.
I don't regret it at all.
Tom really hates Mary.
Don't bother to come to my house.
Why does he always behave so badly?
When did he come here?
Tom is artistic.
We've waited a long time for this day.
How does it feel to be back?
Trust is earned.
I'd like to see those reports.
Turn on the TV.
You can't drink the water here.
Tom has a limp.
I have a backache.
Do you think I'm made of money?
I advise you not to do that.
He will be back in an hour.
They spoke quietly so as not to wake the baby.
Tom knows what Mary did.
Could I have some of your beer?
She tried to kill herself.
Tom has my car.
Do men cry?
"After I had done my homework, I went to bed."
I hope to be a journalist.
What are you guys looking at?
I thought Tom could help.
She helped her mother clean the house.
He likes potato salad.
You'd better be careful.
I waited.
How many concerts did you go to last year?
Do you want to play with me?
I have nothing else to wear.
We should help people in need.
He ran into debt.
I think we found it.
I can't imagine why.
My neighbor is planting new grass in his yard.
I don't have to go.
Why are you looking at me that way?
Can you tell if this is Tom's?
How long have you been waiting?
Tom has just left.
You can't just go.
Tom reluctantly followed Mary.
Leave out this word.
I don't care how much money you have.
Do you use a sponge when you take a bath?
Could I talk to you alone for a second?
I don't really like him.
I rode fifty miles that day.
I think Tom stole my bicycle.
He has eleven children.
I wonder if Tom will be in Australia next year.
I love bearded men.
Do what you like.
Tom didn't want to name names.
He prefers French to German.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
Tom doesn't want to admit that he has a drinking problem.
I didn't ask Tom to dance. He asked me.
I'll take care of the dog till tomorrow.
His joke made all the class burst into laughter.
I always take a bus.
I will buy a new car next month.
Are you famous?
Hundreds of people work in this factory.
Tom is repairing his car.
The old lady is still counting her change.
Take your elbows off the table.
Tom is very generous.
Tom swam.
Tom's wife doesn't like it when he smokes in the living room.
"The more popcorn you eat, the more you want."
It's a problem we do not have any answer for.
"When I was in school, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands."
I feel fantastic.
We don't know what they want to use it for.
I have no idea why Tom isn't here.
Tom asked me if I had ever done that.
The frescoes of the cathedral are very interesting.
Tom will be thirteen next month.
You can tell me the truth.
Did the police arrest Tom?
The police decided to arrest him.
Tom had no one to tell his story to.
They'll know.
I'll return to my country someday soon.
It's just a cat.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
"I'll go at three, or rather at a quarter past three."
Cats can see in the dark.
I will show you around the city.
Don't make me say it.
That tape recorder recorded his voice.
All the supplies ran out.
Tom said it was Mary who borrowed his sunglasses.
What was I supposed to say?
The situation became worse by the minute.
I didn't notice him go out.
"Are you ready, Tom?"
I don't live in Boston anymore.
Tom speaks French as well as I do.
We had to walk home.
His plan was discarded.
Tom lived with his uncle in Australia while going to college.
I didn't even get a chance to eat anything.
"Tom saw it, too."
Don't you read the sports pages?
What's not to like?
Do you think it's a good idea to feed your dog table scraps?
I won't answer that.
"You know the way, don't you?"
Young children are often fascinated by science.
Did you behave today?
You can see a lot of stars in the sky.
"Natto smells awful, but tastes delicious."
I wish she could have come.
Tom avoided answering Mary's question.
Let's wait here.
They want to separate after 40 years of marriage.
We know you're very rich.
I have no friend to talk with.
People lived in villages.
"In case of a fire, use the stairs."
What were they doing there?
I wish I could give up smoking.
She visited him on October 20th.
Tom said he thought that Mary's suggestion was good.
Nobody is scared of Tom.
I'll use it.
She knows how to make candy.
Perhaps you have misunderstood the aim of our project.
Would you mind if I take a look?
I'm looking forward to working with you.
Tom said it wasn't necessary.
Do you have a book?
Don't you want to say goodbye to Tom?
Did you sue Tom?
He pressed down on the suitcase to close it.
The ship was soon out of sight.
I can't pay you back the money you lent me.
There are exceptions.
"You have no idea who that is, do you?"
Tom really likes swimming.
Tom lives in a large house with a pool.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do that.
Is that your boyfriend?
"Tom won't be skiing with us, will he?"
Tom hasn't been answering his phone.
Can you fix the flat tire now?
My opinion is a little different from yours.
You missed a spot.
He will come home in a few days.
He's not smart enough to work it out in his head.
China is about twenty-five times as large as Japan.
Haven't you ever heard of Rio de Janeiro?
Tom said he wasn't being paid enough.
Her first appearance on the stage was in 1969.
Have you found anything?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
Tom just wanted to be neighborly.
Did you forget to feed the dog?
I think it's worth a try.
I still need to finish my homework.
Why are you afraid of Tom?
"I'm sorry, I just wanted to help."
Tom won't be away for long.
Tom never signed up for swimming lessons.
Tom likes to watch TV while he eats.
Don't push your luck.
Would you like ice?
He said that necessity is the mother of invention.
I broke my leg skiing.
You never answered the question.
The yen is expected to lose value against the dollar.
Her books sell pretty well.
I go to bed at ten almost every day.
Can I borrow this?
You must trust in yourselves.
"Unfortunately, the food supplies gave out before the end of winter."
Tom looked wise.
The old man served the king for many years.
My hobby is music.
I'm impressed with your French.
I'm afraid I don't understand that.
Coffee keeps me awake.
Tom looks depressed.
Were you looking for Tom?
That's Tom's car.
Read it to me.
What are you going to give Tom?
I don't know anybody who can speak French.
Tom is excused.
Tom doesn't like kids.
Tom doesn't know Mary's last name.
"Instead of going to school, he stayed at home."
Theory and practice should go hand in hand.
He thinks of nothing but making money.
You're perfect the way you are.
Tom is taller than I am.
It's not too hot.
Everybody has secrets.
You don't have to make a different dish for every person.
The spy made contact with the enemy.
Everybody wished he had been elected governor.
Would you like to go for a walk?
He doesn't show any sign of life.
Do you have everything?
There's no need to wait.
She still loves him.
It's great to see you.
I couldn't have done this without you.
I had no idea you couldn't speak French.
Tom got fatter.
Tom was acquitted.
"As cultural exchange continued between the two countries, their mutual understanding became even deeper."
"There are five items on the tray, three of which are keys."
What is this letter?
It was a true story.
You might be right.
Aren't you going to vote today?
Tom and Mary were kissing each other when I walked in.
Does your throat hurt?
Tom enjoys your company.
Tom is only pretending that he doesn't know.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
The nurse took Tom's temperature.
This vase is fragile.
The girl let the bird loose.
See you Monday at school.
I always liked Tom.
Montgomery was where it all began.
Tom slept on the couch.
You should get your eyes examined by the doctor.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
"You're not going, are you?"
How well did you know Tom?
Could you tell me something about yourself?
It's the same thing.
I'm certain he's coming.
Tom is going bird watching next weekend.
My little sister asked me to teach her how to ski.
They killed time playing cards.
How did you solve the problem?
He was driven by revenge.
Things are not always black and white.
I'd like to see it.
It'll be a long day.
Tom rang his boss to tell him he wouldn't be coming in today.
Tom said it took him a little while to get used to doing this.
Please give me an ashtray.
We flew nonstop from Osaka to Los Angeles.
He is anything but handsome.
He kicked the ball into the goal.
You'll be sorry!
I was caught in a shower on my way to the station.
Tom doesn't know where Mary graduated from.
The earthquake destroyed everything.
What would Tom do if he found out?
Has the snow stopped yet?
Tom likes trying out new things.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
We don't have a lot of trouble.
Tom has called in sick the last three days.
"What makes you happy, Tom?"
I was in such a hurry that I left my bag behind.
Tom seems tired tonight.
I had nothing to say to Tom.
I owe you ten dollars.
You seem very knowledgeable about that.
Tom is in trouble.
I'm happy for both of you.
Tom is the right man for this job.
I've told you everything I remember.
She was all smiles.
I couldn't help crying.
They're eating apples.
He has a hat on.
Your glasses fell on the floor.
Tom is an outlaw.
Don't worry about money so much.
A policeman is outside.
I never meant to put you in any danger.
We were totally exhausted from the five-hour trip.
They sell imported goods at the shop.
"If it hadn't been for the storm, I would've arrived sooner."
Look at me when I talk to you!
This isn't supposed to be happening.
This is too good to be true.
I was the one who stole Mary's diamond ring.
You'll get into trouble if your girlfriend finds out the truth.
Enjoy the show.
Let this smoky air out of the room and let some fresh air in.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license.
Tom saddled and bridled the horse.
It is often easier to make plans than to carry them out.
"If not now, when do you plan to start the project?"
I like it very much.
I'd better go now.
"How about a cup of tea or something, if you aren't in a hurry?"
Let's see what happens.
Tom eats anything that Mary puts on the table.
He's looking for a job.
Who's going to believe that?
We're unusual.
I can teach English.
They teased each other.
How do I know you're not an imposter?
We've run short of oil.
Did you already do your homework?
We adopted a child.
"Someone told me that Albert Einstein said, ""Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen."""
I parked my car next to yours.
We've all become communists.
I've never seen you so nervous.
Please don't play near the railroad tracks.
Tom knows it's true.
Mary is weird.
Tom is fanning himself.
Let Tom do that.
I'll make you breakfast.
I am thrilled to be here.
My father is in his room.
Tom just needs a little rest.
I remember giving him the key.
I don't know anyone in Boston.
I can't believe you actually did that.
I heard him go down the stairs.
I will make up for it next time.
Tom seems determined.
Most Americans do not object to my calling them by their first names.
Will we arrive in time?
I want Tom to be here for Christmas.
"He used to say so, but now he doesn't."
Tom's condition is deteriorating rapidly.
I'm not very athletic.
I caught him trying to sneak out.
Today we'll study Charles Dickens.
Mary is not a huge football fan.
Butter is made from milk.
Tom has a dark complexion.
I looked everywhere.
Don't talk like that.
I read one of his works.
"If you wish to speak to Tom, you'll need to wait about three hours."
You mean a lot to me.
He wrestled his attacker to the ground.
I arrived at the village before dark.
The politician did not bother to apologize for betraying our trust.
Show me what's in your pockets.
I don't understand what you want.
She doesn't need to go there herself.
I'll go get it for you.
I bought it for 10 dollars.
"Tom's eyes weren't yet accustomed to the dark, so he couldn't see a thing."
Some of what you said sounded stupid.
Don't pretend what you don't feel.
Tom and I didn't speak to each other for three years.
My legs ached after the long walk.
He didn't want to disappoint his mother.
Our picnic plates are made of plastic.
He had a shower before breakfast.
What is it now?
"What's that? ""How am I supposed to know?"""
These shoes are not suitable for running.
The mouse ran underneath the bed.
You don't look happy to see me.
A new year always brings hope.
Tom is a close relative of mine.
I'm not asking you. I'm begging you.
This is my final offer.
Tom tossed the book on the couch.
You've got to make sure Tom isn't late for school again.
The audience clapped when the concert was over.
I assume that you've proofread this already.
Tom didn't reply.
I wonder who can swim fastest.
Tom doesn't want to be with us.
Do you think this is interesting?
Are both of you ready to go?
Can you tell me the way to the bank?
Please come.
I hear Tom is getting married.
Say goodbye.
Tom is wicked.
I wanted to learn French.
I get a haircut every month.
I wish I had a room of my own.
"Excuse me, what's the shortest route to the station?"
The paint hasn't dried yet.
Tom was standing by the fence.
You can see some wild rabbits in the forest.
You have to pay in advance.
No one cares about me.
Tom has said he has to do that.
I'd like to say goodbye.
Is there a tour guide available?
Your watch is similar to mine in shape and color.
You can't hurt my feelings.
How do you eat like that and keep your figure?
What should Tom do?
"Come on, wake up."
Don't forget to take out the garbage.
No one loves you like I do.
Tom's been very busy at work and can't get any time off until the week after next.
The inhabitants of the city depend upon the river for drinking water.
Tom could barely hear what Mary was trying to say.
He has been to London three times.
Tom just kept eating.
I acted as a simultaneous interpreter.
He is old enough to tell good from evil.
Are you busy on Sunday afternoon?
"I was born in the north, but now I live in Florida."
I'm not entirely sure.
Tom's family rarely eats together.
He wrote a book about his adventures in the jungle.
Please close the door when you leave.
You've got my computer and I want it back.
He tricked her into agreeing to his proposal.
The kitchen always smells good when Tom is around.
You can get a better look over here.
We can't leave Boston until we finish this job.
We looked for it here and there.
You had better go and speak to him in person.
He gave his camera to his friend.
"I searched for hours, but couldn't find it."
I don't understand what the problem is.
This paint comes off easily.
Please keep this information to yourself.
You'll see Tom.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
Tom tells me he doesn't care whether you like it or not.
Don't worry about the result of your test.
The burglar gained access to the house through an unlocked side window.
How clever!
I need you.
Can you remember the first word you learned in English?
We'll talk about that soon.
Tom fed the pigs.
He has some money in the bank.
Tom said that he needs to learn how to do that.
Tom said that he was innocent.
He has guts.
"To join the choir, you have to be able to read music."
Everything was perfect.
This is non-negotiable.
I'm supposed to see Tom.
When Tom met Mary he knew he'd met the love of his life.
I love my plants.
I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
I wish I'd studied harder when I was young.
She decided to resign.
Tom sounded busy.
Why did Tom come to you?
Have they reported it to the police yet?
You know me better than that.
How deep is it?
Do you eat rice every day?
There must be another way we can help Tom.
She's a night owl.
There was a large crowd in the hall.
She took a taxi to the hospital.
What did you bring me?
Even Tom doesn't do that.
"No matter how hard I try, I can't remember how to do it."
"Although the sun was out, it was cold."
Warm and humid weather increases the number of crimes.
We'll go out.
Where can I get stamps?
Couldn't you go someplace else?
What does it look like to you?
Tom can't have gone to bed yet.
The news of his death spread.
We can't risk it.
I'll rephrase the question.
A cop was killed.
I don't want to call the police.
I sat next to him.
Is Tom aware of what Mary did?
"If you allow me to speak, I'll be able to explain everything."
I may do that.
These glasses are beautiful.
I don't work on Mondays.
Why is Tom so motivated to do that?
Give the keys to Tom.
Tom is at home almost every evening.
Have a nice weekend.
Go and help Tom.
Rice grows in warm climates.
Finishing the job by Tuesday will be a piece of cake.
Don't speak ill of the dead.
I eat bread.
Tom was fighting.
Neither Tom nor Mary can speak French.
Stop complaining and do as you're told.
Do you prefer to go by train or bus?
"After Grandma's sudden death, Grandpa began to age rapidly."
Do you have enough money?
One man's meat is another man's poison.
We share the housework.
A grasshopper and many ants lived in a field.
The sun doesn't shine at night.
We only do what we've been told.
Tom and Mary are playing cards.
"Tom and Mary have a few kids, but I'm not sure how many."
"Look, if you still want to go, I won't stop you."
He has to fix the clock.
I think telling lies is wrong.
I'll help you within the limits of my ability.
I still can't believe it happened.
I won't be able to help you.
A year has twelve months.
Why do you have this?
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
My parents did not raise me very well.
This is just the type of car I want.
I brush my teeth twice a day.
We haven't heard from Tom in a long time.
I worry about the kids.
Did Tom threaten you?
Do you have everything?
Come get it.
You have to respect the old.
Tom and Mary weren't able to do anything.
The store is open from nine to six.
This factory is almost fully automated.
It was so dark.
Tom hasn't even held Mary's hand yet.
Tom had a job interview on Monday.
I hate you all.
Please don't speak so fast.
What you're doing seems way more dangerous than what I'm doing.
I sure hope you're right.
Tom has passed out.
I asked Tom if he could recommend a good lawyer.
Tom is over there standing by the window.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
What do you take me for?
I expect Tom has his reasons for doing that.
The sand on the beach was white.
I was a member of the soccer club when I was in junior high.
I just can't believe Tom and Mary are getting married.
Tom is learning English.
Tom and Mary got married when they were very young.
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
Go that way.
"If you want to become a good writer, you need to practice writing."
I'm still suffering from jet lag.
Tom wrote to Mary this week.
What do you think about the book?
You said that you loved Tom.
This area was first settled by the Dutch more than two hundred years ago.
They both laughed again.
"He isn't coming, either."
Both the boy and the girl are clever.
Do you have tuna fish?
You should eat something.
Ask me if I care.
Tom put a knife to my throat.
I think I should leave.
She ignored all my warnings.
It's surprising how many unhappy marriages there are.
Tom thinks that he's the center of the universe.
I've got my own problems.
Children hate annoying teachers.
Have you seen Tom since he's shaved his head?
Tom and Mary lay down side by side on the grass.
I demanded that he pay the bill immediately.
You've got to make sure Tom isn't late for school again.
Are you sure this is the right train?
I'd rather not discuss it right now.
This tree is bigger than all the others.
The truth finally came out at his trial.
Tom and Mary took turns standing guard.
I didn't ask for these.
You'd better not do it.
"They're yours, Tom."
Luckily nobody drowned.
It's easy for her to make friends.
My younger brother watches TV.
The sirens went off.
We haven't even tried.
He and I are brothers.
Our team is two points ahead.
You must do as I tell you.
I only live here because it's close to where I work.
I have never gone to America.
I can see that you are working.
"He did a lot for his people, but he could have done much more."
"Go to work, Tom."
Make the time to do it.
I don't know where he is now.
No kidding?
He has never come on time that I know of.
My uncle bought me this book.
What time's your train?
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
She could not come because she was ill.
This medicine has no harmful side effects.
I like the name Tom. It has a nice ring to it.
We are happy to see you again.
"I had an appointment at 2:30, but I got caught in traffic and couldn't get there in time."
Have you ever plucked a chicken?
Air quality has deteriorated these past few years.
What does the doctor think is wrong with Tom?
Tom told me that he could come on any day but Tuesday.
What are your orders?
She studies mathematics.
Tom goofed.
I have to do my best.
Where does this book go?
You don't have to wrap it up.
I have to unpack my suitcases.
That's just absolutely ridiculous.
Thank you for helping us solve the problem.
When was the last time you ironed your clothes?
What a beautiful morning!
He took something out of his pocket.
Tom came to Boston in 2001.
Where's my suitcase?
Respect yourself.
Don't deceive me.
I can carry that.
What are you guys planning?
The children were well looked after.
Tom will protect you.
You have no one but yourself to blame.
This is my alarm clock.
I've failed.
I won't make you do anything you don't want to.
I do that at least once a day.
I want to be famous.
Tom sure spends a lot of time at Mary's house.
He only speaks one language.
It's conceivable.
We saw a boy run over by a truck.
We're not like that.
OK. I agree.
You're not Canadian.
It happened by accident.
You're late again.
Don't forget to take an umbrella in case it rains.
I came back home late.
Tom wants to study in Boston.
His name is on the tip of my tongue.
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
He told me to meet him at 1 o'clock at the airport.
We don't need to do that now.
She has good control over her class.
We are blinking our eyes.
He's been doing this for over twenty years.
We're going to Boston to see Tom.
He passed away quite suddenly.
I must admit that I've never heard of it.
You've often said so yourself.
We have to be tough sometimes.
How long have you been in town?
The meeting broke up at seven.
Thank you for bringing that up.
Why did you go to Tokyo?
It won't be that hard.
"Let me off at the train station, please."
I was born and brought up in Matsuyama.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I know why you're not happy.
"Can I see your license, please?"
He rarely gives up.
I'm looking for my hat.
"I waited for an hour, but he didn't appear."
The boy doesn't know how to behave.
Tom looked outside.
We're moving in next door.
I never thought I'd be this busy.
"At the meeting, we came up with a lot of new ideas."
Is it too early to call Tom?
Is there a paperback edition of this book?
My father is out in the garden now.
I think married people have more problems than single people.
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence.
"We have considered your proposal, and we have decided that we are not able to reduce the price."
You are mistaken about that.
Stay down!
It looks like you've already been replaced.
I am studying Chinese and Spanish.
Tom always gets to work on time.
Tom changes his mind a lot.
I cried today.
"To the best of my knowledge, he will not come."
They wash their hands.
Tom doesn't understand that.
Tom took the hook out of the fish's mouth.
Tom has yogurt topped with slivered almonds for breakfast.
He came to my house on the pretext of seeing me.
Sit down and shut up.
Tom is a friend of my dad's.
Tom and Mary want to see us.
This is the fish he caught.
Don't tell my wife.
They no longer felt a need to protest.
We had to shut the window because of the mosquitoes.
He is about my age.
You're a good girl.
Earthquakes are common in Japan.
I'm full of good ideas.
You are holding my hand in that picture.
Bring the rest of your luggage with you.
Tom did it simply for the money.
That sounds a lot easier to do than it is.
This book is worth reading.
Are you going to the class reunion?
The waiter did his best to please the customers.
Tom's lying.
I had to go to America.
Tom thinks that's true.
Tom prefers speaking French.
Tom came at an inopportune time.
You should leave it for tomorrow.
Those are empty words.
Do you want to go to Boston with me?
You don't know how much I love you.
"When Tom works outside in the winter, he usually wears long johns."
It seems that you're very busy today.
Few scientists understand the theory of relativity.
Did you speak with Tom?
What Tom really wanted was some time with his children.
I wasn't the one who wrote this letter.
Is there anything special I can do for you?
You've won!
Tom just got a haircut.
Books are to the mind what food is to the body.
I fully agree with you.
You've made a huge mistake.
You'd better not go out today.
The baby cried on and off all night.
It won't happen unless you make it happen.
Everybody looked up.
He was given up for dead.
Let me see that list.

Where is the bank?
I have a new red car.
Your lawyers want to see you.

This rose is beautiful.
I'm going to need at least five minutes.
I put the money into the safe.
"Reading between the lines, it's clear that Tom isn't having such a good time in his new job."
Do you really think that's fair?
Do you like playing volleyball?
Speak more slowly so that we can understand you.
I'd like two cans of tomatoes.
Tom has been dead for three years.
You're kidding me.
What else did Tom eat?
"She is beautiful, no matter what she wears."
She cried for joy when she heard that her son had survived the plane crash.
Are you envious?
Could you go there and get it?
She became a singer.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
He admitted his mistakes.
It was a pity that Tom couldn't come to our party.
I don't think he can handle the truth.
This isn't worth getting worked up over.
I like what you've written.
What frightened Tom?
Leave the driving to me.
Please tell me your address.
They visited me occasionally.
You need not do it at once.
"I, too, am worried about Tom."
This is very bad.
He has a small advantage.
Tom was in a bad mood.
I want to go outside for a breath of fresh air.
I began driving our tractor when I was 12 years old to help my father out at harvest time.
Are you generous?
Is there some other place you'd rather be?
Where is the mailbox?
Tom disappointed me.
You can't make me love you.
That's terrible.
Tom pulled out a sandwich from a brown paper bag.
Tom knew what Mary was planning to do.
I can't use a fork well.
He stole my watch.
"Tom is very sharp, isn't he?"
"To tell the truth, I didn't do my homework."

Tom was born into a poor family.
Have you ever been to Disneyland?
"Waste not, want not."
He lost his balance and fell off the ladder.
I can't explain the difference between the two.
Election day was cold and rainy.
I tried to be like you.
She is a famous singer.
Tom hasn't been living here long.
Tom hasn't been here in a long time.
She prefers beer to wine.
How do I do that?
"If you wash it, your car will shine in the sun."
"It's not ideal, but it's the least unsatisfactory solution."
We're very happy for you.
"After lunch today, our plan is to take a walk in the park."
Tom wants popcorn.
I admit it.
There was nothing in the box.
Tom says it's an emergency.
Tom seems dazed.
Tom and Mary sat across from each other at a table in the corner.
Don't park here.
What about your wife?
Stop talking and get back to work.
All men are equal.
Tom filled his glass and then filled one for Mary.
Are you ready to eat?
Get on the horse.
I'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
He gave me a smile of recognition.
The meeting ended at 4:00 p.m.
Ring the bell when you want me.
I am quite comfortable in this room.
I hope that you will like it.
The twin brothers look exactly alike.
I'm looking forward to summer vacation.
I have neither seen nor heard of such a thing.
I rode my bicycle to the store.
Circumstances have changed.
"Is this to eat here, or to go?"
I trust you have no complaints.
He has made a big improvement in tennis.
Did Tom contact you?
"There's still a lot left to do, so I won't get bored."
He didn't even say goodbye.
The rain prevented me from going.
There's nothing Tom hates more than lying.
I can't speak French as well as Tom.
I'll ask Tom to teach me how to drive.
Tom was awarded a research grant by the National Science Foundation.
How are you going to spend your weekend?
I'm too busy to talk to you now.
I wanted to spare your feelings.
Tom said he thought I was dead.
Is there enough money to get a bottle of wine?
She continued with the work.
"You're the expert, Tom."
No one's going to judge you.
I took it for granted that she would come.
Everything is extremely simple.
Let's hope that common sense prevails.
Could you do me a favor?
I just want a little more sleep.
I'll never leave you.
Can you do bookkeeping?
We bought some vegetables and fish at the market.
Do you have any idea who would do this?
I know exactly what you're feeling.
Tom and Mary are running a little behind schedule.
I have to check my mailbox.
Call Tom and tell him to come here.
Tom read about Mary's accident in the newspaper.
The first thing I want to do tomorrow is to find a good part-time job.
Where's my beer?
She sent me a postcard that said she hates the smell of animals.
Ask the waitress for the menu.
"Yes, someone actually said that."
Why do you want to die?
Tom is trying to do just that.
Tell Tom I don't have his keys.
Tom visited Australia.
You were never here when I needed you.
I didn't touch anything.
We are sorry we can't help you.
This town hasn't changed a bit since the 1970's.
It's a pity you destroyed everything.
"If I can do it, so can you."
"Could you pass me the salt, please?"
Would you mind if I ask you a few questions?
The result will satisfy him.
You will be laughed at.
"Turn down the volume, please."
What other options do I have?
This is the watch that I bought yesterday.
I'll walk you back to your hotel.
It has been the driest June for thirty years.
Shouldn't we be wearing hard hats?
I have a job that pays well.
Let me do my job.
He hasn't written to them in a long time.
Tom buried his face in his hands.
We must provide for our old age.
We can do without that.
What is he like?
He passed by without looking at me.
How may I help you?
It's not anybody's fault.
They kept him waiting outside for a long time.
A true scientist would not think like that.
How could you be so cruel?
Neither of them was ever heard of again.
I'll take care of your kitten while you're away.

I don't need a history lesson.
It can't be!
Tell me the reason why they are absent.
Tom is usually home on Mondays.
Tom is in the kitchen making tea.
"The longer you live, the older you get."
Look at what you've become.
Tom is doing very well.
Do not oversleep tomorrow morning.
I wash my hair every time I take a shower.
You have no right to tell me what to do.
He wants to go.
You'll never guess what happened.
Put this Japanese into English.
Did you go to see a doctor?
"I have read both of these books, but neither of them is interesting."
"As far as politics is concerned, he's still as innocent as a child."
"Do not fear the unexpected, but be prepared for it."

Have a nice evening.
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours.

How did you know that he is married?
It was a very big room.
You're just as annoying as you were the last time I met you.
We're doing it together.
The blue sky seemed to stretch forever.
Why wait for Christmas?
Who's picking up the tab?
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while.
My ancestors hoped to find political asylum.
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
These people are anything but innocent.
I'm not complaining.
Who invented karaoke?
She grew up to be a great scientist.
One cannot erase the past.
You've misunderstood.
Get my tool box.
What's with Tom?
Tom was sleepy.
It's not going to end well.
Did you make the train?
I hate the winter.
When are you going to get married?
How barbaric!
Don't call me anymore.
I will speak with you tomorrow.
Tom and I don't do that.
I'll let you know when it's done.
We sell sugar by the pound.
Tom flew to Boston yesterday.
This is a very common injury.
That's a beautiful flower arrangement.
I'm leaving today.
Aren't you happy about this?
Ask your question.
Do you think Mary is attractive?
Don't overexert yourself.
How do you like your new apartment?
Is there any possibility that he'll win the election?
"We don't have a lot of money, but we have enough to buy what we absolutely need."
Do you know who she is?
Tom won't deal.
He ran.
Tom has a lot of friends to help him.
Please don't change anything.
We miss you a lot.
She is a poor cook.
It works well.
I know someone who speaks French well.

We're here to help them.
It's neither good nor bad.
Tom walked in carrying more supplies.
Tom has been in Boston for a week.
Do you think Tom and Mary go to the same school?

You must go at once.
You'd better not do anything like that again.
Her behavior isn't normal for a young girl.
Are you good at cooking?
I'm glad to be here.
We should try to understand each other.
This is one of Tom's favorite quotes.
I remember reading about it.
Tom delivers newspapers.
Tom didn't mind living by himself.
The ticket is valid to April 29.

I feel my age.
Will that ever change?
The people pushed their way in.

Always be true to yourself.
I will not let you do it.
Do you find that amusing?
Close your eyes and go to sleep.
I'm afraid I must say goodbye.
He earns twice my salary.
I'll have something for you soon.
What did Tom just say to you?
The fires got out of control.
Give me a kiss.
Try to learn a little French.
Tom asked Mary to tell him about the house she had lived in when she was a child.
Why do I have to talk to Tom?
Can we afford this?
That's not how the world works.
The door will not open.
Has something happened?
We have to operate immediately.
Speaking French is very difficult for me.
I've lost it.
He does nothing but read books all day long.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
I was captured.
He behaved as if he were crazy.
Tell me what you're thinking.

I'll miss that.

You're the only one who can help me.
Do you want your whiskey straight or should I mix it with water?
He doesn't need to get up so early.
"Finally, I found a job."
I want Tom to succeed.
I telephoned her at once.
Tom seems to know his stuff.
Nobody can help you.
Tom was amusing.
You're not poor.
That's not interesting.
Tom sharpened the knife.
People who break the law are punished.
It's half past eight.
Tom's ploy almost suceeded.
She stabbed him.
Aren't you going in?
Tom is just visiting.
Tom followed Mary out into the hall.
I am taking a bath now.
I'm really sorry about that.
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I hope you had a good night's sleep.
This place is nice and quiet.
I crossed the street.
Tom is doing his homework.
Tom was looking for something to eat.
Tom has a good head on his shoulders.
It's getting darker outside now.
"By the way, have you heard from him lately?"

Tom filled the pitcher with water.
"Seen from a distance, the big rock looks like an old castle."
Tom told me that Mary had been injured in a traffic accident.

Let me know what I can do to help.
We could see what we thought was a pirate ship in the distance.
We're not about to give up.

Tom sat down on the couch beside Mary.
Don't raise my hopes like that.
Tom got married to Mary.
Tom gave thanks to God.
It's going to rain soon.
You're drinking out of my cup.
This coat fits me very well.
Tom asked Mary how much money she had.
Is this love?
How do you pronounce this?
She wants an iPad 4.
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
The answer is actually quite simple.
Beware of pickpockets.
"Before I went to bed, I set the alarm clock for seven."
There is nothing to do today.
What's the title of the book you're reading?
Are you happy with how you look?
I'm going up the stairs.
Tom said he wished that he hadn't told Mary to try to convince John to do that.
We can't predict what'll happen.
Tom can't work tonight.
Wait till I put on my coat.
Tom can play the piano much better than me.
It's a typo. Sorry.
The food supplies will not hold out till then.
Come along.
Let me know if you need anything.
You can't seat Tom next to Mary.
He is skating.
About 80 million bacteria are transferred during a 10 second kiss.
I missed my connecting flight.
We don't want you here.
He drinks a glass of water every morning.
That boy has black hair.
I wonder whether Tom is as old as Mary.
Did you leave the door open?
What time do you usually have breakfast?
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
"Tom calculated that he had given Mary over 34,000 dollars in the past six months."
You have no cause for anger.
I thought you'd left.
You can't give up hope.
I received your message yesterday.
Could you pass me the salt?
We can't turn back.
She likes to dress in an old-fashioned way.
A dog will bark at strangers.
"It may be impossible to get a completely error-free corpus due to the nature of this kind of collaborative effort. However, if we encourage members to contribute sentences in their own languages rather than experiment in languages they are learning, we might be able to minimize errors."
Is this why you hired me?
Tom is an easy guy to dislike.
They say that he was very poor when he was young.
That comedian is very funny.
No one will believe them.
"You're right, I'm sorry."
Do you think he resembles his father?
There are around three thousand mosques in Istanbul.
Have you written your report?
Tom didn't say anything about that in his letter.
There's a fine line between bravery and stupidity.
Try to concentrate.
Can you pick me up at the station?
Tom can't do this.
Tom likes taking walks by himself.
Tom is big.
Our farm is located in rural Nebraska.

He doesn't want to get involved.
Please be honest.
I'm on my way.

He came back at 5 o'clock.
He must be nearly forty.
Tom is the main character.
I like the simplicity of her dress.
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you were the one who killed his father?
What on earth is this?
"Tom says he never lies to Mary, but he often does."
I received a letter three months later.
"They seized him and took him to Fort Monroe, Virginia."
I'm a little early.
I can't wait that long.
Many obstacles were put in Tom's way.

Tom has a meeting every Monday afternoon.
There always seems like there is something to do.
Why are you mad?
It hurts here.
"Tom walked into the room, followed by John and Mary."
Why is snow white?
She does not want to be dependent on her parents.
They rushed to the scene of the traffic accident.
Many trees lose their leaves in the winter.
You don't have to tell it to me if you don't want to.
Why are you so worried?
Can Tom be counted upon?
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
I'd like a little bit of cake.
He is afraid that he will die.
The noise is getting louder and louder.
I'd like you to stop.
He will be a good teacher.
He needed the money.
Is it really important to you why I quit smoking?
They attributed the low death rate of infants to the progress of medicine.
May I borrow your bike?
Do you have any quarters?
She was always trying to provoke me into saying something I would regret later.
"I don't care if the early bird gets the worm, I want to sleep."
I heard that you share an apartment with Tom.
Don't be so hard on Tom. He meant well.
How can I get there?
She has a good figure.
She's forgotten how to do it.
We were eighteen at that time.
People like to talk.
I'll take it up with Tom.
She invited him to her party.
Tom and Mary have the same opinion.
You were always too busy to talk to me.
Our professor postponed the exam until next week.
Tom will start.
I come to Australia twice a year.
Turn the volume up.
Let me go and buy some bread.
Tom made cookies.
What is it?

That fox must have killed the hen.
There's something I need to talk with you about.
What school did you go to?
This is my school.
"Come what may, I won't change my opinion."
We depend on each other.
She locked the door.
You're too young to travel by yourself.
"The barn was small, but it was strong."
I'll be good.
Tom's house is only three blocks away from here.
That's not going to stop me.
Tom seems like a great guy.
Is that all you have to say to me?
"If you push this button, the door will open."
"You're my best friend, Tom."
We will soon take off.
My answer is still yes.
We made it.
She put her head out of the window.
You can't expect Tom to care about it the way you do.
He got hoarse from so much shouting.
Nobody wants you to do that.
It's popular in China.
That should make you happy.
You're incredible.
"Your name is Tom, correct?"
Tom left home in a hurry.
The museum is open to the public.
She would have failed without his help.
"If something goes wrong, you should take care of it at once."
Tom was special.
I don't think that's even possible.
He was foolish enough to believe what she said.
We don't have a choice. We have to do this.
I will give her the book tomorrow.
Young people tend to take things too far.
What has he done to you?
We're horrible.
When did he go?
Tom wants to change the world.
This wasn't my mistake.
What happened to you? You look miserable.
I'm taking this one.
It was hot last night.
Tom helped Mary get back on her feet.
You don't have to say a word.
Do you have a spare key?
It was really cheap.
We have to stay here until Tom gets back.
The news is too good to be true.
I can't do this work alone.
Why don't you return to your quarters?
I'm not as brave as Tom.
This bed is too hard to sleep in.
Tom and Mary are playing Uno.
The road was clear of traffic.
All you can do is trust one another.
Tom wants to kiss Mary at midnight.
Tom has rejected our offer.
Tom will probably buy his mother some flowers for Mother's Day.
I never even noticed I'd lost my wallet until I got home.
He knows how to tell jokes.
I can't risk that.
I don't know what that thing is.
We can't help you unless you help us.
I hope Tom appreciates it.
You don't have a chance.
She is willing to do anything for me.
I don't know why I did that.
I'm not doing great.
Tom didn't care how it got done as long as it got done.
They look very tired.
What an attractive woman!
I had never been on a plane before.
I don't want to work.
I'm the man of the house.
Did you consider other alternatives?

This one has a lot of advantages over that one.
London is their second home.
I usually eat alone.
The family had a hard time after the war.
You'll have to go to Boston to meet Tom next week.
She insisted on her innocence.
You are as tall as I am.
He ran as fast as he could.
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
I knew you'd be here.
He's nervous and gets scared easily.
Do you have a dog?
I caught the flu.
"When I was a little boy, my father and I went to Boston to visit my great-grandfather."
Have you finished reading the book?
There were many people in the hall.
We don't have any proof.
He knows how to fish with a fishing rod.
Turn it up.
What girl are you talking about?
You don't work here.
I don't love you anymore.
We reached our goal.
Would you like for me to make you something to eat?
This sure tastes good!
No one was watching us.
Who wrote this poem?
Tom is going to need your help.
Tom taught me a lot of things.
There were many snow storms last winter.

It will not be long before man can travel to the moon.
We'll be broke soon if we don't stop spending money on things we don't need.
What surprised me was that Tom didn't know Mary.
Tomorrow is payday.
No one else knows it.
Are you speaking to me?
Is it new?
Who scolded Tom?
"She deposits 10,000 yen in the bank every month."
He always tells vulgar jokes.
Let's go to Boston together.
I'm surprised you didn't bring Tom along.
Tom thought he was better at French than he really was.
You're better at this than I am.
The doctors wore white masks over their mouths and noses.
"Tom is a good student, isn't he?"
This paragraph is vague.
Tom gave half his money to charity.
Time to get up.
He doesn't come here every day.
May I begin?
He committed a serious crime.
Many men were badly wounded in the battle.
We expect good results.
It looks like you're thinking about something else.
"Look at the blackboard, everyone."
"As long as you keep quiet, you can stay in this room."
I am ready.
I have to put a stamp on the envelope.
I have no time to engage in gossip.
Tom asked if I'd found my key.
I suppose you're hungry.
I paid 800 yen for this book.

Is that clock going?
Let's do the work.
I have to keep my mind on this important question.
Let me take your temperature.
Dad's working.
She is awkward.
He is used to the work.
"That's your answer for everything, isn't it?"
The airplane flies at a speed of five hundred kilometers per hour.
We have no information about what's going to happen.
He turns up his nose at everything.
That's a bad sign.
I didn't think Tom was in Boston.
Where are you bound?
I'll call you in a week.
Let's go and see Tom.
What have you done with my luggage?
You can't believe anything that guy says.
"I thought about throwing it away, but decided to keep it."
Would you like me to carry your suitcase for you?
You look so pale today.
It sounds like you want to be alone.
I think you're pretty.
I'd like to have this film processed.
I hope you're doing well.
Tom isn't back yet.
He wrote the report.
I'll know what to do.
She is smarter than he is.
Tom is needy.
He's losing his looks.
He arrived safely.
Tom said that he loved Mary.
The road is blocked because of an accident.
We do need your advice.
What's his track record like?
Tom needs to follow my advice.
They're looking for you.
It's a pity we can't stay.
Having a few extra batteries handy is never a bad idea.
She pretended not to hear him.
I know where you live.
I am very busy these days.
This kind of work requires a lot of patience.
He turned up half an hour late.
Tom said he liked my idea.
Tom was my teacher.
Tom is stronger than you.
I needed time to think.
You're not Canadian.
Everyone is saying goodbye to Tom.
I tried hard.
The flight was cancelled because of the thick fog.
I'm familiar with the situation.
If I'd only taken your advice!
"It's wrong to deceive people, but worse to deceive yourself."
"Asked if he was happy, Tom said that he was."
How long have you known Tom?
Don't push your luck.
I helped my father water the flowers.
Please speak as clearly as possible.
It's getting worse.
I think that Tom and Mary aren't biased.
Everyone hates me.
I broke my leg in a traffic accident.
He was naive.
He does not come here every day.
She was busy with housework.
Tom didn't even try to understand.
The meeting will be held this afternoon.
Tom likes reading books.
Mathematics was his weakest subject in school.
You're not going to the picnic and that's final.
They are looking for chairs to sit on.
Tom had many good ideas.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
I don't quite know what to say.
It doesn't look like Tom's around at the moment.
Don't make so much noise.
Where is the nearest shop?
What do you have for breakfast?
Don't leave everything to chance.
Tom is in there.
I'll be sixteen years old next month.
Tom took off his shirt and threw it into the washing machine.
This is strictly a private matter.
"I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
"Had she been a friend of mine, I would have advised her not to do that."
It was very confusing.
"Memorizing the order of a deck of playing cards is definitely not easy, but it's not impossible."
Tom could refuse.
I've heard worse.
What's that got to do with you?
We're the same age.
Aren't you dressed yet?
Such a ridiculous superstition no longer exists.
Can you please repeat the question?
We went for a walk on the beach.
You are a genius.
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go outside and play.
I hear a lot of girls wear bikinis at that beach.
Is it OK if I go home now?
Who's your favorite painter?
My mother put clean sheets on the bed.
I figured that you wouldn't want to go there without me.
You have no idea what this means to me.
I don't do that as often as Tom does.
Where did you get your camera repaired?
Are you still in love with Tom?
He still has a white vest.
Who's your teacher?
Mary likes to talk to strangers online.
Tom giggled like a schoolgirl.
I'm wearing a sweater because I feel cold.
That's up to Tom.
I'm sorry I was so rude.
She's very wise.
"I owe him 1,000 dollars."
I will postpone my trip to Scotland until it is warmer.
Can it wait?
It doesn't bother me to walk in the rain.
Tom loves to run.
She killed an hour looking around the stores.
"A few years ago, on Mother's Day, I gave my stepmother a locket as a present."
Are you the new teacher?
He glanced over the newspaper before turning in.
He denies himself nothing.
Are you gonna pay for it?
He has blond hair.
I gave him all the money I had.
All drugs of addiction increase the release of dopamine in the brain.
We have everything here that we need.
She testified against him.
We're expecting a good harvest this year.
You can't leave me here alone.
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
Tom had nothing to read.
How will you stop me?
Did you go out last night?
That's very big.
What does Tom think about all this?
I think he'll come.
What's in it for you?
I'm not a little girl anymore.
"Isn't that your car, Tom?"
Tom reads almost no books at all.
I was filled with joy.
Turn off the television. I can't concentrate.
I need new pants.
Let Tom finish what he started.
I saw Tom jump into the pool.
That's not nice.
I said take it.
That really was a stupid thing to do.
Has Tom arrived?
I had the same problem as you.
Tom sat watching TV.
It gets cold here at this time of the year.
The snow is great.
Everyone seems to be happy but me.
He ran outside naked.
The effect was immediate.
She refused to accept the money.
She handed me a sheet of paper.
Take care when you cross the street.
Why didn't you just do what you said you'd do?
This clock is accurate.
I can't believe Tom remembered me.
"When I heard the news, I cried."
Have you traveled anywhere recently?
It is impossible to put the plan into practice.
I drank too much and the ground seemed to spin under my feet.
We'd like separate checks.
It has to be true.
I have things to do tomorrow.
He mistook me for my mother.
I should tell Tom I want to find another job.
I can't finish this today.
I've worked with Tom before.
I'm not in any hurry.
Didn't you know I used to live in Boston?
I thought a lot about what Tom said.
She found it was difficult to adapt herself to her new surroundings.
The answer to this question is simple.
She's unconscious.
Tom collected his things and left the room.
You don't need to go there.
Did Tom fall?
I wish you weren't always so busy.
I'm not taking the bus.
Of course I believe you.
I can't stand it.
Accidents have increased in number.
I have something personal to discuss with you.
Tom warned me of the danger.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
What do people eat in Egypt?
"Which do you prefer, rice or bread?"
Tom left a message on my answering machine.
Tom seems really annoyed.
Tom told Mary it wouldn't be easy.
I told you I don't want your help.
Tom said that.
This is a four-way stop.
Tom is making us do this.
Tom is a good-looking boy.
History is more complex than you think.
The man speaks English with a German accent.
Who will foot the bill?
My brother is healthy.
"Since Tom is leaving for Boston tomorrow, today is our last chance to give this to him."
I caught a beautiful butterfly.
Tom likes popcorn.
He will come back at four.
Mary is a midwife.
Have you ever eaten in a restaurant alone?
I can't get Tom to slow down.
Did you call him up yesterday?
That's not advisable.
I've never told anyone about this.
I must obey Tom.
He is out of the office.
The company has sent several representatives to discuss the matter.
Was it really that bad?
Where is my seat?
I bought this watch at the store.
Is this sterling silver?
What I need is a beer.
Where should I put my suitcase?
I saw Tom running down the street.
He knows how to come to Tokyo.
England is going to win the race.
Listen to your father.
They sat down by the fire.
Actions speak louder than words.
I wondered why people stared at me.
He behaved himself like a man.
I got married.
I'm going to come.
Dublin is my favorite town.
Tom speaks three languages.
Tom was careful.
You should stay away from people like that.
Sheep provide us with wool.
"You can say anything you want about me, but don't say anything bad about Tom."
Tom ripped me off.
Why is that?
Tom braided Mary's hair for her.
Tom walked away.
Did you enjoy your holiday?
The birds were flying in a group.
Where did you get all this from?
He has sharp hearing.
Is that what you're afraid of?
"Tom followed Mary into the kitchen, picked up a knife and threatened her with it."
I don't have time to explain it now.
My family is very important to me.
Tom's dad is a university professor.
We want to go.
There were some muddy footprints on the floor.
Not a single star could be seen in the sky.
Come in.
Never tell a lie!
What's this about?
Tom didn't show up for work yesterday.
I need some time to think about it.
She went to the door to welcome her friends.
Add more water to it.
They cleared the pavement of snow.
Tom is so irresponsible. I can't believe it.
Glad to see you again.
That article makes fun of vegetarians.
Tom said he didn't know what was wrong.
You sound like your mother.
Happy Easter!

I can't speak Japanese.
Who's volunteering?
Where are your people?
"I was born in Barcelona on March 23, 1969."
Do you believe that women have a sixth sense?
Tom and Mary know about it.
I used to enjoy playing tennis with Tom.
Be quiet. Don't talk in the theater.
You were wise not to follow his advice.
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
"If you see or hear anything, let me know."
Tom said he couldn't do that.
"I'd like to help, but I can't."
He's not in.
She is obedient to her parents.
I think that you're right.
Enjoy yourselves.
I know you miss Tom.
The weatherman says a storm is coming.
I love games.
Tom doesn't like that woman.
Isn't it about time you went to bed?
Don't go to Boston.
Do you understand the difference?
I was chilled to the bone.
Tom put the ring on Mary's finger.
What browser are you using?
Tom asked Mary out.
She knows everything about cooking.
I usually keep a diary when I travel.
Tom has no right to give me orders.

Every dog has his day.
Tom kind of looks like John.
There are sentences which everybody knows.
Tom is too young to apply for the job.
I saw him enter the room.
I like to study English.
We've hired Tom.
"Tom didn't know the meaning of ""anglophobia,"" so he did a quick web search to see if he could find out what it meant."

A lot of people look up to you. Don't let them down.
I have some rather bad news.
I couldn't attend that party because I was sick.
Do you think Tom is really sorry?
That could come in handy.
"Don't come late, okay?"
Can we do this later?
May the new year bring you happiness!
I didn't go out last Sunday.
Tell me everything you know.
Take everything.

Which do you suppose she chose?

He and I can not speak Spanish.

We demanded that she should make up for the loss.
They found gunshot residue on the victim's hand.

Be quiet while I'm speaking.
I think you can help us.

I've studied French for years.
Some people never learn.
Tom knows where you are.
I have a friend who went to school with Tom.
I worked in a post office during the summer vacation.
Tom talked to me about his plans.
I thought Tom had already tried to do that.
Are you a good dancer?
My family is from Malaysia.
Would you mind telling me why you're here?
