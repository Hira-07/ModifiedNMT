Your drinking is starting to affect the performance of your duties.
Excuse me for being late.
We cannot do the work in a day.
Today I want to eat something light.
Tom looks furious.
He's not in.
I'm glad you were there.
Perhaps you'll reconsider.
Rural environments are too quiet for me.
Tom had nothing left to eat.
You're no younger than I am.
We probably shouldn't have done that.
I changed my mind.

I'm not an artist.
I haven't had time to look for what you wanted.
Delete his name from the list.

Did you say something?
"When you're in a hurry, it's easy to make a mistake."
There were toys scattered all over the floor.
"You are a schoolteacher, aren't you?"

What's the fax number for this hotel?
I will come to see you next Sunday.
It is not as good as it looks.
He had a certain charm.
Earth is a beautiful planet.
Tom needs to help Mary more than he does.
Tom isn't familiar with that subject.
"So, have you thought about my offer?"
It's nice to have friends.
I have no friends.
He stopped reading a book.
She's still young.
I requested extra salt on my French fries.
She wanted me to come.
Tom doesn't want Mary to go to Boston with him.
This is his house.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I take a walk every day except when it rains.
I must find out.
Tom said that he hated Mary.
We stayed at a cheap hotel.
I don't know if we can do that without Tom's permission.

She has twice as many books as he has.

Are you feeling better today?
These are Mary's earrings.
Tom vowed he'd never do it.
The difference in their ages is six years.
You're carrying this too far.
I'm cold. May I close the window?
"If he should arrive late, you may start the conference without him."
That doesn't look too hard.
Fill it up.

She showed him the photo.
I'd like to talk to you.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
Did you turn the stove off?
You can do it.
It's a joke.
One of the apples fell to the ground.
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Stop being so nice.
The idea isn't bad.
Which countries have you visited?
The mic is yours.
I forced myself to stay awake.
Tom took a step forward.
That's not good for your health.
Would you mind leaving us alone for a minute?

We're just trying to help you.
She watched him swim.
He came down the hill on his bicycle.
You've been really helpful.
We knew you'd come.
Did it not occur to you to close the windows?
There's very little we can do now.
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
Where did you go last weekend?
I wasn't too sure about it.
Give Tom everything he asks for.
Tom seems mean.
You must help set the table.
I am well acquainted with the subject.
They leaned out of the window to watch the parade.
Women are beautiful.
I think I'll be able to fix it.
The present government has many problems.
It's much too cold to swim.
It is entirely up to him whether he does it or not.
I don't know who started that rumor.
I'd like you to meet my sister.
I'll show you how to do it.
I'm going to shoot him dead.
Don't raise my hopes like that.
Tom should be able to stop this.
I'm going to stay home tonight.
I won't be a party to this.
Can I tempt you to try another piece of cake?
I'm not really hungry.
She knows how to do the crawl.
Is there a gas station around here?
I'm sorry I don't have my watch with me.
Tom spared no expense.
I don't believe you. You're always telling lies.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
You aren't Canadian.

It looks like the wind's getting stronger.
"When I arrived, they quickly cleared out of the house."
We were greeted by a cute waitress.
Who did it?
You're not Canadian.
I should call a doctor.
You've drunk three cups of coffee.
"Whose sheep are these? ""They are mine."""
I believe you have my umbrella.
I've danced so much that I'm dizzy.
Time is running out.
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.

Would you like some more orange juice?
He wiped the sweat off his face.
Tom and Mary seem to be in love with each other.
There were more spectators than I had expected.
I met him on the street by chance.
I have simply nothing to say about it.
We can't fight here.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Tom urged Mary to be more careful.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
Do you think we have any chance of winning?
Strawberries are in season now.
I'll stay a while longer if you want me to.
We don't know what they want to use it for.

Does he live near here?
What are we doing today?

How was that decision made?
"Tom is now on his own, isn't he?"
I have a horse.
I was offered the choice of tea or coffee.
You've done a lot of good.
How can I prove my innocence?
What are friends for?

My computer won't start up anymore.
He's giving it a go.
I assume you've proofread this already.
Is the bath ready?
You may choose what to eat from this list.
Sorry about that.

I'm as tall as he is.
I am painting the garage.
You've done it!
Do you have time to help me?
When is your next train for Boston?

That noise distracts me.
I apologize for what's happened here.
Tom ignored the remark.
I'll come home.

That's a hard question to answer.
She's waiting for you at home.
Tom claimed that Mary shot him.
"Lemon tea without sugar, please."

What for?

What do you call this?
That was a dirty trick.
I hope to see you tomorrow.
I couldn't help it.
I didn't do anything bad.
I object to her going there alone.
It would probably be a good idea.
Tom spilled his drink.
You are a very patient teacher.
"I'm only going to say this once, so listen carefully."
I've known that a long time.

Try this on. It should fit you.
Mary filed her nails.
Tom is vulnerable.
They live there.
The audience applauded for a full five minutes.

It is very kind of you to help me.
I know who my enemy is.
What're we going to do?
I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
The beer's very cold.
How did you manage to do that?
They're painting the fence tomorrow.
Tell Tom that I'm too tired to help him.
His intelligence and experience enabled him to deal with the trouble.

He caught the chicken.
She was unconscious of her mistake.
I want answers to my questions.
He doesn't have any pets.
You should've let me help you.
He was great.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

We lost our way in the woods.

Are you here?
Tom is beginning to get discouraged.
I keep forgetting to cut my toe nails.

Don't forget to spend a little time looking over your notes before the exam.
Think about it.

I saw many birds yesterday morning.
Six men came forward to volunteer for the work.
He ordered me to leave the room at once.

He is anything but a fool.
Don't think about it. Do it.
Sometimes it's hard to be tactful and honest at the same time.
Will you take care of the children while I'm out?
I thought that you had already eaten.
That's the reason he became angry.
Do you know how much it costs?
Shame on you!
What gives?
I told you so.
Look what I found in the garden.
Tom is still downstairs.
And just who might you be?
That's exactly the point.
Do you recognize this handwriting?
She gripped my arm tightly.
I'll give you this.
Tom was distracted and fidgety and Mary knew there was something bothering him.
That's a pathetic excuse.
I was lost in the crowd.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
I don't want to make you angry.
Don't think about it. Do it.
Tom forced a smile.
Tom opened the passenger door for Mary.
Tom can sleep in my room.
Tom didn't show up for work yesterday.
Tom picked up the glass of water and took a sip.
Didn't I tell you so?
Will you translate this into French?

He is always forgetting things.
We have to buy it from abroad.

Do what you like.
May I suggest another solution?
I'll ask around and tell you if I find out anything.
I don't wash my hair every day.
I haven't worked for years.
We can't stay here. The roof is about to collapse!
Tom is the type of person who likes to argue just for the sake of arguing.
I can't control what happens.
You just made me smile.
Rest assured that I will do my best.
Could you please translate this for me?
Tom wanted an apology.
Tom is either an idiot or a genius.
Where is the boy?

They all have one thing in common.
Please tell him to wait.

I counted up to 200.
He is studying at his desk.
I can't figure out whether you're stubborn or stupid.
Tom had only three dollars on him.
I did so for the sake of my health.
We believe it was possible that Tom poisoned Mary.
Tom hasn't been here long.
"If you want to stay here, you are welcome to."
What is it that you want?
Did you get a reply from Tom?
I had my driver's license renewed last month.
I prefer French films to American ones.
I don't have vodka.
You've been so understanding.
That's what I've always loved about you.
No one understands me like you do.
The Nile is the largest river in Africa.
Tom enjoyed himself a lot at the party.

His house was burnt down.
I have just washed the car.
Tom was a sensitive child and he cried easily.
I can teach you how to repair your car.
I'll go home and get it.
What is my room number?
Tom is going to die in the morning for a crime he didn't commit.
Do you want to go out or stay at home? Either is OK with me.
I can't remember the last time I had so much fun.
Why did you paint the bench red?
Tom doesn't think I'll do that.
She bought a hair brush and a tooth brush.
"To the best of my knowledge, he will not come."
Every problem can be solved.
You were very brave.
I don't understand what you want.
Tom wanted to be a doctor.
Did Tom say he needed to do that?
Can you ask Tom to come in?
"Happiness depends, not so much on circumstances, as on one's way of looking at one's life."

Tom volunteered to help.
Why do you want me to stop?
What is truth?
I'm ashamed that my son is such a lazybones.
Can you see anything out there?
Did you ask Tom why he wasn't at the meeting?
I would rather let him have his own way.
You aren't invited.
Grab an umbrella.
How late is the bank open?
Tom disobeyed a direct order from a superior officer.
She bought a vacuum cleaner at the supermarket.
I returned to Japan.
You haven't finished your coffee.
You've got until 2:30 tomorrow to get this done.

When does the exam start?
We're going to fight.
Tom is here to protect me.
How many people are you expecting?
The estimate was a complete shock!
Take the children into the house.
What kind of lawyer are you?
The purpose of a roundabout is to slow down traffic.
What are you waiting for?
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Are these the glasses you're looking for?
How much did you pay for it?
I hope that this letter finds you in perfect health.
I should have left earlier.
I want to meet Tom.
Please help me fill out this form.
Tom blew his top when he heard that Mary had gone out with John.
"It's not ideal, but it's the least unsatisfactory solution."
"Once you learn it, you never forget."
She looks like a teacher.
Somebody has to finish this job.
I'm counting on you not to back out.
Delete that picture.
This is a life-sized statue.
Tom wasn't willing to do what Mary asked him to do.
You may go.
They felt their candidate would win in 1860.
Wasn't it your suggestion to Tom that he sell that car?
Let's be honest with each other.
Most men here wear ties every day.
He looks bored.
School starts at nine.
"Like it or not, you have to do it."
I am leaving for Tokyo tomorrow.
I didn't know you were going to be here today.
Tom blinked again.
Which hat do you want to buy?
What's the best way to get there?
Let's go that way.
The nation needed more and better teachers.
I almost forgot it.
It's not too much.
I don't care what Tom does.
He likes Italian food.
This cage is made of wire.
They went whale watching.
I can't say that I'm surprised.

Where's Tom sleeping?
I wanted to say no.
What are you going to do for Tom?
I had a puppy when I was a boy.
How long do you plan to stay?
Tom isn't around.
Tom was the first one to leave work today.
He's not my type.
Come to my house at eight.
He would not admit his fault.
Cows are eating grass in the meadow.
Tom needs to answer the question.
I'm as curious as you are.
Men need to feel important.
I know this place is haunted.
What exactly does it mean?
She's got a point.
I like your attitude.
It was time for breakfast.
Do you want another one of these?
The population of this city is decreasing every year.
Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand my explanation.

Kane was an old friend of the president.
I just told Tom that I wanted to help him clean the garage.
I can teach you how to fight.
Please tell me you're not serious.
That's not why I did it.
You look very dignified.
I just did this to make a little money.
Tom said hello.
Monday is the only day of the week that I don't get home before 2:30.
I think Tom would probably disagree with you.
This book is available at one shop only.
I am short of money.
Tom said he thought that it wouldn't be possible to do that.
"Tom wasn't getting any help from anyone, so he gave up."
The lamp was swinging back and forth.
I think I'll buy this tie.
You must allow for his youth.
It was only a joke.

Have you taken your medicine?
I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
I suppose you have the right to know.
Do you know what you need to bring?
They lived a happy life.
I know that you've been waiting for this.
I am very happy in Georgia.
Tom packed his bags.
People often complain about the weather.
You're avoiding me.
Tom pushed against the door with all his weight.
Don't work too much!
Doesn't Tom ever do that?
I want Italian dressing on my salad.
That's a good response.
Tom put a lot of effort into his school project.
Tom doesn't live in Boston yet.

Tom is a world-class athlete.
My elbow still hurts.
I like pizza very much.
The report is utterly false.
How do you like your new school?
In summer and early autumn typhoons can strike the city. In recent years they haven't caused much damage.
A crystal chandelier was hanging over the table.
I don't think that anybody really understands me.
"While I was reading, I fell asleep."
You must keep your room clean.

Don't call me a jerk.
Try to concentrate.
I really look forward to your visit in the near future.
He was excommunicated.
We've got to be ready in thirty minutes.
Tom is intolerant.
Tom looked sleepy.
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
That's an excellent choice.
What color is your hair?
She runs.
Tom came by this morning.
Such a ridiculous superstition no longer exists.
I learned French instead of German.
His face was twisted with pain.
I'm just trying to do the right thing.
It is easy to answer the question.
I took part in the contest.
There is a bus stop near our school.
It was a bold decision.
Have you read the manual?
There is a house on the hill.
I should've known better.

Tom loves flowers.
I want you to use it.

I am sick of his long speech.
Tom heard someone humming his favorite tune.
Are you feeling better today?
I would rather die than steal from others.
"No matter who says so, it's not true."
Does she know your telephone number?
Tom was just trying to be friendly.
I have a different opinion.
Whoever wants the book may have it.
Tom might possibly know the answer.
I went back to my seat.
You're just wasting your time.
It's my turn to wash the dishes.
We have walked all around the lake.
Many weeds were growing among the flowers.
Some people are disappointed.
May I accompany you to the airport?
His proposal is not worth talking about.
I don't know what went wrong.
Tom reacted instantly.
Are you in Boston right now?
Does Tom make money?
What are you doing out here?
Is Mary Tom's mother?
Tom ate one apple and Mary ate the other.
A bird can glide through the air without moving its wings.
They say that you never forget your first love.
Pardon me for interrupting you.

Stop it. You're being ridiculous.
I was tired and cold.
How much is the tour per person?
The pilgrims brought gifts from distant lands.
"As a rule, I prefer people who deal with matters of this kind directly with those involved."
I'll handle that later.
I think you'll be impressed.
Tom is very hungry.
The store will be closed tomorrow.
Could you tell me the way to the port?
Tom didn't have to do that.
The president was a farmer when he was young.
You and I don't see eye-to-eye.
Tom needs you in the briefing room.
How do they look?
Don't worry. It's going to be fine.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
Cheese is easy to cut with a knife.
Tom didn't buy anything at that store because he thought the prices were too high.

I know you can make it.
Why doesn't Tom like me?
She fell down the ladder.
"If I had enough time, I would talk with you."
He entered the army.
"Are you sure about this, Tom?"
I never wanted to deceive you.
What's your favorite opera?
The elevator stopped on the second floor.
It's great to have a family.
It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
"Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa, watching TV."
Tom thought it would be a good idea to start a website that sold nothing but popcorn.
I am fed up with your nonsense.
My sister is shorter than you.
Mary is showing signs of severe depression.
I wonder who that girl is.
How is your job search going?
Have you paid the bill yet?
Please give me some more coffee.
I know that you're disappointed.
Tom isn't a very good carpenter.
I had no idea there'd be this many people here.
Tom is like one of the family.
Why don't you put on some clothes?
Sometimes it's hard to persuade children to eat.
Why would I wear that?
I'm feeling kind of dizzy.
Tom needs a friend.
I want an answer from you as soon a possible.
Your brother will not buy it.
It will clear up soon.
What did you bring?
How naive do you think I am?
I sent Tom back home.
Thanks for your support.
Hot lemon with honey is a good remedy for colds.
You know enough.
We fixed the date for our class reunion.
"If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some."
"Aren't you from Boston, too?"
He died yesterday.
He was laughed at by his friends.
"If anything happens, let me know."
Perhaps this is wrong.
I really have to think about this a bit more.
Look closely.
Tom died Monday morning.
He explained how the accident came about.
I think I'd better stay here.
"Music festival goers were met at the entrance by police sniffer dogs, resulting in over one hundred arrests for drug possession."
There are some things we need to discuss.
I can't go alone.
Let me be.
Tom has gone insane.
What are you implying?
I have nothing to tell you at this moment.
I took the cake out of the oven too early.
Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius.
All you have to do is to push this button.
He's lying.
Did you meet her?
I gave them clothing and some food.
His position enabled him to do so.
Tom found a job as a mechanic.
There will be a lunar eclipse tomorrow.
You haven't finished your coffee.
"Hey, how're you doing?"
Where are you going?
Tom and Mary are both in the classroom.
It's all I want.
It doesn't make much sense to me that I have to pay more income tax than you even though you make more money than I do.
We'll know soon.
Are you good at French?
Tom didn't have the courage to go there alone.
I want to get Tom something nice for his birthday.
The road parallels the river.
"It sounds impossible, but it's true."
She takes great pleasure in her work.
I want to know why I'm here.
You stink.
You should have prepared for the lesson.
Ignore it.
What else do you know about Tom?
You're always drinking alone.
Let me heat it up some leftovers for you.
I saw you crying.
She needed some money to buy something to feed her dog.
The yen is rising and the dollar is falling.
Does Tom still live on Park Street?
When did you buy that?
Thank you for waking me up.
I have less than fifteen.
I thought you were in prison.
"Fill it with regular, please."
I have no one to help me.
Tom handles a saw very well.
I can understand what she is saying.
They are both very excited.
Tom wants to relax.
Tom tossed the book on the couch.
You'd better not have drunk all the milk.
I love trying to do new things.
Tom ordered some food.
Tom thinks he knows where Mary lives.
Tom had several photos of Mary hanging on his wall.
I left right away.
"You love children, don't you?"
Why do you say such horrible things about me?
He took a day off.
What is the story?
Are you sure you don't want me to help you out?
I felt guilty.
I need to catch up on some sleep.
This doll belongs to me.
I was surprised to see you here.
I don't have any money.
They are still children.
Let me think about it a bit longer.
I want Tom to wash the car.
I have just a few questions.
No one lives here anymore.
Tom's unwillingness to help surprised Mary.
Do you know how to use a computer?

"First I'll look at the prices, and only then I'll decide whether I'll buy the camera or not."
This is a story written in easy English.
Tom likes to stay home and read books on weekends.
I bet you're hungry.
I made a rough calculation.
Tom is the perfect man for the job.
Are you a student of a private high school?
I don't think it'll work.
Dogs breathe approximately 30 times a minute.
There is nothing going on between Tom and me.
Tom is picking flowers.
They jumped through a window into the river.
Tom was buried next to his wife.
"Tom, the pizza's here."
We drink our tea with sugar.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
"Just looking at her, you can tell that she likes you."
He's completely crazy.
You should write a novel.
How many boys are in this class?
You had better go and speak to him in person.
We saw you.
Tom was one of three children.
Study English every day.
This packaging is hard to remove.
His promise cannot be relied on.
Tom is my husband's middle name.
Tom laughed like an idiot.
Thank you very much for your letter.
Most Americans are descended from immigrants.
Tom refused to tell me where he'd put my car keys.
My name should be on that list.
What is it you'd like to know?
You're doing it right.
The tea set isn't complete.
How do we do it?
Do you want another one of these?
I walk to school.
I'm not in love with you.
Tom has poor eyesight.
This watch is a real bargain.
"Whenever I hear that song, I remember my youth."
You can do it.
Open the safe.
Tell me why you did it.
I am tired of hearing that.
Wouldn't it be better if I went with you?
The meeting was canceled.
I never asked you to do that.
"I'd like to do it, but unfortunately I don't have the time."
I'd love to go.
Tom walked fast.
"This problem seems to be easy on the surface, but it's really difficult."
The noise was ceaseless.
How many laps did you swim?
I don't like the shape of this hat.
Tom remained cool.
There is a little water in the bottle.
Did you bring them?
Are you sure you want to do this right now?
Tom and I want to go home.
Tom ordered this.
Are you hurt?
You can't see my house from here.
The fire was soon extinguished.
He missed the last train.
She is far from honest.
It was an extremely cruel war.
Is Tom still aboard?
"Hey, don't forget this."
I think that games such as Candy Crush are a waste of time.
Don't let Tom go outside today.
Mary was so happy that she started dancing.
Do you know how many people in the world starve to death every year?
Tom is evil.
Tom has been getting up early.
The townspeople like to eat thick steaks.
Do we have enough chairs?
I swear I'll tell you everything someday.
We work to earn money.
Tom has to give Mary something.
She has been sick since last week.
You're just jealous.
Tom has 12 siblings.
I walked around aimlessly.
Does Tom really believe that?
She is working night and day.
Where do you get your hair done?
An elephant is a very large animal.
Will you let me try once more?
The ground was covered with leaves.
Have a good time.
She values health above wealth.
Something seems to be wrong with this watch.
This bird can't fly.
Hand me the letter.
"You remember that, don't you?"
Could you please tell me why?
Don't you want to go to Boston?
She told me everything.
Things are getting out of hand.
Are you in Boston?
Tom chose not to respond.
The boy had the kindness to show us around.
I found the book boring.
Tom arrived at just the right moment.
You must work.
She'll be having dinner with him at this time tomorrow.
She really wants to lose weight.
I don't know how to get home from here.
It is none the less true.
Tom was sitting alone at a private table eating the most expensive meal that the restaurant served.
What is the book about?
The flower shop is opposite the park.
I like onions.
Watermelons are in season now.
I've seen dolphins smarter than you.
He transferred his whole estate to his son.
It was nothing less than a miracle.
He could not speak clearly.
Where's my wife?
Tom says that recently he isn't able to get enough sleep.
We've been looking for you.
I'll do that for sure.
I must know the truth about him.
This table is made of wood.
There's a map on the wall.
I assume you can speak French.
Can you read what that says?
How long do I have to wait?
Tom had his wife Mary followed by a private detective.
Tom should have known better than to lend money to Mary.
Go inside.
You're such a coward.
I can't get the car to start.
The meeting lasted until 5.
Tom is responding well to the treatment.
Tom waited nervously.
You look very pale.
It's my CD.
The population of Shanghai is as large as that of Tokyo.
The road which leads to the hotel is narrow.
Tom caused quite a lot of trouble.
I'd like to lie down.
Will it rain this afternoon?

I work in a post office during the summer holidays.
He got lost while he was walking in the woods.
Tom had his chauffeur drive him to the theater.
"It's not what you say that counts, but how you say it."
I asked what was wrong.
It could happen to anyone.
I was wondering if you were going to show up today.
Tom is a high school history teacher and a part-time harmonica player in a blues band.
We're still not allowed to visit Tom.
I came as soon as I found out.
Do you eat seaweed in your country?
Do you know what Tom ate for lunch?
May I sit next to you?
He visited Japan when he was president.
What's your wish?
The train leaves at nine o'clock.
Your dog is here.
It was a very fortunate meeting.
"For the past month, we've had no snow at all."
I dislocated my shoulder.
He lives like a king.
How do I know you're not just making this up?
She appeared to have forgotten my name.
Tom is expected to make a full recovery.
Tom could tell that Mary was dying.
You won't be needing that where you're going.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
It was a most beautiful flower.
We're going to eat a lot tonight so I hope you're not on a diet.
He is not entirely without courage.
Why didn't you call?
Exceptions prove the rule.
What do you want to do with your life?
I have to earn a living.
Please speak as clearly as possible.
Even smart people sometimes do stupid things.
I like Tom's approach.
Tom has probably gone for a walk.
I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me.
Don't call me so late at night.
We were up all night.
I'm afraid we have no choice.
They can't say you didn't warn Tom.
Is it anything like mine?
I'm feeding the goldfish.
This room has air conditioning.
May I invite you to dinner?
Tom has an identical twin brother and few people can tell them apart.
Mary received a telegraph from Tom.
We found one.
My parents have been married since before I was born.
I'll have some cereal and orange juice.
Mary pretended she was sick to avoid going to school.
Tom never forgot.
His failure led to his resignation.
This is the village where he was born.
Tom and Mary want to see you.
Do ants have ears?
Show me another camera.
We'll start.
Were you listening to the radio yesterday?
She is everything to him.
Nobody was interested.
Does it bother you if I smoke?
Don't get involved with those people.
That house belongs to me.
I'll help you if you help me.
You overestimate him.
You will have guessed its meaning by the end of the chapter.
Why did you invite Tom to the party?
Do you prefer white rice or brown rice?
She can't stop me.
Try it on.
What are you going to do about Tom?
I work for a shipping company.
It took longer than I expected it to take.
Tom said he decided it was too hard to do.
"Trust me, he said."
Tom put some milk in his coffee.
I don't want Tom to know about this.
My father doesn't let me go out alone at night.
Could you please pass me the salt?
A large amount of money was spent on the new bridge.
What were you two arguing about?
That will be funny.
Tom and Mary got married very recently.
You'd better take an umbrella.
"Out of twenty students, only one has read the book."
Tom left the water on.
What's in front of you?
"You aren't going to wear that, are you?"
You may choose whichever book you like.
Tom usually doesn't make mistakes.
Tom walked alone.
It's not very durable.
Leave it right where it is.
It's ours.
I'm going to sit on the bench over there next to the street lamp.
Tom wasn't polite.
He declined their invitation.
That's complete nonsense.
You must go at once.
"Give me a hand, will you?"
Dinosaurs died out a very long time ago.
Tom was born on a ship.
He wrote a lot of stories.
This is Ali's book.
Do you think I'm joking?
Have some ham.
At least you'll have something to write home about.
It was difficult to remove the coffee stain.
This time you must go there.
My hobby is shopping.
Tom is resolute.
Come tomorrow.
Tom wanted me to find out where you've been.
"My birthday is a month from today. That is to say, April 5th."
She laid her baby on the bed.
Tom looks happier than usual.
I'm also taking this train.
Shut all the doors and windows.
Tom said he had to go somewhere.
Who are you trying to impress?
He accepted our offer.
Stop beating around the bush.
I think that you're wrong.
I cried all morning.
His voice broke when he was twelve.
You deserve better.
I'm about ready to go.
I don't know why Tom is here.
They have everything under control.
"She loves Tom, not me."
"Close the window, will you?"
You explained that well.
She was sure the man was telling a lie.
I slept all day yesterday.
Tom stabbed his wife to death.
Tom! What are you doing?
Don't you want to study?
It sounds like having time alone has been good for you.
I sent him a letter to let him know my decision.
Do you want to know what I think is going on?
I don't want to try anything else.
Texting while crossing the street is dangerous.
This is where I work.
There is not much hope.
Your dress is unsuitable for the occasion.
I know each one of you.
It's way past your bedtime.
"Since I had a cold, I didn't go to school."
Everybody showed sympathy toward the prisoner.
Tom doesn't teach French anymore.
I don't think she can speak French.
It's time for you to go to bed.
The investigation concluded that the police officer had done nothing wrong.
I am coughing.
We have no reason for staying here.
I'm very pleased to be here.
Be careful not to say something stupid.
Don't eat my food while I'm gone.
I know none of the three men.
Why are you doing that?
"If you do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
"When I got back, I found my car missing."
Would you say you're a morning person?
"May I see your driver's license, sir?"
I'd like to ask one or two questions myself.
I would've sent Tom money.
"Come in, the door's open."
I don't know him.
Everybody but Tom smiled.
We're both very tired.
Have I forgotten anything?
What was the first instrument you learned to play?
Some of the birds didn't fly.
I let my friend copy my homework.
Tom seems to be very sick.
Tom said he didn't really care what happened.
Tom speaks three languages.
Our hot-air balloon rose into the sky.
What does that say?
Why do people dye their hair?
What are you talking about?
Tom was shivering.
I've got one like that already.
Tom did an excellent job.
You need to take your shoes off before entering the room.
I don't have a brother.
I need a bucket.
"After Tom passed away, Mary went back to her parents' home."
I live next door to the toy shop.
I can't make any promises.
That cost him his job.
I'm a thirty-year-old unmarried woman.
I'll be back after lunch.
What does it feel like to be a patient?
Something is going on.
That's my book.
Don't make Tom do that.

You need to get here as soon as you can.
Would you mind telling me who you're waiting for?
That's really sad.
I saw your light was on and knew you were still awake.
Don't fall for his old tricks.
Tom and Mary are having a little financial trouble.
Let's measure how tall you are.
This is gold.
"If Tom said three hundred dollars, he meant three hundred dollars."
We wondered what we could do.
Even Tom cried.
You'll end up in jail.
This fact must not be forgotten.
Don't say things like that.
The problem is solved.
Tom studies here.
Do you often go to see plays?
Ten years is a long time to wait.
We have finished the work for today.
Tom has a British accent.
We can't let them kill Tom.
The factory always made good quality shoes.

I got a lot out of that book I read.
I am beginning to understand.
What's wrong with you tonight?
Who was this machine invented by?
I'm in a good mood.
I heard what you said to Tom at school.
Are you going to be long?
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
They began to walk again after a while.
You'll never guess what Tom did.
"This house is very big, isn't it?"
I'm not a hero.
Take Tom downtown.
"Whose glasses are these? ""They are my father's."""
This flower smells nice.
I'm playing with my cat.
Are you awake?
Have I disappointed you?
She refused to accept his proposal.
She likes Hiroshima better than any other city.
Tom has started dating Mary.

It's really dark here. I can't see anything.
Do you like Renaissance art?
"I like Tom, but he doesn't like me."
His wealth has not made him happy.
Who wears the pants in your family?
What does Tom think he's doing?
I envy Tom.
It's almost impossible to imagine.
She treated each of us to an ice cream.
I can't make that decision without consulting Tom first.
She locked the door.
Never tell a lie!

Tom was really happy.
Can I talk to you?

I've got to do this.
Tom died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
I'll be free this evening.
This is a waste of time.
We love this school.
I feel more dead than alive.
Do you think you could give me a paper bag?
Tom got home just before 2:30.
"At last, we were home!"
I grew up in the mountains.
How about tonight?
The number of stars in the sky is infinite.
The context is important.
"If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home."
I think I know what's happening now.
I don't remember what time Tom told me to meet him tomorrow.
"We have everything we need: money, time, and brains."
Tom may do that.
Tom was sentenced to five months in prison.
My father has just come home.
I have a sprained ankle.
I would've said no.
"I couldn't go to the concert, because my mother was sick."
I can't read small letters.
This sentence may be interpreted another way.
I expect to be back by the 20th.
"If I'd wanted your help, I'd have asked for it."
Was that you on TV last night?
Tom thought that there was a good chance that it was Mary who had stolen the painting.
I don't need any more help.
You're perfectly right.

It is no good arguing with you.
It was everything I hoped for.
This time you won't be alone.

Would you like to have a cup of tea?
I'd feel better if Tom knew about this.
I reluctantly agreed.
I did everything for you.
Tom heard that.
I know you considered me a close friend.
Your instincts were right about Tom.
Do you know whose car this is?

I'll call the cops.
I'm trying to get in touch with her sister.
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Prices continued to rise.

How are we going to get in?

He gritted his teeth and forced back his growing fear.
Don't make me come in there.

That's what I'm really worried about.
They kept singing until a rescue team came.
Tom put the presents under the Christmas tree.
I'll get even with you for this insult!
You should give up smoking.
Do you like writing?
Tom wants to speak.
I know very little about him.
Tom likes feeding the pigeons in the park.
Did you answer Tom's question?
Did you actually see the accident?
A day without you is like a summer without the sun.
They didn't even know where to go.
You don't have to be here.

When are you going to talk to Tom about that?
I will go on foot.

The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way to Ueno.
Where did you get this money?
I erased my name off the list.
"Cold water, please."
"My bicycle had a flat tire, so I missed the seven o'clock train."
He won a bronze medal.
Let's hope he's all right.
I don't know where Tom used to live.
The station's near the hotel.
He was careful not to disrupt the meeting.
I didn't know any of the songs.
I don't think it's true.
Do you know where your children are?
It's raining today. Where is my umbrella?

Are we going to eat out tonight?
Will you show me how to set up a cot?

I sat next to him.
He looked much better this morning than yesterday.
I have a surprise for you guys.

Tom and Mary are friends with John.
Tom told me he didn't have much money.
Don't blame the victim.
Tom tossed the ball to Mary.
Tom wasn't the last person who lived in this house.
I know about Tom and Mary.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
Tom waited.
We love picnics.
"Someone had definitely spiked Tom's drink, because he could no longer stand up and the next morning he could remember nothing."
When do you intend to do that?
Are you good at playing the piano?
Thanks anyway.
"With a hundred dollars, I could manage."
Do you see that house? That's my house.
Tom sat down next to me.

I'm sick of this hand-to-mouth existence.
I'm glad you like my apartment.
You're the only one who asks those kinds of questions.
Tom has known Mary a long time.
I've had a scratchy throat since this morning. I wonder if I've caught a cold.
We broke up on Valentine's Day.
It's like summer outside.
You could let us go.
We gained access to the house through the window.
And what do I have to do now?
Tom understands what Mary wants him to do.
I'm here to listen.

You can't go home now.
There's something I have to know.
"Since my room faces south, it isn't so cold even in the winter."
How did you manage to get Tom to do that?
Tom returned from the kitchen with two mugs of coffee and sat down next to Mary.
You must be tired after such a long trip.

I knew Tom was different.
No one else knows it.
Mary pretended she was sick to avoid going to school.
Tom's mailbox is full of postcards.
You're not my type.
You're not safe here.
Even Tom was baffled.
Thanks for coming with me.

"Whatever you do, don't open that door."
I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
You sure sleep a lot.
He woke up naked and confused.
Dogs bark.
Tom didn't even know I was here.
I can no longer stand this noise.
This is the best thing on earth.
I don't know when Tom will come.
Everyone knows of his affection for that dog.
Tom hit the snooze button.
I cannot stop her.
I miss my mom and dad.
He isn't like his brother.
You look smashing.
"We'll miss you, Tom."

He's a little pale.
She went to Germany to study medicine.
I can't remember everything Tom told me.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
Nature endowed her with both a sound mind and a sound body.
Tom may not be there.
Tom is our guide.
How do they know?
He entered Tokyo University this spring.
I don't think anybody can help me anymore.
The small boys rang the door bell and ran away.
I know what's going on.
Why did Tom do this?
The boy made his parents happy.
It's not on the menu.
Why do yields increase with herbicide-resistant varieties?
The plural of ox is oxen.
There is a crack in the glass.
Please don't leave valuable things here.
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
I'm not going to say it twice.
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before.
These books will make your work easier.
Where are Tom and his family living now?
I prefer to study in the morning.
The door of the meeting room is open.
Tom is waiting in the hallway.
I was expecting you last night.
I have a better idea. Let's order a pizza and stay here.
"Even though we disagree on many things, there are some things we agree on."
Let's climb to the top of this mountain.
Tom is still in a bad mood.
He was spotted stealing cookies.
Tom is full of life.
Your success depends on whether you pass the STEP examination or not.
"Frankly speaking, he's wrong."
He's totally dependent on his parents.
"I can't remember how to say ""Thank you"" in German."
This table isn't steady.
I do a lot of work on the school newspaper.
Tom neither confirmed nor denied the rumors.
"Due to bad weather, the plane was late."
Tom took Friday off.
It's very stuffy in here.
"I want a cellular phone, but I don't have enough money to pay for one."
Do you like cooking?
Maybe what you said about Tom is right.
There was a lot of tension between Tom and Mary.
Hang on!
I don't like either of the two clocks.
Get on the horse.
What was Tom's last name?
Some said openly that they did not care who won the war.
Thank you for setting the record straight.
Let's speak in English.
I'll come back. I promise.
Guess what I want to do now.
Is Tom married?
Don't talk with your mouth full.
"I would like to buy this watch, but unfortunately it's just too expensive."
Do not let go of the rope till I tell you.
You've asked me that three times already.
She can skate.
Do you really want to fight?
Little did she dream that she could win first prize.
Don't leave your work half finished.
Why don't you tell me?
Tom is pruning the trees.
Tom did it all.
I'm not the only one who was absent.
Tom didn't know why Mary wouldn't do what he asked her to do.
We had lunch at a little coffee shop.
It is abnormal to eat so much.
Doctors recommend eating three meals a day.
I barely got out of there alive.
You are not Japanese.
Just give it a try.
I hate this music.
I borrowed the book from this library.
He pushed his way through the crowd.
I guess you don't recognize me.
Think what you want.
Atlantic City is famous for its boardwalk.
That may easily have been a mistake.
India gained independence from Britain in 1947.
Tom glanced down.
What do you say we go to my house?
It's terrifying.
Mary is the most beautiful girl I know.
"To my surprise, he had a beautiful voice."
What do Japanese students usually eat for lunch?
Why did you bring it?
Don't go out of your way.
Tom passed away three years ago.
Do you have a minute?
Tom can't stop Mary from saying what she thinks.
I met Tom the other day.
Everything is expensive in London.
The old man lives on his pension.
You should write it down before you forget it.
I hear you've got a new girlfriend.
I love them.
I can't do it anymore.
No one ever really knows what goes on behind closed doors.
Aren't you going to go?
Today I want to eat something light.
"I don't know how to say ""I'm sorry"" in French."
May I interrupt?
I'm very concerned.
I don't worry about Tom.
Can you help me when I move?
Thanks for ironing my clothes for me.
I have nothing to declare.
He is the tallest person in the class.
He has been driving for hours.
Why did you say such a thing to him?
My whole family's from Boston.
They got the short end of the stick.
He doesn't live here anymore.
I don't like your name.
He does not know.
I pretended to work.
Tom lost his colleagues' trust.
One hand washes the other.
Maybe I should study German.
I told you Tom would give me something for my birthday.
I will buy a car.
Who's at the switchboard today?
It's really difficult to describe.
I think we're the only people on this island.
Does anybody here have a corkscrew?
"What is it, Tom?"
I concentrated on what he was saying.
"May I have a glass of wine, please?"
"One can't help many, but many can help one."
She looks very sick.
The king oppressed his people.
Tom seemed mad.
Tom taught Mary how to cook.
"You were pretending, weren't you?"
Tom makes a good living.
Tom made cookies.
Why did you decide to not go to Boston with Tom?
I can hide anywhere.
The problem is that we don't have a lot of money.
My mother often suffers from headaches.
He has a crush on this girl.
He finished it as quick as lightning.
Let us help Tom.
You should eat more fruit.
I feel a strong attraction to the music of Beethoven.
There seem to be few people who can solve that math problem.
Tom never admits he's wrong even when he knows he is.
"If you leave your textbooks at school during the break, they'll get confiscated."
Tom is going to Boston with me.
Where did you go yesterday?
Tom held the coin between his thumb and forefinger.
"Four years from now, you'll have no competition."
Your dress is already out of fashion.
I've never seen you laugh.
I'm tired of eating fast food.
I'm taking off.
I bought a camera not long ago.
It'll all be over soon.
Where's my food?
Tom's lips were blue.
What wasn't easy?
I have work to do.
Tom can't possibly be serious.
Tom saw Mary today.
I ran home.
All the men are hardworking.
"Is it the first time you've been here? ""Yes, it's my first visit."""
Do you know who this belongs to?
Quiet down.
Get out of my room.
Tom isn't on Facebook.
"I remember it as if it were yesterday, but in reality it was fifteen years ago."
"As you can see, I haven't done any cleaning in the house for some time."
My passport is no longer valid.
She is anxious about your health.
Should we change the flag?
I came to this country for the purpose of studying music.
Tom seems happier than before.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
She invited him in.
I'm glad to hear of your success.
How big is your house?
He gets tired easily.
Tom was found dead in his bed.
What do you enjoy doing?
Do you really think that's fair?
The wreckage of the plane was found in the desert.
He felt awkward after she kissed him.
"I'd like to help you, but I'm a bit busy right now."
I've heard that some people sleep in bathtubs.
He was a warm gentleman with a pleasant sense of humor.
Tom helped me do my homework.
That's an order.
Watch your toes.
"Tom donated $30,000 to charity last year."
He is the last man I want to see.
We have better stuff to do.
Tom found something hidden behind the dresser.
Tom wants to change out of his wet clothes into something dry.
"His debts amount to $2,000."
Why didn't you tell me that?
I stared at the ceiling.
Please give me a cup of tea.
That's what you're good at.
Armstrong was the first man to reach the moon.
Thank you for being here.
Tom didn't do what he's being punished for.
You need to lose some weight.
You must be careful not to waste time.
Who'll cook?
"If that's what you want to do, do it."
It is no use blaming him for the accident now.
The letter will arrive in a week or so.
"She said to herself, ""Where shall I go next?"""
Translating is not nearly as easy as many people might think.
How many cars do you have?
How many floors does this building have?
"Much as I'd like to come, I'm afraid I'll be too busy."
Tom and Mary need to get up early tomorrow morning.
I want to know how you did it.
I allowed Tom to kiss me.
I'm the only one who can do that.
Do you know what you've done?
Children should not be spoiled.
You're wasteful.
He isn't able to buy a car.
Watch out for cars when you cross the street.
Eat more vegetables.
I wonder what this place was like three years ago.
I assume there's somebody somewhere who likes Tom.
Tom didn't say who he'd gone with.
I'm allergic to dogs.
It was easy for him to solve the problem.
I can't tell Tom the truth.
The dog waited day after day for its master's return.
Obesity is considered by far the most serious health issue facing the developed world.
There'll be coffee and cake at five.
The enemy dropped many bombs on the factory.
I haven't seen him for years.
Tom's home is filled with antiques.
Do I have to do anything?
Do you enjoy walking on the beach?
What's your room number?
Throw it to me.
The tree had been blown down by the typhoon of the day before.
How long have you been in this town?
Do you like bowling?
Wow! What a big box!
He had three pieces of baggage.
Tom is going to study French next year.
The chair is not near the window.
The bird was looking for worms.
"Even though Tom's in his forties, he still lives at home with his parents."
We can't do it.
You don't have to do that today.
There have been no problems so far.
I can't believe it's already time to go home.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I should have paid a little more attention.
Why would I tell you?
I don't know what I'm going to do yet.
Please write a letter to me.
Last summer I traveled to Italy.
We can't be sure of what happened to Tom.
Do you know him at all?
Can I drive the tractor?
Tom said that's no problem.
She decided to go.
I prefer working to doing nothing.
He is about forty.
I will write to you as soon as I can.
I was young at the time.
I have a dentist appointment at 2:30.
You may go at once.
CO₂ has a lot to do with the so-called greenhouse effect.
Who else is there with you?
Are you satisfied with the political situation in your country?
I never want to see you again.
Kyoto depends on the tourist industry.
Tom speaks no French.
Open your eyes.
You are so kind.
He had many political enemies.
Tom has nothing else to do.
The thief ran fast.
I am leaving at four.
"Since I didn't eat anything for breakfast, I'm very hungry now."
I think it's time for me to do my homework.
Mary was like a sister to me.
I don't want to be seen in his company.
We'll do it when we have time.
I will never have a son.
Where are my glasses?
Evening was drawing near.
Make your airplane reservations early since flights fill up quickly around Christmas.
He was suddenly very happy.
There's been a lot of rain this summer.
Tom says he did not mean to kill her.
I'm in the same boat as you.
Who wouldn't love to find one of these under the tree on Christmas morning?
Tom was at home alone.
Lie still.
Tom thinks that's not a good idea.
You knew I knew.
Tom has trouble remembering names.
I'm glad you asked me for advice.
The area is built up now.
Would you like to drink anything?
What do you think he said when I asked him for a favor?
Tom had cancer.
Nobody can help me.
We can not agree with you on this point.
"I slept all day yesterday, because it was Sunday."
I'm already tired.
Do you write short stories?
Tom slept in the barn.
Tom is a patient and thoughtful man.
"Says who? ""Says me."""
Do you want something to drink?
I felt that he skirted around the most important issues.
Would you explain what this is?
I saw nothing at all.
Don't depend on your parents too much.
It's totally different.
I have a cold.
It's just a piece of paper.
Tom enjoys reading French literature.
I suggest you have a talk with Tom.
He put some sugar and milk in his tea.
Tom started it.
Don't be noisy in this room.
Tom phoned.
I just remembered that I have something I have to do.
What a beautiful view!
This is the woman I told you about.
We're losing control of the situation.
I hope that your brother is better.
We want Tom to help Mary.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
She picked up a coin.
I told you Tom would help us out.

I do not like music.
How did you learn to speak French so well?
Tom and Mary skated on the frozen pond.
It's fun to speak in French.
I want to eat pizza tonight.
She is thirty-one.
Tom arrived first.
I don't see why.
Is it a recent picture?
I ordered five books on economics from London.
Are you going to vote in the upcoming election?
We waited.
I'm doing well.
I bet Tom can speak French.
Tom seems stressed.
I don't like the name Tom.
Where's the nearest museum?

There are many long words in the German language.
"You've given this some thought, haven't you?"

Tom burped.
It's still a little early to eat lunch.
May I bring my family along?
It is not his business.
Tom said that he thought Mary understood.
I heard that Tom got married to a rich woman.
Tom became weak.
I believe that he's trustworthy.
I no longer want that.
Do you trust my judgment?
The doctor told Tom to stay in bed and get as much rest as he could.
Tom couldn't find his glasses.
I heard that you helped Tom find a job.
"Can she come, too?"
Tom wasn't scared.
Tom did it out of the goodness of his heart.
Perhaps it's just a coincidence.
Something needs to be done.
Tom isn't as patient as you.

They have demanded that all copies of the book be destroyed.
Do you like cooking?
Tom will meet Mary somewhere in Boston.
Tom told the doctor that he felt no pain.

What kind of person are you?
I want to fly above the clouds.
Is this too big?
I feel like going out today.
Is this the first time for you to have Japanese food?
Does Tom know where Mary was born?
Tom poured himself some milk.
I'd like to ask Tom what his thoughts are.
Let's start.
"This is the last train, sir."
Modern cats don't eat mice.
We do have other choices.
Tom is a hillbilly.
I want to talk frankly with him.
More and more women have their own careers and are economically independent of their husbands.
Break it down.
The city was blanketed with snow.
I wrote her a letter every day.
I'll go.
My hobby is collecting coins.
We amused ourselves playing cards.
Wait a second.
Please write down everything I say.
Give them money.
Please take off your hat.

Follow your sister's example.
Pandas are cute.
I haven't seen Tom this angry in a long time.
I hope you don't mind.

We'll get there.
What would you like to drink today?
I wish that Tom would just shut up.
Have you ever taught French to anyone?
He ignored her advice.
Stop scaring Tom.
Tell us a little about your family.
I don't like your suggestion.
This problem deserves considering.
Have a good look at this picture.
"Which is longer, this pen or that one?"
I like the new South African flag.

You can't just stand there and watch Tom die.
It makes me nervous.
Tom suggested that we go to the zoo.
You can't seat Tom next to Mary.
I'm going to need help.

Is she nice?
Am I older than you?
I want a room for tonight.
Tom wanted to know how Mary had become so rich.
The party was held on May 22nd.

Is dinner ready?
Where is the washroom?
What does Tom have?
I don't like doing this.
Why are you being so generous?
"Walking along the street, I met an old friend of mine."
Keep going straight.
I accept your apology.
"We are breakfasting at seven, if you would like to join us."

We're just one big happy family.
I want to watch you dance.
You should have come to us.

Did you really say that?
Come and see me.

I'm not going to name names.

You're scaring me.

Someone's standing in front of the gate.
Tom's parents thought that Mary was too old for him.
I sneeze all the time.
They are talking about this and that.
I'm tired.
I've got to speak to Tom.
We must prevent this type of incident from recurring.
Tom broke down.
I asked him to do that.
How much rent do you pay?
I don't get along with my stepfather.
The guitar is in tune.
Stop yelling!
"Can we get this over with, please?"
I polished my shoes.
Tom is out of work now.
"She used to keep a diary, but she no longer does."
Tom doesn't read many books.
The word is no longer in use.
It isn't worthwhile going there.
I entered a singing contest.
He added to his savings.
I don't have enough RAM.
The two women know each other.
Thanks for the chocolate. It was delicious.
Tom fainted as soon as he saw the needle.
I am dyeing my hair brown.
Some fish fly.
"Tom is just a friend, not my boyfriend."
It was a great trip.
You can't miss the bank. It's on the right.
We want you to be the team captain.
The lights went out.
The cake was very delicious.
Does it hurt when you chew?
Turn on the radio.
Tom said goodbye to Mary.
Try it out yourself.
Tom is taller than I am.
I should've gone home.
What time did you go to sleep yesterday?
I'm pretty sure the first thing you'll want to do when you get to Boston is call home.
The leaves have begun to change color.
Tom will obey you.
"Excuse me, but could you get me a glass of water?"
I'm a pretty good swimmer.
This alone is enough to convince us.
You should've stayed in Boston.
What do you want to happen?
Let's pick flowers from the garden.
I can be there in ten minutes.
The two boys began to blame each other.
Both are alive.
"The date on the calendar was September 23, 1964."
I'll look forward to it.
You don't have to hurry.
Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?
You shouldn't prejudge people.
You can have it for nothing.
Tom carried the chairs to the next room.
Please go on with your story.
Does Tom know why you're here?
This is really delicious.
We have had more rain this year than last year.
I'd like to look like Tom.
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
I run every day.
I'd like to see what's going on.
The moon is shining.
There is a television in the room.
That's the absolute truth.
He has a brother who lives in Tokyo.
What do you want to give Tom?
Nobody speaks well of that politician.
He's a member of the golf club.
Did you get my messages?
Tom said that he wasn't hungry.
She translated it word for word.
Would you mind watching my things while I go for a swim?
It wasn't easy.
"In my opinion, she is correct."
I hope you don't change your mind.
I've let everybody down.
It looks like Tom only wears expensive clothes.
I think I've broken my arm.
My father thinks that he's always right.
I can't stand the cold.
My parents are from China.
This is extremely important.
He's gone senile.
Tom walked in the door at just the right time.
This gift is for you.
Could somebody please open the door?
I should've listened to my father.
The difference between the two versions isn't clear.
She stared at me.
Among the guests invited to the party were two foreign ladies.
Tom and Mary got married about three years ago.
"On the days he doesn't take a nap, he's bad tempered."
We would be very pleased if you paid us a visit.
I wanted to hurt Tom.
Words cannot describe it.
My figures don't seem to tally with yours.
He is strong as a horse.
The room was illuminated with red lights.
Tom doesn't have flood insurance.
Read it aloud.
The statue has no head.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
The television doesn't work.
This document is for your eyes only.
Do you have a website?
I watched the baseball game last night.
How did you become involved in this project?
That isn't Tom's car.
Tom isn't getting one.
I'm sick of fish.
They should ask Tom first.
"If I were to go abroad, I would go to France."
Does this look pink to you?
Please be gentle.
Do men cry?
I help Tom almost every day.
Tom's imaginative.
Tom asked Mary for advice.
I slept for three hours this afternoon.
Who else was in here?
Tom thinks this is a mistake.
Will you have some more tea?
Can you please pass me the newspaper?
Tom trusted you.
Tom and Mary started talking as soon as they both entered the room.
Mary is hanging up the washing.
A fierce dog attacked the girl.
We couldn't open the door because it was locked from the inside.
I need a place I can study.
It's still true today.
That's really sweet.
Tom and Mary are so happy you're here.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
I assemble car engines.
I saw a figure approaching in the distance.
You've put on weight.
"When it rains, it pours."
What vegetables do you usually grow?
Don't take our word for it.
The book I bought last week was really interesting.
I'll be in my study.
Our new teacher is fresh out of college.
I am the tallest in our class.
How many spoonfuls of sugar do you usually put in your tea?
I'm glad you're staying.
I've always wanted to travel through Europe.
Tom and Mary don't have much money so they seldom eat out.
"If you're tired, why don't you go to sleep? ""Because if I go to sleep now I will wake up too early."""
Does that surprise you?
The devil always finds a way to make something bad even worse.
Please don't go away.
Tom'll wait.
"Can I have another beer, please?"
What kind of man are you?
Tom didn't need to take a taxi. He could have walked.
Tom sneezed again.
Tom has been stabbed several times.
She has her arm in a cast.
There may be hope for you yet.
How many eggs could you get yesterday?
Tom sat alone in the dark.
This does not apply to students.
I like neither of the pictures.
"I'm feeling fine, thanks."
You should not go there.
Tom has no manners at all.
You are making history.
Her mother has been sick since last Thursday.
"As soon as it gets dark, the fireworks will start."
Tom is too young to drink beer.
I would do anything just to hold you in my arms.
We've isolated the problem.
The village is beyond those trees.
Do it while you still can.
I don't feel like talking.
Do not underestimate my power.
Don't put the saddle on the wrong horse.
A spell of fine weather enabled us to get the harvest in safely.
Tom looks lonely.
It is no use pretending you know nothing about it.
Bad weather prevented us from departing.
Tom is missing a few teeth.
He is making cookies.
We're all happy.
I recommend you to go by train.
Tom introduced me to his roommate.
That was not an earthquake.
Have you ever translated a book?
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
She must have been over thirty when she got married.
All hope is gone.
Tom saw it.
That's a picture of Tom and his cat.
All you care about is money.
You had better learn either English or French.
Tom can take the bus to the station. You don't need to drive him.
There's no one here who can deal with the problem.
Your watch gains time.
We want justice.
Don't make me shoot you again.
"You're in love with Tom, aren't you?"
We can't ignore Tom's past.
Tom could help you.
I owe you a big apology.
"That sounds credible, doesn't it?"
I've always dreamed of living abroad.
Tom and I are usually the ones who do that.
Tom's decision to get married surprised his family.
"She owes him a lot of money, but she probably won't be able to pay it back."
Who cares what happens to Tom?
He witnessed the murder.
Maybe Tom is too busy to help us.
Tom doesn't want anyone in his room while he's away.
You were never alone.
Let's take a taxi.
This fruit tastes bad.
I'd like something to drink.
I'm responsible for what my son has done.
She combed her hair and bound it with a ribbon.
"I thought I would be nervous, but I was cool as a cucumber."
Tom isn't sure yet whether he'll go or not.
Do you go to school on foot every day?
Consider yourselves my prisoners.
This is not important.
I don't want your money.
What are you smirking about?
I was just trying to impress Tom.
About how much would it cost to have this chair repaired?
That applies to him too.
We named the cat Mimi.
I didn't even know that.
Let's take the short cut.
Don't mention the matter to him.
I certainly don't blame you.
Do you talk about us?
Is she interested in me?
He has been to Europe many times.
Hasn't Tom started doing that yet?
Mother often said that she was proud of me.
Tom said that he wasn't sorry.
He's not going to make it.
January is the first month of the calendar.
He read the letter over and over.
I'm not going to work with you today.
I gave the dog two pieces of meat.
How can you avoid the dangers of the Internet?
Tom was nervous before the race.
We discussed the plan yesterday.
Don't drink too much champagne.
Tom doubts what happened today will ever happen again.
Let's talk about it after school.
There's no reason to worry.
He has been to many places.
Tom made up his mind to be a firefighter.
I love surprise parties.
Why do you say things like that?
"Yesterday, I bought a red car."
You can't be serious.
An accident prohibited his attending the ceremony.
"Working together, they cleaned the entire house in no time."
I was about to suggest the same thing.
Tom didn't need to look at the menu because he'd been to that restaurant many times before.
Tom might not be hungry yet.
This sweater costs more than fifty dollars.
The lawyer believed in his client's innocence.
Lincoln was elected President of the United States in 1860.
Tom didn't become famous until late in his life.
A pinched sciatic nerve can be excruciatingly painful.
It's just that simple.
Your idea is similar to mine.
Are you on Facebook?
"After digressing, he returned to the subject."
Don't make fun of Tom.
What a fool I was!
Your cake is delicious.
Can you manage to complete the manuscript by Friday?
It's not Monday.
I've been in business thirty years.
You're the best dad ever.
They move from place to place.
I was one of the best students in the class.
The cats are meowing.
What did you drink?
The reasons for our failure are as follows.
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with him.
This must be changed.
Tom likes to swim.
Tom repeated his question.
His car is really cool.
She got on a bus and took a seat in the front.
Do you think Tom knows what happened?
Everyone's saying it.
Yesterday I had my bicycle stolen.
"Go straight, then turn right."
Has Tom ever written a letter in French?
You may ask any questions you want.
Why didn't you call us?
"It's raining, so please bring your umbrella."
That's a fir tree.
Tom shrugged.
Tom hardly ever laughs.
The river overflowed.
I thought Tom wasn't at home.
Tom is foolhardy.
It's very unlikely that Tom wrote this report.
"You don't happen to know where Tom is, do you?"
Tom saw Mary dancing with John.
This is a good place to camp.
I'd like to learn how to play the banjo.
I'll ask you once more.
My brother says he isn't afraid of the dark.
I'm afraid I'm not familiar with that expression.
My father always comes up with something witty to say.
Tom never mentioned it to me.
The car is not available today.
It's part of life.
Everyone in her class likes her.
I've heard some good things about you.
"Tom wants to kill you, Mary."
She earns 30 dollars per day.
How long have you been in this town?
So long.
Tom and Mary hugged and kissed each other.
Do you know how to use this machine?

I want you to stop singing.
What happens if I press this button?
Tom is training his dog.
Tom talked Mary into helping him.
Do you think this is crazy?
The airport is in Osaka Bay.
That's Tom's father.
I don't want your pity.
I was counting on you.
I'm not good at French.
Let's not be in too much of a hurry.
The importance of this matter cannot be over-emphasized.
Tom can't drive.
I did what I was trained to do.
What do I need to do now?
What was the final score of the game?
That's a good price.
Thank you for your advice.
Thanks for seeing me.
He threw a stone at the dog.
My sister is engaged to him.
I remember everything you tell me.
"I don't have a lot of work, but it's enough to keep me in the office this week."
Tom is very particular about what he eats.
The dead outnumber the living.
Would you like to do something this weekend?
Tom is looking at Mary.
I wore a coat so I wouldn't catch a cold.
Don't forget to turn off the gas before leaving the house.
Give someone else a chance.
He returned home after being away for ten months.
I had completely forgotten.
Many people only speak one language.
She will be back at five.
I knew you'd like that.
Tell Tom to get back here as soon as he can.
It is interesting that no one noticed that mistake.
The content of the letter had an interesting effect on my marriage.
The man was a total stranger.
The trains are running on schedule.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Sounds good to me.
Feed the bird!
Do you want Tom to wait?
I have known him ever since he was a child.
Tom didn't want to disappoint Mary.
Don't hurt my son.
What else did you do there?
"In the United States, a tablespoon is equivalent to three teaspoons."
Are you really willing to pay that much?
That's really bad.
We expect Tom to come back soon.
The apples he sent to me were delicious.
Tom knows what's up.
I like reading mystery novels.
The pond is frozen.
Tom won't stop you.
Tom cracked a joke.
Tom walked towards the door.
I'm not one of them.
A button came off my coat.
I'd like to open an account.
You leave me no choice.
Tom asked me to give you this.
You should start as early as possible.

It's well past Tom's bedtime.
Tom says he doesn't want to do that with you.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
Is it true that you bought a house in London?
Call me again in two days.
Many people have been vaccinated against the flu this year as well.
I want to come back here.
"After I found out where Tom went, I went to look for him."
Tom surprised me.
There are no problems.
Where is Boston?
I'd love to stay.
"It's his, isn't it?"
Tom doesn't need to do anything.
I'd appreciate it if you could come.

Who else do you know that can speak French?
The lamb was killed by the wolf.
They were left to fend for themselves.
Today is a holiday.
Tom bought a new camera for Mary to replace the one he had borrowed and lost.
They can't believe it.
That's a problem we have to deal with all the time.
His explanation doesn't make sense at all.
Tom was released for good behavior.
I like stories.
She did it for her children.
Tom wants to learn how to play drums.
She understands him.
"Tom, I need your help."
When will you be free?
He writes to his parents once a month.
He sat there surrounded by his children.
Tom couldn't have done it without you.
Somebody has to be here for Tom.
We agree on this point.
That's a great plan.
Is Tom mad at us?
I thought he would come alone.
Have you read this book already?
Let's ask if it's true.
Is your car black?
Please get out of here immediately.

What are you planning to do after this is over?
Take a breath and hold it.
Don't leave town.
"I met her at the station, but I did not recognize her in uniform."
They all say that.
He kept all the windows open.
Leave my family alone.
Hard work is the price of success.
They laughed.
How about a cup of coffee?
Tom doesn't know what he'd do without Mary.
"I don't want to get married, but I want to have kids."
The moon is exceptionally pretty tonight.
You lead the way.
We have to make sure Tom doesn't do that.
Will you sign it for me?

How did you know I was Canadian?
Everything happens for a reason.
You look very pretty today.

I really hope that doesn't happen.
I want you to call it off.
I still have friends in Boston.
Could you please wait until I'm finished?
She put on a coat.

I need to lose a few pounds.
No one loves me.
You're so cute together.
I haven't talked to Tom since then.
We stayed at a nice hotel.

Almost everyone in this room is taller than me.
Can you open the door for me?
I should've stayed.
"I had more questions, but Tom seemed to be tired of my questions, so I didn't ask them."
He stuck to his job.
We're heading for the beach. Would you like to come with us?
I couldn't think of the name of the place.

I don't want to get involved in that business.
Shouldn't you be at home with your mother?
Canada is larger than Japan.
Tom seems to be lying.
Get on your knees.
Where am I going to go?
Tom punched me in the face.
It's still breathing.
My toe started bleeding.
None of us was able to answer the question.
He cannot stop me.
There are many kinds of coffee.
"Tom knows about this, doesn't he?"
Do you have any pictures of Tom?
It is never too late to learn.
Will it hurt a lot?
The poor people were at the mercy of the cruel dictator.
Could you please overlook it this time?
This isn't about me.
I want my lawyer.
Isn't it a bit small?
It's not uncommon for students to not study until the night before a test.
My apartment is in that building.
I hope you're doing well.
I'd do it again.
Who are you laughing at?
Tom raised the three children by himself.
Tom is hilarious.
I armed myself with a knife.
The library is on the second floor.
You'll love it.
Tom has cerebral palsy.
I'm not quite sure.
Tom didn't want to take over the family business.
Tom is on life support.
I've been saying that all along.
The snow has begun melting.
"I wish you were wrong, but I know that you're right."
Tom continued to speak.
It's the third biggest city of Serbia.
I'm sure about this.
He gave me a bad cold.
It's time for us to start thinking about how we can improve the situation.
We got up after midnight.
What should I do if Tom calls?
"During his teens and twenties, Tom was a party animal, but he now lives a sedate life with his wife Mary, and children."
Put on this sweater.
It is going to rain soon.
"In addition to his regular job, he has a lot of other activities."
Tom invited Mary and her sister to his party.
There isn't anybody else.
The red dress looked good on her.
We went shopping yesterday.
Why doesn't he dance with me anymore?
You should have attended today's meeting.
I did everything I could to help Tom find a job.
I'm one of your students.
Where is the stop for the airport buses?
Keep it quiet.
I am squeezing an orange.
I'm Irish but I don't speak Irish.
"You are a busy man, so I will adjust my schedule to yours."
I knew you'd be hungry.
I'm not convinced that Tom is telling the truth.
Two people say they heard a gunshot.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
Go to bed.
I like to take a hot bath every night before bed.
Try putting yourself in your mother's shoes.
Tom has a good reputation.
You may as well go home now.
He loves trains.

That sounds like fun.
It is possible for you to read this book in a few days.
The matter is of great importance to me.
I can prove it to you.

Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System.
What are you writing?
Tom refused to give up.
I don't want to live by your rules.
What do you think of my theory?
He is suffering from a cold.
You didn't finish filling out this form.
They lost everything.
Tom and I are both a little busy right now.
I've spent most of my life in Boston.
Follow Tom.
Lansing is the state capital of Michigan.
I was aching for a cigarette.
Sometimes I still miss her.
Are you afraid of me?
They attributed the low death rate of infants to the progress of medicine.
They kissed each other.
Tom says he wants to settle down.
Tom's crying.
"It's good, isn't it?"
Do you want to do it?
She began piano lessons when she was six years old.
Thank you very much for the undeserved attention.
Tom said that he was going to help.
I didn't know you were related to Tom.
The doctor told us that what Tom has isn't contagious.
Get your hands off me.
He has overcome many obstacles.
Tom had an appointment.
These wild flowers give off a nice smell.
I didn't say you took it.

I like jazz music.
There was no one on the other end of the line.
What's the weather like in New York?
Get off this ship right now.
Are they your friends?
I often study while listening to music.
Tom picked out a gift for Mary.
The children are playing marbles.
Don't ever give up hope.
Barack Obama is the President of the United States.
I have wine.
She likes nobody and nobody likes her.
The lid is closed.
He is standing on the stage.
Tom and Mary nodded to each other.
I was worried sick about Tom.
The huge explosion killed six people.
Tom must have been at home at that time.
I'm an orphan.
Did you enjoy that?
It looks like we're being ignored.
Tom lacks persistence.
Tom has been married three times.
Tom had a hunch that Mary was lying.
Where does he work?
I think Tom kind of likes Mary.
Tom never helps me.
Tom is correct.
She likes miniskirts.
Don't trust anybody.
"When Tom was a kid, the only book in the house was a Bible."
I teach Tom's children French three days a week.
I have two brothers.
The young man saved the girl from drowning.
I want to be with Tom.
It seemed like too much trouble.
I'd rather not speak French.
I saw Tom play tennis.
I couldn't go to work because I was sick.
My grandma has gotten very old.
I wonder if there's any connection.
Tom got on the wrong train.
She helped him tie his tie.
Tom promised me he'd buy me something to eat on the way home.
She must have taken the wrong bus.
Why are you looking at me like that?
They were right.
This has never been tried before.
Tom used a toothpick.
I am taking French next year.
This cloth is superior to that.
We want our money back.
I don't think they like me.
He stopped smoking last year.
Have you finished reading the book?
Do you think Tom is handsome?
Do what you like.
Are you saying you don't want to go?
The youngest daughter was particularly beautiful.
I knew it was just a misunderstanding.
The runner jumped over the hole in the ground.
I thought you were planning to be here earlier.
It is said that he is sick.
"A good book is the best of friends, the same today and forever."
Tom is our best pilot.
This is very surprising.
You did it all right.
Eggs can be used as weapons.
I must go now.
You look nice in that red sweater.
He hid his emotions and pretended to be enthusiastic.
Everyone thinks the same thing.
I've got a magazine article I want to show you.
"During the summer, I will go to France."
They'll like that.
Did we wake you up?
Please help Tom.
She screamed for help.
I'll see you again.
Tom is a man who can be trusted.
Tom usually eats alone.
Am I so different from you?
The pyramids of Egypt are one of the seven wonders of the world.
Is it OK if I drink all of this?
We don't have time for this.
Tom stayed over.

Tom won't deal.
This textbook is good.
Tom will talk.
I have great news for you.
"Would you leave us alone, please?"
I'm against the war.
Tom might never speak to me again.
We only take cash.
I have nothing to wear.
Don't you feel cold?
What's that bird?
Tom looks busy.
I suppose it's going to rain this evening.
What does Tom want to eat?
He asked me to.
I hope to see you again before long.
Tom needs urgent help.
I don't like to go out when it's dark.
Tom will have to wait.
Tom tried to get Mary to help John.
Tom is getting scared.
The results were negative.
The shooting started around noon.
I noticed that I had grown up when I started following my parents' advice.
"If you worry too much, you'll go bald."
Patience is sometimes the most effective weapon.
I'm not going to play this game.
This is the core of the problem.
I wasn't able to come because of the rain.
I need authorization.
I'm no busier than usual.
How did you see that?
I have my orders.
I'm still your boss.
Is there anything else you'd like?
Do you like my new shirt?
Where is Tom buried?
Are you sure you're warm enough?
This teacher was well liked by his students.
He will explain it to you when he comes back.
Is that what Tom would want?
Tom is very honest.
They're average students.
What am I doing here?
I rented a car yesterday.
Tom doesn't have any friends who like to go camping.
Are you going to do your homework this afternoon?
This book is very small.
That's my favorite band.
Have you tried restarting your router?
Tom smiled at Mary and she smiled back.
Put it on.
People who break the law are punished.
Tom drives a Rolls Royce.
Can you tell me what happened?
Tom sealed the envelope.
Tom began to sweat.
Did it not occur to you to close the windows?
Perhaps I can help you.
I will grant that you are right on this point.
We were both very hungry.
Our guests will arrive in a few minutes.
Tom is three inches taller than his wife is.
Please translate this into French.
Tom is a confident young man.
They hid in the cellar.
Tom is distraught.
Tom never arrives on time.
Tom is out of work at this time.
"Finally, on January eighth, the British attacked."
The hat on the desk is Tom's.
"I'm just looking, thank you."
He put the book on the table.
It doesn't take Tom long to take a shower.
I haven't found Tom yet.
Hold Tom for me.
Tom dropped out of school when he was thirteen.
What I really want is for Tom to teach me how to play a few chords on my guitar.
It's urgent.
You're the only one who knows how to do this.
He kept me from making a big mistake.
I wonder how Tom found out.
Your friend is here.
The door was locked from the inside.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
"If it were true, what would you do?"
I've never met anyone who doesn't like chocolate.
Tom knew you would try to convince him not to go.
Could you tell me what's going on?
Don't get caught.
Did you get a massage?
Tie the horse to that tree.
Tom didn't know how that could happen.
The supermarket didn't have what I wanted.
I think you need to think about the future.
Can you taste the ginger?
"Pardon me, do you speak English?"
Could you elaborate?
Tom can't do it all on his own.
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
Do you find me repulsive?
We have enough time to catch the train.
Sulfur burns with a blue flame.
Let's cut to the chase.
Tom made dinner.
We are forty kilometers away from the capital city.
Some kids are playing in the park.
She screamed with terror.
Stop wasting time and get back to work.
Your birthday is the same as mine.
"We can do without a television, can't we?"
"If I were to tell you the whole truth, you would be amazed."
He has a hat on.
I don't like spicy food.
They'll know.
You should probably tell Tom you don't want to do that.
She was eating a sandwich.
What did she whisper to you?
Where're the shoes?
Who's your teacher?
Their meeting was inevitable.
You had better look up the word.
"Wake up, Tom."
That was your choice.
What do you have your feet for?
Tom is a fascist.
Disconnect the plug.
This machine is out of order.
I would like another cup of tea before I go.
What should we expect?
You might have left it in the car.
I spoke French to Tom.
Tom looked about.
I want to leave this place quickly.
I don't have to ask anyone.
Her silence surprised me.
You have cancer.
"Was there a dead body in the room? ""No, there was no body there."""
I need to know before 2:30.
I saw Tom doing it.
My hairline is receding.
Was it interesting?
I don't like studying.
I have an explanation.
I sympathize.
Tom heard Mary yelling.
Tom has been asking to see you.
What's your favorite lipstick brand?
The first few years were difficult.
I know how to do it.
I took my little sister by the hand when we crossed the street.
It's noisy next door.
I came early so I could get a good seat.
Be careful crossing the street.
I love being right.
I'm starting to lose my patience with you.
She lacks common sense.
The police are after me.
Tom is older than he looks.
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
Something seems to be missing.
Tom is eloquent.
The school gate is closed.
Everything depends upon your decision.
Anywhere with a bed will do.
Horses are animals.
He kept on writing stories about animals.
I can't remember the last time I had a martini.
I can't go to work in these clothes.
I believe I can help with that.
Tom isn't good at doing that.
"If you have pain, take a painkiller."
Tom reminds me of a boy I used to know.
Are you the boss?
Wait a moment.
Tom and Mary were too tired to fight.
Tom thinks Mary is very cute.
She told him to stop.
The next concert will take place in June.
Tell me who you are and where you come from.
What have you done with the books?
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
He is very mean to me.
There is no clock in my room.
Did you turn off the stove?
Tom gave Mary one of his guitars.
Tom wished Mary liked him better.
She is well known in both India and China.
More than 40 percent of the students go to university.
Tom tends to be late.
I know a lot about it.
I'd like to work with Tom.
They don't want it.
I was very surprised at the news.
Tom's company imports tea from India.
Marriage can be a wonderful thing if two people understand each other.
Can you take me home now?
Go away.
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
Tom fooled all of us.
Tom is cute.
I'm not overly interested in the event.
I can swim as well as you.
I don't like to wear shoes without socks.
Tom died in combat.
He was absorbed in thought.
"This way, gentlemen!"
They helped each other.
Tom knew it.
You still have a lot to learn about women.
I thought you'd changed.
We have six lessons a day.
I was confused at first.
One cannot survive without money.
Tom is in Boston.
I am taking tomorrow off.
Tom has been on TV every night for thirty years.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted something to drink.
I think I'm in love with you.
You broke the rule.
Is there any chance of your coming to Tokyo again this year?
"You know how serious things are, don't you?"
Is this information right?
Tom said that's what he wants to do.
"You're fluent in French, right?"
She spread honey thickly on her toast.
Please don't quote me.
He was too young to live alone.
Mary asked me if I loved her.
"Innovations will be grossly overestimated at first, but grossly underestimated in the long run."
He's playing Tetris.
Do these paintings appeal to you?
Tom sang his son to sleep.
Tom makes way too many snide remarks. That's perhaps why he doesn't have very many friends.
What kind of fool do you think I am?
When do you need it?
Don't tell Tom where you live.
I don't remember what happened.
A stranger came into the building.
"The baby cannot even walk, much less run."
Tell me what you need.
The cat is hiding under the couch.
I thought Tom was a complete idiot.
Tom noticed that John and Mary were holding hands.
I met him the day before.
It was broad daylight when I woke up.
The plane took off and was soon out of sight.
Tom doesn't think there is any advantage of doing it the way you suggest we do it.
Tom had to explain the joke to Mary.
I had a fantastic time at your party.
We can't just ignore what Tom told us to do.
I promise you won't regret it.
Tom said that he decided it was too difficult to do.
I have a dentist appointment.
What makes you think Tom had anything to do with it?
I can't let Tom do that.
There is a small pond in our garden.
I read your letter yesterday.
It would be best if I met him in person.
Tom spoke.
I don't know everybody in this school.
I'm going to spend the weekend in Boston.
I don't feel sorry for her.
I want Tom to be happy.
Can you eat raw oysters?
Isn't that where we first met?
Humans are the only animals that wear clothes.
I understand you met with Tom recently.
I have a return ticket to Osaka.
I thought a lot about what Tom said.
Is this your idea of a good time?
You didn't miss a thing.
Tom is a trucker.
Tom has a map.
He stopped smoking on his doctor's advice.
I'm afraid you're wrong.
"Tom is honest and expects other people to be honest, too."
Why do you distrust me?
The pie that Tom made was delicious.
This fact shows that he is honest.
I've been waiting for her for an hour.
I like to buy clothes.
She made him a new coat.
Tom wiped his hands on the dirty towel.
It's well worth it.
I can't give up smoking.
Tom explained the situation to me.
I thought you two should meet each other.
Thanks for your input.
I can't play piano.
Be happy for me.
Please enter a valid email address.
Are you drinking green tea?
She graduated from high school last year.
Mosquitoes are attracted to smell of human feet and Limburger cheese.
I want to take Tom home.
"By the time you get out of prison, she'll be married."
I made a mistake.
That amounts to the same thing.
I just don't get it.
We need to learn to work together.
Tom rolled over in bed.
Tom will be a university student this year.
How much is the annual membership fee?
Tom promised not to tell Mary anything.
He is trying hard to give up smoking.
Tom was confined to a bed for three months.
Tom will finish serving his sentence next month.
I spent the whole weekend at home on the computer.
Have you ever been there?
I only met him once.
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
It's not always like that.
Tom was starting to lose hope.
Tom is a rabbi.
"She's well-informed, so she might know something."
The old man asked me the time.
Tom screamed.
You know as well as I do that we have no chance of surviving.
I hope that Tom can wait for us.
He denied the accusation.
"I owe him 50,000 yen."
We offered him a good job.
Tom plants sunflowers every spring.
She used to go to the museum on Sundays.
They aren't farmers.
Tom came on his own.
"Tom is a good friend of yours, isn't he?"
Why is there no food in my refrigerator?
Which cat is yours?
Please turn around and look at me.
Tom grumbled.
There may be hope for you yet.
Tom is sitting under that tree over there.
Everyone screamed.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
She urged him to drive carefully.
He died ten years ago.
Am I annoying you?
His opinion was unimportant.
We can't afford to make mistakes.
The line is busy.
My left arm is asleep.
The police were able to find the criminal.
"We can't leave our tents on the beach where they are now. If we do, they'll be under water during high tide."
"As a result of the war, many people died."
"In fact, you are quite right."
Do you have some dental floss?
Any comments are welcome.
Just try it.
Tom said jokingly that he was not very rich.
I feel like an outsider.
My girlfriend is Chinese.
I ought to have enough money saved up to buy a car by Christmas.
They waited outside.
Murder is punishable by death.
Few people visit me these days.
He got out of the habit of smoking.
Tomorrow is her birthday.
Tom prevented Mary from doing that.
I have every reason to believe that he is innocent of the crime.
Where is your patriotism?
He has gone out.
What's this key for?
Please tell me. I really want to hear it.
I know who it was.
We're housesitting.
A shovel full of snow can weigh as much as 20 pounds.
Making a good start is half the battle.
I want to learn Japanese.
I hate being laughed at.
He's the oldest son.
We'll meet again someday.
He has a family to support.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
My whole body was one big bruise after the rugby game.
There was a silence.
I have something else I need you to do.
I do not know any of them.
Tom demonstrated how to core an apple.
I'm sure you're not half as glad as I am.
Tom gave Mary a Christmas present.
Tom took off his coat and gloves.
"If I were in your place, I would lend him a hand."
I'm right behind you.
What's the horse's name?
Should I fill it in now?
Tom walked Mary to the door and she left.
Tom predicted it.
I gave up.
His speech impressed us very much.
We have to be there Monday.
Someone asked for you.
It took only one day for us to do that.
Tom is using the blow torch.
"If I had known your telephone number, I would have called you."
They figured it out on their own.
Stop looking down.
Read it once more.
When was the potato introduced in Japan?
Give me three pieces of chalk.
Sapporo is the fifth largest city in Japan.
They'll understand us.
We'll need a head hunting agency to find the right man for this executive position.
He regrets having been lazy.
I'll let Tom know you called.
There's ample room in the attic.
I don't remember who gave me this.
Get ready for school.
Tom's prediction was correct.
Doesn't Tom want to go with us?
Are you planning on buying a car?
I'm afraid for his life.
Tom told me not to open the envelope until my birthday.
Let Tom answer.
I have to go home.
I no longer need them.
Don't harm them.
Where do you come from?
This room doesn't get a lot of sun.
"In the U.S., it is illegal to torture people in order to get information from them."
My taste is quite different from yours.
They attend every meeting.
"So, how did he like it?"
Tom got injured.
Tom is a self-made man.
That's nonsense. Nobody but a fool would believe it.
There's a call for you. It's Tom.
She is kind.
Do you think our climate has an influence on our character?
That disease is incurable.
You'll have to go.
You're going to turn a lot of heads with that dress.
"If it were not for your help, I could not run this store."
I don't know about that.
Tom was advised by Mary not to go there by himself.
I want you to go to the doctor.
I heard you were rich.
Tom looked awake.
Would you like me to help you do that?
He is watching my every move.
Handicapped parking is available.
There is nothing to prevent my going.
We're so happy for you.
Is there anyone who can speak Chinese here?
Tom promised us he'd help Mary.
"I've heard you play the viola and you're not very good, are you?"
Sea turtles have a long lifespan.
Tom wasn't wet.
Most people won't tell you what they really think.
No one warned me.
He entered the room after you left.
I never got caught.
How old were your kids when you moved to Boston?
Tom is a mechanic.
Tom is cleaning the pool.
"If anyone can do it, Tom can."
I'm not being paid for this.
Tom knows nothing about Boston.
Tom and Mary went trick-or-treating with their friends.
You have to do it today.
"According to the X-ray, everything is all right."
We're not welcome.
We'll catch Tom.
He's a strange person.
"If you permit me to speak, I can explain everything."
I saw Tom working on the report this morning.
Please give me one.
A trip by boat takes longer than by car.
That's exactly what he wanted.
I suddenly thought of my dead mother.
I don't quite know yet.
Tom isn't stopping.
Lincoln died in 1865.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
The bus driver suffered minor injuries.
I cannot find time to read the book.
We'll begin work soon.
Tom is a heavy drinker.
If only I had known the answer yesterday!
We will fight.
Can you climb the tree?
We always take a bus.
He was very poor.
I think we need more time.
"Do you want to hug me or kiss me? ""I want to do both."""
Won't you take a chair?
She kissed him.
I can't do it without you.
Tom turned on the car radio.
He tries hard.
He likes French more than German.
Doesn't Tom look good?
She won an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.
Tom seldom wears a hat.
His home run excited the crowd.
I have a gift for you.
I think Tom is OK.
Tom heard a fog horn in the distance.
How could you do that?
Tom ordered a cup of coffee.
Sewage often pollutes the ocean.
I'm capable of making my own decisions.
You're wicked.
We've waited a long time for this day.
Skiing is my favorite sport.
I don't like school.
The waitress put a white tablecloth on the table.
Tom has a pretty girlfriend.
Do you think this is interesting?
Tom won a prize in the spelling competition.
I think that someone spiked Mary's drink.
Tom let the cat out of the bag when he accidentally told his mother about the surprise party being planned for her.
You seem stressed.
Tom relaxed.
Tom answered.
Tom worked.
Why won't anybody help me?
Aren't you going to vote today?
You have six unread messages.
English has become an international language.
Just don't wait too long.
Are they in Paris?
Tom showed Mary an old newspaper article.
I've never cheated on a test.
I want you to leave me alone.
I have to wash the dishes.
Never have I seen such a beautiful rainbow.
I bought the black bike instead of the red one.
I just need a second.
This palace was built for the rich king.
Tom probably thought I was allergic to peanuts.
What do you like about me?
"It is quality, not quantity that counts."
You have betrayed us.
Tom ran over someone's dog.
I stayed there until he had left.
The picture reminded me of Scotland.
Don't you think I know that?
I would've said no.
I have something important to discuss with Tom.
The boys made fun of the girls.
I want to get drunk.
Tom and Mary seem to be enjoying themselves.
My mother is certain to say no.
Tom went out for a walk as he always does in the afternoon.
It's about time.
She extended her stay by five days.
We have to fix this.
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom is impossible to satisfy.
I already feel much better.
Are you taking the train?
Don't give up halfway.
Everybody calls him Tom.
Tom isn't as tired as Mary.
I already did that.
I waited for my husband till after midnight.
What does Tom do every day?
I quite agree.
Tom bought a microscope for Mary.
They can't protect us forever.
I paid for the purchase in cash.
Tom hardly ever loses at chess.
There are seven days in a week.
I was worried about you all day.
You must not leave right now.
It seems that you don't want me to succeed.
I'm meeting the professor at 1:30 p.m.
There is something wrong with my car.
Manuela's dresses are very elegant.
How did you learn that Tom wasn't living in Boston?
He does a kind act once a day.
They were in that room with me all night.
The children went to play in the park.
I'm going to take Tom to Mary's house.
I can't find my watch.
Tom said he's fine.
He promised me he would be here at six.
Is something bothering you?
Say hello to your father for me.
That's what I've always loved about you.
Get on the horse.
Tom keeps a pair of binoculars in the glove compartment of his car.
I don't want to be rich.
How old is your grandfather?
Have a safe journey home.
I feel like everyone is talking about me behind my back.
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I wanted to do.
I can't believe we haven't run into each other before.
Tom is like my brother.
I want you to help us find out who killed Tom.
I look forward to meeting Tom.
Tom didn't tell us everything.
Some people like it.
The speech lasted thirty minutes.
Why don't we take some time to think about it?
Are you sure that you want to go there?
I will miss you.
Tom is writing a new book.
You seem to be relieved.
The vase he broke is my aunt's.
I want you to send this parcel at once.
Be objective.
It is me that painted this picture.
I'd like to ask you about Tom.
Tom walked Mary to the subway station.
"Close your eyes, please."
I think it's dangerous to walk alone at night.
Do you think there's a chance I could get that job?
I want to ask you a favor.
What has Tom ever done for me?
I can't tell yet.
Do you have blankets?
I have to leave now.
What's wrong with these people?
Why do you have so many cats?
I'm telling you this confidentially.
Just put it back on the desk.
Are drinks free?
Tom left for school at the break of dawn.
I didn't get the point of his speech.
A penny for your thoughts.
Mary and Alice are Tom's nieces.
It won't make any difference.
Don't try to stop me.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
I ran into an old friend.
Don't accept drinks from strangers.
I saw the boat sink.
Tom is terrible at speaking French.
I'm glad to see you're happy.
It's the same thing.
Tom certainly knows where Mary is.
You won't need an umbrella today.
Tom switched off all the lights and lit the candles.
Don't worry about it.
My father manages the store.
Tom asked Mary to help him organize the party.
Tom lives really far from here.
Would you like to spend some time together this evening?
"I need your help, Tom."
I recommend not doing that the way Tom suggested.
What keeps you up at night?
Tom is going to be here.
Tom was eaten by a crocodile.
Tom drank a glass of orange juice.
I love you for who you are.
Tom said that he was planning to eat the whole watermelon by himself.
Come on over to have a try.
I'll have to give it some thought.
Which platform is the train for Boston?
The newly married couple walked hand in hand.
I don't live here.
She's a better leader than he is.
I care about all of you.
It is too hot.
He was surrounded by a throng of reporters.
Let's talk outside.
That's an interesting suggestion.
I can't let them catch you.
Tom needed some fresh supplies.
Lie down on your left side.
Forty people attended.
We associate Egypt with the Nile.
There is something fishy here.
Tom drew his gun and shot one of the men.
I feel sick whenever I see blood.
I will see you home.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom went back home.
The old man lives alone.
I saw a plane.
We can start over again.
I couldn't think up such a brief explanation.
What color are your eyes?
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
The doctor gave me a shot.
What does it look like?
We haven't met yet.
Tom recorded it.
You must really be proud of yourself.
Tom is a smooth talker.
I never wanted to harm you.
Thanks for your input.
What's the name of that piece?
Where are the children?
It's going to be all right.
The burglar gained access to the house through an unlocked side window.
How do you like New York?
The police are searching for Tom.
Tom always hugs his son when he returns from work.
We advanced to the finals.
They went fishing.
That's how it is done.
You may invite anyone you like.
"Needless to say, he was late for school as usual."
Tom is intense.
I don't know if it is good.
Tom says he has something to show us.
Tom often watches TV while eating dinner.
No one can guess how many jellybeans are in this jar.
I regarded the man as an enemy.
Could you check to see if the garage door is closed?
I sat on a park bench and waited for Tom.
"Tom took another shot at the crow, but missed again."
I really want to know what's happening here.
I saw a white bird on my way home.
They're all going to prison.
Tom speaks French with an accent.
I can't read your mind.
Tom is Mary's friend.
Where will you be on October 20th?
He is a very good speaker of English.
You know the drill.
Why are we stopping?
The question is whether he'll read the letter or not.
I would like you to come with me.
I could read between the lines.
Tom waved to everyone he saw.
My older brother manages that company.
This first question is for you.
I only wish I had a little more time to finish this.
You should be more reasonable.
The kitchen sink was full of dirty dishes.
Tom extinguished the fire.
Have you fixed the thermostat?
She is out on an errand.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
I stay home alone while my parents are at work.
I'll spare you the details.
Are you and Tom friends?
The defendant has no prior convictions.
Things are not like they used to be.
You aren't rich.
Did you know him well?
Tom has to be the last one to do that.
Your lives will be spared.
Tom doesn't think that's a good idea.
Tom didn't take a bath last night.
I'm too busy to have time to enjoy myself.
There is a desk in this room.
I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.
I was about to go to bed when he called me up.
You can't let Tom behave that way.
How long would it take me to get there by bus?
Tom and Mary both enjoy playing basketball.
I like skating better.
Tom was starving to death.
The judge sentenced Tom to three years in prison.
I told you the concert was going to be boring. Why didn't you believe me?
Is it always cold like this?
"Something's wrong, but I don't know what."
"As far as I'm concerned, I have no objection to the plan."
We had a layover in Chicago.
Is this a bad time to visit?
I thought you'd want to know.
No man escapes death.
"If a brain can do it, a computer can do it."
"You have friends who can help you, don't you?"
Aren't you curious?
Tom saw Mary and John arguing.
I wish we could do this every day.
It's getting colder.
Let me put it in another way.
It's been a long time since I've seen you smile.
I go to work with my neighbor.
Tom endured the pain.
"The bomb blew Tom's house to smithereens. Fortunately, he wasn't at home at the time."
They sang in tune.
What do you expect me to do?
What did you say?
Give me half of it.
Everyone is listening to the chairperson.
Tom isn't alone.
It is smaller than Tokyo.
The price of oil went down.
My feet hurt.
"Tom came to the conclusion that no matter what he did, Mary wouldn't like it."
We still have plenty of time.
What choice did I have?
The women whose daughter you spoke to doesn't live here.
I don't want to start anything I can't finish.
I wonder why Tom was murdered.
"Recently, a lot of people are losing their jobs."
She is everything to him.
We'll get it.
I just did what the boss asked me to do.
Are we alone in the universe?
You'd better go.
It's only temporary.
I think it'll rain today.
Those are your orders.
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?
I'd like to hear what you have to say on this.
Why are you doing the dishes? Let Tom do them.
Why don't you understand?
Which CD do you want to listen to?
I've been an athlete my whole life.
Tom asked Mary if she'd help him.
Can we afford all this?
He has a nice personality.
I'd like to know what happened.
"I'll study French, too."
Nothing comes from nothing.
What did Tom take?
"Mary's not pretty, but she isn't ugly, either."
Tom and Mary attempted to murder John.
I'm in the same boat.
Introduce me to your friend over there.
He had his socks on inside out.
You'll meet Tom.
The price includes tax.
"He got up quickly, splashed cold water on his face, brushed his teeth, and shaved."
Do you want to study French?
Tom called me and said that he needed me to do him a favor.
Take this medicine every four hours.
Please get dressed.
You're killing me.

A policeman is outside.
He felt that this was too good a chance to miss.
Things didn't go as planned.
I have to take a break.
"When he heard the news, he turned pale."
This is the cutest puppy I've ever seen.
She's not a good person.
When are you coming back to the office?
Tom has quite a lot of money.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
My home is on the eighth floor.
I have no idea how Tom must feel.
City life has advantages and disadvantages.
It's a good deal.
May I take a photo?
I named the kitten Tama.
Gold is far heavier than water.
We try our best.
I am in no mood for joking.
Tom didn't want to eat and Mary couldn't persuade him to.
Tom is playing by himself in the front yard.
Tom is angry and afraid.
He is having coffee now.
I know everybody here.
She bought the old table for next to nothing.
My wife works part time.
Everybody likes his jokes.
Tom played his part very well.
He definitely wanted to start a fight.
I never thought I'd see you again.
He stuck a flower in his buttonhole.
Do you want to drink?
He went to Italy ten years ago and has lived there ever since.
That's really sweet.
Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that today.
Tom isn't a student.
She brought a cup of tea to me.
She is awkward.
He is by far the best boy in the class.
I want my money.
Tom isn't creepy.
Tom will explain later.
I feel fantastic.
We're still too far away.
Tom'll quit.
They continued eating as if nothing had happened.
Do you hear that?
I bought a new fishing rod.
You can rest.
I felt cold and uneasy all night.
No one knows how many people died in that battle.
Tom confessed everything.
No one told me.
Tom broke that.
Let's take a break for coffee.
You should wait inside.
Tom gave a speech at a conference.
I made an abstract of a book.
I may give up soon and just take a nap.
I ate breakfast at eight.
Have you ever seen a whale?
We'd like separate checks.
Tom and Mary go hiking together every summer.
Tomorrow we go to school to sign up for the classes we want to take.
I remember seeing her once.
Tom stayed here.
Isn't that just an urban legend?
Could you turn it down?
Could you arrange to be here at five?
I think it's impossible for Tom.
Step forward.
This is a terrible thing.
Who teaches you French?
It was a solid gold bar.
Texas is almost twice the size of Germany.
You're strong.
"Whichever you choose, you cannot lose."
I wish I had done more.
The magazines were sold out.
"You've got time right now, don't you?"
Tom is no longer living in Boston.
Some things are perhaps not worth translating.
Go be with Tom.
He tried with all his might to stretch the bow and shoot the arrow as far as possible.
What'll you tell Tom?
Tom certainly should be careful not to make Mary angry when she's holding a knife.
You're telling me.
The Himalayas are higher than the Alps.
How about waiting here until he gets back?
Tom couldn't have done this alone.
Who taught you to write?
Who intervened?
Can you play the organ?
Where are your credit cards?
She was burning with anger.
Do your best!
Do I need to change my diet?
"Once I start cleaning, I can't stop myself."
This is a book.
Tom doesn't even talk to Mary anymore.
Korean food is generally very hot.
I'll tell you how to do it.
The earth goes around the sun.
This hat cost ten dollars.
Tom agreed to pick me up at 2:30.
Tom isn't where he wants to be.
Watch out! He's coming right at you!
You should eat more fruit.
Do you have work experience?
"Did you get angry, too?"
Tom has a deep voice.
I went skiing in Canada last winter.
"I don't have a cat, but Tom does."
I want to stay home and read a book.
I'm not sure if I'll go to Boston.
I don't own any expensive jewelry.
Have you ever failed an exam?
These flowers are from our garden.
You're old.
Why didn't you phone before coming?
Tom told me that he could see no reason why he shouldn't accept Mary's offer.
Tom turned around suddenly.
We go to school by bus.
Tom watched the tadpoles swimming in the jar that he'd put them in.
Please wrap it up.
The house by the lake is mine.
We must pay attention to the fact that no nation claimed sovereignty over this region.
Tom gave Mary the benefit of the doubt.
How do I get to the beach?
Get it done as soon as possible.
"I understand what you mean, but I'm not sure how to translate it."
My father often washes the dishes.
She doesn't want him to buy an expensive engagement ring.
"Can I get you a beer? ""Do you have anything stronger?"""
The accident happened two hours ago.
Thank you for your kind words.
I have a jealous husband.
Tom parties too much.
The soldiers were ordered to make an attack.
It's getting darker outside now.
The sisters are both blondes.
I like what I see.
I have no idea where he lives.
"If you buy me an ice cream, I'll kiss you."
"Speaking of Switzerland, have you ever been there in the winter?"
I'll be back soon.
When did your family arrive in Boston?
When was it that you first met her?
Can you recommend a good dictionary?
Did you hear about Tom and Mary?
Have you found any good solution?
Don't hold it upside down.
There were a lot of people in the room.
There were two left.
Tom looked pale.
He is thirty years old.
You have to raise your hand if you want to speak at the meeting.
Tom's friendly manner deceived us.
Tom asked me where I had bought my bicycle.
I prefer reading books to watching television.
He was kind enough to take us over to the island in his boat.
I hope you enjoyed your stay with us.
All the boys were looking at Tom.
You were the one who told me Tom couldn't be trusted.
I'd like a chance to explain why I made this choice.
Both my parents are at home now.
He has bad eyes.
Tom seemed kind of upset about it.
We won't be able to escape.
"October 20, 2014 was a Monday."
What a good shot!
Who has it?
How can we learn the truth?
I got my leg hurt in the accident.
I didn't care if anybody saw me.
I was astonished to hear that he failed.
Isn't that overkill?
I'd like you to drop the charges.
We never expected it.
Where is the next gas station?
What're you doing for the break?
We haven't seen you in the past four years.
Mother goes to the hospital in the morning.
Tom is very sorry.
What're they going to do to Tom and Mary?
I can't really remember.
Tom asked me how often I went to Australia.
Tom saved your life.
I've been waiting for you a long time.
"When I hear that song, I remember my younger days."
I repeated what he said exactly as he had said it.
Tom is a patient of mine.
I have a dog and two cats.
I got tired of waiting for Tom.
It's just the tip of the iceberg.
Tom is very close to Mary.
They gave up.
Don't you recognize me?
Tom is no longer here.
"You don't want to go to Boston, do you?"
We're very grateful for your hospitality.
He will never make it.
Do you shower every day?
I can't be bought.
Do you remember my name?
We happened to get on the same bus.
A unicycle has one wheel.
Tom told Mary that she was right.
Why don't you come over after school today?
Where can we buy it?
I've made my decision.
That's the computer on which he writes his articles.
Tom cried all night long.
You said that Tom wasn't hungry.
It's a fad.
Why won't my dog eat dog food?
The pen is mightier than the sword.
He glanced over the newspaper before turning in.
I want to be a teacher.
Tom got very nervous when he was suddenly asked to make a speech.
Do you think that's fair?
The station is a ten minute drive from here.

Tom is improving.
There are certainly some points worth considering.

We have nothing to complain about.

I'll call you in a couple of days.
Why don't you have a look?
A notice about the next meeting was posted on the door.
He told me that he would go to France in June.

You'll have to ask Tom.
Business is improving.
The number of tickets was limited.
Behave yourself.
It'll soon be October.
The situation's getting worse day by day.
This neighborhood is very dangerous.
Today's weather forecast says that it is likely to be fine tomorrow.
"You feel lonesome, don't you?"
I want him to be informed about that in advance.

There are two possible explanations.
Tom removed his coat.

Would you show me some rings?
Tom slid the ring on Mary's finger.
What do you say?
Can you hold on a little longer?
Why aren't you dancing?
Do you see me?
Who are you running from?

Both Tom and I work.
Did he get married when he was in Germany?
Tom would do that.

Tom cleaned the garage all by himself.
Where can I park my car?
Remember to shut the windows.
Everything is now back where it belongs.

This story is by far the most interesting of all.
The pain was almost unbearable.
This is a bird sanctuary.
We shouldn't have run that red light.
Keep doing what you're doing.
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
Don't you dare do that.
He was there on business.
The man I was talking to is my English teacher.
I have to take a rest.
What do you want me to see?
Tom is quite moody.
He moved close to her.
"Can you take me to the airport, please?"
He stole my heart.

I'd do almost anything for you.
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
That's a lot!
I have a lot of old books. A couple of them are quite valuable.
Tom said that he thought that Mary would be interested.
Light the candle.
He finally hit upon a solution to his problem.
That's my car.
"Get back before midnight, or you will be locked out."
I saw a strange woman there.
I am seeing Mary this afternoon.
Shall we begin?
Nobody cares what you think.
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
I sat down on the couch next to Tom.

How long does a bear sleep?
No one says that anymore.
Time will show which of us is right.

Do you want a drink?
Maybe you can get Tom to run the marathon with you.

Take only one.
I saw Tom yesterday in a restaurant. He was talking to a girl.
You make an interesting argument.
This room doesn't get much sunlight.
Does she like oranges?
I've just had new tires put on my car.
You ought to be ashamed.
It's an ambitious project.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the last train."
We want to talk to you about that.
I can understand French better than I can speak it.
I think we have to go.
I have to go to the doctor today.
Tom is completely unreliable.
There were a few large old wooden houses in the town.
You are by far the best swimmer of us all.
Could you please be quiet?
I'd like to know what happened.
What's your favorite image editing software?
I thought you said you were alone.
Don't you think you should tell Tom about this?

Don't come any closer.

The movie was almost three hours long.
Tom is a very good soccer player.
Red circles on the map mark schools.
Were you born here?
She has no sense of duty.
Lock it.
There's also a yellow one.
Everything was prepared well in advance.
You could have been happy.
We've already told Tom what he needs to do.
He is pleased with his new car.
Can you recommend a hotel near the airport?
We'll do it this way from now on.
This is all the money I have.
Where will you be on Monday?
She doesn't have any brothers.
I'm sure you're going to like this.
Do you have anything to say?
I found him the book.
Tom had a car accident.
I saw a UFO.
What was the fight over?
I am Chinese.
My father went to China.
Did you intend to kill Tom?
We haven't heard from Tom in ages.
Sometimes we need to take a step back and think.
It is possible that he is telling a lie.
Tom's older daughter is still unmarried.
It's easy to pick up bad habits.
Tom wondered if it was true.
Don't walk so fast.
"To tell the truth, I've already seen that movie."
What are you going to do there?
Tom has failed.
Don't you know it's rude to ask a lady her age?
Will you hand me that pencil?
Remember to set your alarm.
Tom ate out.
Tom felt woozy.
Turn the radio down a little.
"Tom found someone's business card in his pocket, but couldn't remember where he got it."
You must get ready quickly.
You said Tom asked you to ask me something.
Mary lived in a convent for a few months.
I'd like to ask you some questions now.
I told her what to do.
We're getting careless.
They sat around the table playing cards.
There was a group of children playing in the park.
There was nobody here yesterday.
It was very cold that winter.
Who spoke?
Why are you down here?
"Tom was supposed to be at school today, but he wasn't."
I want to know why you lied.
Who owns this villa?
They went to Chicago by car.
This book is sold here.
I am very dangerous.
Tom can get to work faster on bicycle than by car.
Tom wanted to quit practicing law.
Tom is standing nearby.
What was their explanation?
I think you've been watching too much TV.
Tom will need my help.
The train hasn't come yet.
This town is so small that you can easily learn everyone's names.
He left the Mexican capital to return to Texas.
Tom is a careful worker.
You need a holiday.
Have you had breakfast yet?
I hope he comes tomorrow.
Nobody volunteered.
He's hungry and thirsty.
Tom kissed Mary on the cheek and then got into his car.
I barely know you.
I'm the one you talked to on the phone.
We have not yet discussed which method is better.
I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
Your friend is tiresome.
Does this ring a bell?
You have taught him well.
Please make a milkshake for me.

How old are your children now?
You surprised everybody.
I am happy to hear your voice.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I am responsible for her protection.
How did you know I was Canadian?

I still believe the Internet is not a place for children.
I didn't expect this question.
Tom will be thrilled.
I hope you're prepared for that.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
I wish I could come up with a good answer to the question.
He's in the hospital.
I can't explain it now.
Tom spoke to the doctors in French.
Where did it all start?
It never occurred to me that he was the right man in the right place.
That's a good idea!
"In other words, he betrayed us."
I want to know why you don't like me.
Your daughter is not a child any more.
Tom told me that his father had passed away.
Stop torturing yourself.
Do you have an extra key?
May I direct your attention to this?
That's an interesting proposal. I'll think about it.
Tom may not be as good at French as you think.
It's what I would do.
The prince was changed into a frog.
I don't have to go.
Tom took out his key and opened the door.

The question is who decides what needs to be done.
Tom can generally be relied on to make good on his promises.

That coffee smells good.
Is the zither a hard instrument to learn?
Do you want to come?

Get down from there.
I don't regret it.
What are you guys going to do?
He tried to make both ends meet.
Why aren't you already on board the ship?
No one laughed.
I drank the water.
I'm in a jam.
That wasn't our fault.
This is not for you.
Please don't accuse me of something I didn't do.
I know you're going through a lot right now.
I understood that.
I like the people here.
Do you give to charity?
Have you ever grown a beard?

I respected Tom.
One year has twelve months.
I'm not your girlfriend.

May I use this telephone?

Pick up that paper there on the floor.
That's Tom's watch.
Do you think Tom is unreliable?
"Tom's room is at the end of the hall, on the right."
What's your favorite subject at school?
"When Tom ate some food that had fallen on the floor, Mary looked disgusted."
Whoever says so is a liar.
It doesn't matter anyway.
His mother was ashamed of him.
Sometimes I can't really grasp the meaning of a word.
I'm not mad at you.
Tom and I aren't Canadians.
I never meant to say anything about what happened.
Don't worry. I've done this a thousand times.

Tom couldn't rest.
I'm sending you a birthday present by airmail.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Don't ask me.
I'd like you to do the same.
How often do you eat out?

Tom took his finger off the trigger and put his pistol back in its holster.
You've got the wrong number.
"After dinner, we took a spin around town in my car."
Why couldn't you just ask someone for directions?

I suppose we're just lucky.
I want to play on the computer.
Did you really say that?
They hated Tom.
Shakespeare is the name of a writer.
Please let me know what you want.
I value our friendship more than anything.
Go out and play.
"Tom likes listening to American English the most, but he also likes the sound of Irish English."
I spent the summer vacation at my aunt's house.
Tom likes to read.
Open the door.
They really wanted to know what happened.
He forgot his wedding anniversary.
I'm going to America this summer.
Do you have a girlfriend now?
I'll check further into the matter.
Let the matter drop.
Maybe you'd better go get Tom.
I turned the computer off.
No one knows what's going on.
Tom died after stepping on a scorpion in the desert.
Tom was in the hospital.
Where do you go on Monday evenings?
I have a visa.
Tom cursed loudly.
How do you eat like that and keep your figure?
I really am busy.
I was given a nice watch by my uncle.
I have a friend whose father is a magician.
Control yourselves.
"How do you know that, Tom?"
I just have one question for you.
I taught myself how to play the guitar.
The life span of a butterfly is short.
What do you call this bird in English?
Tom can trust Mary.
Mary has not started yet.
I need to leave before Tom arrives.
We'd like to speak with Tom.
I wondered when you'd get here.
Where did you learn that?
Do you have a letter opener I can borrow?
That's fine with me.
You have made only a few spelling mistakes.
It hurt really bad.
He drew a deep breath.
He likes to build model planes.
How will you get them to help us?
Tom's plane is landing right now.
Tom still uses a typewriter.
Tell me where you got this.
I'm going to learn French.
Have your goals changed?
He's a bad liar.
Merlin was a wizard.
I won't take the bait.
My mother always told me I would be able do anything I wanted to do if I put my mind to it.
Something similar once happened to me.
Tom is not yet able to swim.
Tom and Mary worked in a coal mine as children.
I play tennis after school.
The battle was virtually over.
Leave it where you found it.
We're all related.
Tom is going through a midlife crisis.
I'm not doing this for you.
It's been a long time since we last saw each other.
He took his time.
He made no effort to accept his daughter's boyfriend.
It's for your own good.
Have you told Tom's mother?
How long can you hold your breath?
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
Why would he lie?
We're going to do what Tom said we should do.
Why are you angry with Tom?
"In judging his work, we must take his lack of experience into account."
I think I'm ready.
How's it coming?
The weather in Florida is generally moderate.
I'm fairly certain both Tom and Mary have already done that.
This hat cost me $10.
He was paralyzed by fear.
Have you chosen a topic?
Whose umbrella did you use?
I'll think about it.
Nothing's going on.
I tried to make sure that everyone had fun.
The boy peeped in at the window.
He worked hard.
Tom has been in the hospital for a long time.
You don't need to worry.
She is related to him by marriage.
Keep the door closed.
This time you must go there.
Show me how to do it.
That's strange.
Tennis is loads of fun.
Tom's dog bit him playfully.
What good do you think that'll do?
Tom heard the front door slam.
Some stars are hardly visible to the naked eye.
That is why he got angry.
My friend was shot.
I have some other appointments.
Tom said that.
I am badly in need of your help.
Should we call Tom?
I just want people to like me.
Is the cat on the chair or under the chair?
He's addicted to drugs.
I must speak with you alone.
It's strange that Tom hasn't come yet.
Take your time. I know you need a couple of days to reflect on it.
She substituted margarine for butter.
I must find it.
I'm a little out of practice.
Can I come to your office tomorrow?
"If he hadn't taken that flight then, he would be alive now."
What illness do I have?
I never learned to swim.
Can you give me an example?
I'm illiterate.
I'll call you later today.
Clean up your room.
The boy is kind.
Let's not rule anything out.
The true secret of writing a good letter is to write as if you were talking.
Tom drove me to the airport.
She's unfit for the job.
Tom looks like his father.
Do you really want me to tell Tom that you were the one who killed his father?
I think we have to risk it.
"It's a town of 3,000 people."
Tom asked Mary several questions.
It was a trap.
Horses can sense fear.
What'll Tom do?
I ran away from home when I was thirteen.
I need to find someone who can help me.
I didn't even notice Tom.
I think she'll help me.
Tom ate his lunch at his desk.
Nuclear weapons may bring about the annihilation of man.
What do I have to lose?
Do you translate lyrics?
The cats are purring.
One language is never enough.
When will it begin?
You should try to learn a little French.
The meeting finished thirty minutes ago.
Please knock before entering.
Break it down.
What I need is more time.
She picked up the phone.
This sentence is fine.
"That company puts out a magazine, doesn't it?"
You used to be my hero.
You seem to want to know what to do.
Tom embraced his son.
"Where is my classroom? ""It's on the third floor."""
"French is difficult, isn't it?"
Is that supposed to happen?
We still need your help.
He just wants attention.
Tom has enough money to buy any computer in this store. He just needs to decide which one.
I don't expect you to forgive me.
I wholeheartedly agree.
Unbuckle your seat belt.
Tom's name was at the top of the list.
"Give me something to write with. ""Will this do?"" ""Yes, it will do."""
Enjoy your trip.
English is not easy for me.
My mistake cost me my fortune.
Don't even think about it.
It's unbelievable.
Did you shoot Tom?
It is twenty minutes past ten.
Tom has a nice camera.
Tom got over his cold.
I like your frankness.
The couple spent a lot of money on furnishing their house.
I can't afford to rent a house like this in Tokyo.
Nothing is as important as peace.
I don't really have a gun.
Would you like to see my new trombone?
You had better go and speak to him in person.
Tom opened the safe.
"What I want isn't tea, but coffee."
You give up too easily.
Tom probably doesn't know where Mary used to live.
Would you forgive me?
Tom isn't able to do his job anymore.
He looks like his father.
I ate a salad for lunch.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
Tom died a day later.
Machines that his company produces are superior to ours.
He lingered in the classroom after school was over.
The farmer sowed his field with wheat.
My aunt gave me an album.
I don't know whether Tom still lives here or not.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
The news depressed him very much.
This watch is far better than that one.
He is good at playing tennis.
Tom isn't drinking green tea.
My computer is very slow.
We ended up going home early.
"I can drive a car, but Tom can't."
I'll take it up with Tom.
Did I forget to write the date?
A doctor tried to remove the bullet from his back.
My cat and dog get along.
Put your hands in the air.
Tom picked up one of his gloves and put it on.
Tom speaks French as if he were a native speaker.
I'm happy to see you again.
Did you go to Harvard?
Tom is a good student.
Tom and Mary both work at the same supermarket.
I'd love to sing for you.
Tom landed his helicopter on the roof.
How did you know Tom would be there?
He sometimes forgets to take books back to the library.
I'm reading the New York Times.
"Since I was tired, I took a nap."
He's proud of his good grades.
You can't make me do anything I don't want to do.
He made me a new suit.
I have nothing to wear.
He wanted to meet you.
Have you ever been abroad?
I used to play tennis when I was a student.
Tom was the only one without enough money for the trip.
Tom shot at Mary.
Can Tom be counted upon?
Watch your fingers!
Tom crossed something off his list.
I won't eat breakfast today.
We like swimming in the ocean.
"Here's your bill, sir."
I am happy to meet you.
I don't like to think about it.
"Please, tell me."
"Wait, you guys."
It sounds like you learned a valuable lesson.
She's Tom's sister.
Don't get me started.
You won't regret this.
It is twenty minutes past ten.
How was the weather yesterday?
There is an urgent need for qualified teachers.
You can't make bricks without straw.
This isn't my key.
Won't you get in trouble for this?
Is it too small?
I don't want to write with this pen.
Did Tom smile?
I don't feel very confident.
I became very nervous when I couldn't locate my passport.
Don't let the fire burn out.
We're coming to get you.
How do you spell your last name?
Who is this Tom you always talk about?
"Tom has lied to me in the past, so I don't trust him anymore."
Are you about to do it?
She attributed her success to good luck.
Why don't you just apologize?
All the stories are interesting.
Tonight sounds good.
The talisman he's wearing is supposed to ward off evil spirits.
Tom is chatting with his friends.
Have you ever fed a crocodile?
Let's go!
I dare say he is right.
Tom is able to speak French.
A dog can run faster than a man can.
I didn't mind doing that at all.
I don't think this chain will stand the strain.
Can you translate this for me?
I didn't want to insult Tom.
Our professor postponed the exam until next week.
You seem unreliable.
He has the backing of a certain politician.
Did you get stuck in traffic?
Mary is getting on my nerves.
You can't believe anybody.
How am I going to get home?
"Written in technical terms, this book is very difficult to understand."
You can ski on that hill.
The police returned fire.
I am always proud of my family.
A good idea came to mind.
"Ever since Tom died, things haven't been the same."
She heard him sing.
I came to see how you're doing.
He did his work painstakingly.
Which one do you like best?
I thought Tom did a nice job.
Tom spends too much time on the computer.
It's not a problem.
Sulfur is used to make matches.
Stop lying to me.
The mountain is about 3000 meters above sea level.
I think I'm ready.
Don't you have any money?
I didn't see her.
Do you know where Tom was hiding?
I thought that I saw something.
Do you know who I am?
There used to be a large park here.
I wish I had a room of my own.
And why would I do that?
It's very nice of you.
Tom picked up his stuff and put it in his briefcase.
All children do not like apples.
Many Asians are lactose intolerant.
Play us a tune.
No one wants to talk about books anymore.
This apple is sweet.
Have you ever had a heart attack?
Tom crosses the railroad tracks every morning on his way to work.
The worth of friendship is greater than gold.
We are giving Tom a party on his birthday.
Tom has a ten-speed bicycle.
This is my mother.
Tom hasn't got much money with him.
The doctor advised me not to eat too much.
I had to go to work.
I want you here tomorrow by 2:30.
I went home and cried.
An eagle was soaring high up in the air.
The coat I wanted was priced at three hundred dollars.
I'm not coming.
Tom should be around thirty by now.
I can't for the life of me remember her phone number.
Keep your fingers crossed.
Tom wants respect.
I found this when I was cleaning out my closet today.
I don't know who my mother is.
Don't go near the dog.
Tom is a good pilot.
The referee blew his whistle to end the match.
You're worried.
She looks like her mother.
I'll lend you the tools that you need to do that.
Tom sounded happy.
What's your favorite fast-food restaurant?
I need to focus.
Tom's an irritating person to work with because he'll never admit it when he's made a mistake.
I need to talk to Tom about what he said he would do.
Please go away.
Keep your eye on him.
"I can hear you, but I can't see you."
I'd like to be more than just friends.
He translated the verse into English.
Why didn't you just pay Tom?
Self-diagnosis can be dangerous.
Cheese is made from milk.
Tom doesn't have the right to say that.
I don't know how to go there.
Has Tom ever been in love?
"Are you from Boston, too?"
Tom doesn't get along with his sisters.
It serves you right.
This is me eating a banana.
Circumstances have changed.
Tom felt ashamed.
I've never seen one like that.
I like music better than sports.
I can't believe it's already time to go home.
I take my camera with me wherever I go.
Tom poked the fire with a stick.
I think you'd better go and visit him.
Do you have any French-speaking employees?
Tom has gained weight since I last saw him.
Nobody noticed that she was absent until the meeting ended.
The teacher was worried by Tom's frequent absence from class.
Tom is interested in painting.
Where am I?
Tom wanted to say goodbye.
I've made a lot of stupid mistakes in my life.
Do you speak English?
Hurry up! The train is about to leave.
You can rest.
How do you feel about the Gulf War?
She was too tired to speak.
Even the strongest man can't stop a typhoon.
Tom bought his truck used.
It's not the end of the world.
Friends are always willing to help each other.
He is not any taller than I am.
The little boy sat on his father's shoulders.
Tom has little chance of winning the election.
Don't worry. The ambulance will be here soon.
"The house has a dining room, a bedroom and a study."
The president and his entourage were injured.
No one knew it.
I guess they really weren't so hungry.
Tom didn't seem interested in anything else.
Did you find anything in the room?
My plan is different from yours.
You're exposing yourself to a lot of criticism.
Tom will carry those suitcases for you.
Persons under age are prohibited from smoking.
Don't keep bad company.
I knew that.
Is that your umbrella?
The cat ruined my sofa.
I can't wait to see you.
True beauty comes from within.
Is it OK if I open a can?
I think Tom is smarter than Mary.
I started learning English six years ago.
Do you know what it says?
The meat is tough.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another engagement.
Do you know what I mean?
I think he takes after his father.
Tom had other things he wanted to do.
You're never satisfied.
I once saw a man walk barefoot over hot coals.
Think outside the box.
You may come and see me once a week.
I lost everything.
You don't have the nerve.
Why are you giving it to me?
English has become my favorite subject.
A bear will not touch a dead body.
They regarded him as the best doctor in town.
There's somebody waiting for you outside.
Tom knew that this would happen.
You can rest.
This is all the money I have.
He is our English teacher.
What did she do to you?
I wonder whether Tom misses me.
This car is quite safe.
It is thirty meters in length.
"Her hands are small, but not so small that she can't play the piano."
Would you like to travel to the United States?
Tom tried his luck hitchhiking.
I like red wine better than white.
I only have 24 hours left to decide.
I can tear you apart with my bare hands.
The plane from Chicago arrived at the airport late at night.
"Just as he was getting the hang of things, he got fired."
He usually gets up at six.
"On that day, Japanese flags were flying."
He was snoring loudly while he slept.
The roller coaster was really scary.
Tom and I are well.
They applauded.
Mary wants to sweep the house.
He's looking good.
What do we owe you?
That class had a substitute teacher for the first week of school.
I don't know exactly where.
French is the language of love.
You can have this.
Tom may eat whatever he wants to.
"Tom, put your money away. I'm paying this time."
I was not pleased.
Tom sounded almost proud of that.
"Isn't that your car, Tom?"
The basements of the houses are likely to have problems.
Is there a bus stop nearby?
Tom still lives at home.
Am I supposed to leave now?
I guess that will have to do.
You may choose whichever you want.
I need to remember to buy some milk.
I can't play tennis.
He's aware of his own faults.
"No matter what happens, I won't be surprised."
Where's Tom now?
She poured milk into the cup.
Are you waiting for me to do it?
Did you yell at Tom?
What made you do this?
You look like a freak.
Tom couldn't persuade Mary to leave.
"Take your passport with you, just in case."
Why do we have to go home?
How long do I have to stay here?
Is there a good restaurant somewhere near here?
Is your salary keeping up with inflation?
I didn't know you were so tired.
What does everybody else think?
Tom and Mary are both very frightened.
They approve.
He has a bright future.
I got an A in French.
I am familiar with this neighborhood.
Do you hear something?
We really enjoyed our meal.
Tom has the necessary experience.
He is no relation to me.
Tom is respectful.
There is no film in this camera.
What's in the beach bag that's in the trunk of your car?
Please light a candle.
What are we going to do with it?
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
Tom is white as a sheet.
I assume that was the only way to get the job done in time.
"As soon as they return, I will telephone you."
The crew found a stowaway.
I thought we said 2:30.
His hands were empty.
You shouldn't spend more money than you earn.
The ship went up in flames.
"Hey, it's snowing."
"Tom didn't feel well, but he went to work anyway."
Maybe we're both mistaken.
We know where it is.
I didn't find it funny at all.
Why don't you ask your boyfriend?
Tom is no longer my boyfriend.
Tom has a terrible crush on Mary.
"If you were an animal, what animal would you be?"
Her mother started screaming.
Let's take a ten-minute break.
What's so special about that?
Tom is a beekeeper.
This hotel has valet parking.
I spoke in a voice loud enough to be heard by everyone.
He admitted that he had committed the crime.
The door to Tom's room was closed.
Tom said he couldn't wait any longer.
I am happy to hear your voice.
What are you doing next Monday?
Listen to this!
Have you seen anything unusual lately?
How bad do you want it?
Can you whistle?
I need to talk to you.
They each have a piece of the puzzle.
I'm glad you were right.
I've come a long way.
Is there a place we can speak privately?
Do you want a massage?
That was the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
Tom has been asking questions about you.
We need to work together in order to make the world a better place.
I have many discs.
Tom put his hands in his pockets.
He lifted the trunk to show off his strength.
She acted the part of a fairy.
"In some countries, the punishment for treason can be life in prison."
I forgot the train tickets.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
He's a Chinese-American.
Tom misses his wife.
Grab my hand.
It is a childish act.
He won't turn up tonight.
Tom is just pretending.
I'd like to learn French.
It's not difficult to learn Dutch.
It isn't new.
It's up to you to decide the matter.
You can't imagine how humiliating this is.
Are you sure that Tom is behind this?
The doctor examined the patient.
What's Tom doing here?
Tom said you were too busy to talk to us.
Tom likes to be busy and hates sitting around doing nothing.
It's really annoying.
You gave me your word.
I have to say goodbye to some friends.
I've given you my answer already.
There is a bench on the balcony.
Tom was the most handsome man at Mary's party.
I gave my word to Tom that I wouldn't do that.
Am I still welcome here?
Are you still having trouble with that?
I guess Tom is sick.
Was that you in the car?
Twelve years is old for a dog.
I never want to see your face again.
What you say makes no sense.
Don't take any unnecessary risks.
Tom is analytical.
I'm a lot heavier than you.
Did you see anybody there?
Tom is resentful.
It's difficult to reconcile all the opinions.
Let me handle Tom.
All of them went there.
Tom woke up at midnight.
Are you trying to grow a beard?
Tom picked up one of the glass vases and threw it at Mary.
Tom didn't miss anything.
She needs you.
Close your eyes.
Tom and Mary were sitting across from each other at a table on the veranda.
Leave now.
My shirt is orange.
She ran as fast as she could.
"If you take medicine, you will feel better."
You may enter.
Enjoy yourselves.
Tom has three children to support.
I'll do it as soon as I can.
I always take the bus.
A little bird told me.
They invited me to the party.
"He gives plain, simple explanations."
It could be anywhere.
The noise is going to wake the baby.
Can I speak with you a moment?
She denied having met him.
We need to find alternatives.
Promise me you'll come back.
Will you explain the last part in detail?
What are you doing?
Keep the secret to yourself.
Is it true that you were on TV yesterday?
I can't tell you what it's for.
I know why Tom doesn't like you.
Tom has been there since 2013.
"Tom is in Australia, it seems."
Let's ask him.
Tom is training for a marathon.
Why did they fire Tom?
Lambs are baby sheep.
I don't want to get my hands dirty.
Children learn by watching what adults around them do.
How old were you when you started studying French?
Tom doesn't like my family.
Tom doesn't have one.
Tom had a son.
Tom yelled for help.
Did you get my messages?
Every student has free access to the library.
I hope you have brains enough to see the difference.
He has a heart of gold.
Myanmar is ruled by a military dictatorship.
You wouldn't believe it.
The students sat in a circle.
His long speech bored everyone.
Tom was accused of falling asleep on guard duty.
Can you tell us where you were at 2:30 this afternoon?
He lives comfortably.
Am I safe now?
Tom saw the news.
I'd like to be alone now.
Tom is very timid.
I've never seen him wearing jeans.
"Whose notebooks are these? ""They are Karim's."""
The landlord won't permit him to paint the door red.
Tom is hiding from Mary.
The company gave him a gold watch in acknowledgement of his services.
You can have three guesses.
Do you know what's in that box?
Tom wants to become a priest.
Tom is liked by everybody.
Won't you have another cup of coffee?
They swam.
Tom sat down on the couch beside Mary.
I live ten miles from the city.
Where are you all going so early in the morning?
She nodded in response to my question.
Did you poison Tom?
He turned up the volume on the television.
How do you take your coffee?
Were you scolded by your teacher?
Which drinks don't you like?
I saw nothing.
May all your dreams come true.
Tom sold his company to Mary.
I found your keys.
This website can damage your computer.
Tom broke his left ankle during a rugby match.
Did you bring rolls?
Tom could read before he started going to school.
Tom is going to be waiting for Mary in front of the library at 2:30.
We're meditating.
What are you up to these days?
Tom must be nearly thirty.
She was beautiful when she was young.
"It seems like you know me, but I don't know you."
The servants' screams awakened everyone.
I promise I won't forget it.
Tom usually works from nine to five-thirty.
Who created the universe?
I'll sue you.
The TV remote control is under the couch.
We got married very young.
"Five gallons of regular, please."
"I was going to write to you, but I started doing other things and forgot."
He has a good chance of being chosen.
This is a good place to build a sand castle.
Do you think it's funny?
"This tree is tall, but that one is even taller."
I remember it all.
I saw Tom take it.
Can you climb the tree?
"What he said applies, to a certain extent, to this case."
It was almost noon when I woke up.
Are you sure you want to do this by yourself?
He got up early this morning.
I can't let you leave.
I can do without this.
I must have forgotten it.
Did you speak to Tom about this?
I'm not accustomed to getting up early.
She saw him eating a sandwich.
Tom is a very easy-going guy.
I haven't gotten over my cold yet.
Is Tom at school?
You'll all get used to the cold climate in no time.
This is out of control.
"I wanted a hamburger, but I restrained myself."
You cannot substitute money for health.
This time I'll pay.
A pretty waitress waited on us.
We hired a crane to lift the new air conditioner and place it on the roof.
She made him cry.
Tom told everybody that he was exhausted.
It's hot today.
I just don't want you to do something you'll be sorry for.
I need to go home.
Tom and Mary were whispering to each other.
This truck is in need of repair.
Tom was dubious.
Tom put his arm around Mary's waist.
Everybody was excited by the news.
She is aged seventeen.
He doesn't care about anything.
A cold wave hit this district.
I'm glad that I still live here.
"Where did you two meet? ""We met on a trip through the Carpathians, and we immediately fell in love with each other."""
It won't be easy persuading Mary to go.
I'll get you for this.
I ask your forgiveness.
This material will stand up to lots of washings.
Why do we have to decide this today?
Tom must be Mary's father.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
When did I give you that?
Tom and Mary were talking to each other.
It will cost 500 dollars to fly to Paris.
Tom is wearing a hearing aid.
Please allow me to say a few words on this occasion.
What does it contain?
I can't let Tom see me like this.
It'll take a long time.
This isn't for sale.
Tom looks down on women.
Is there an inexpensive hotel somewhere around here?
Tom wondered how deep the river was.
Tom believes that Mary is innocent.
Tom is exceptionally good-looking.
I don't know who you're talking about.
"Tom put together one million dollars in unmarked, used bills as the kidnappers had told him to do."
You can forget about that.
"Copy this, please."
He made his way through the crowd.
His doctoral thesis must be submitted to the professor by the end of the month.
"Speaking of hobbies, do you collect stamps?"
Get away!
I can't believe you're trying to bribe me.
I think I would have heard gunshots if there had been any.
Tom doesn't have what it takes to be a race car driver.
She went to Italy for the purpose of studying music.
Tom can't be that naive.
Have you spent a lot of time in therapy?
They were about 25 cents a pound cheaper.
I'm not the only one who was absent.
He left his hometown on a cold morning.
"Sorry, we're full today."
Don't put your greedy hands on my money.
I often played baseball when I was young.
That's his horse.
I seldom hear from him.
I'm listening to you.
He's a fanatic.
Tom thought Mary was busy.
Tom just stood there staring like an idiot.
What did Tom bring?
I love him.
The restaurant is next door to the theater.
I found the new magazine very interesting.
This is not my specialty.
I think that my suitcase was stolen.
Tom put a stick of gum into his mouth.

Get started.
The frail old man stubbornly refused to make use of a wheelchair.

I'd rather die than leave.
Prices keep on soaring.
He came again after a week.
Your French is good.
That's terrible.
He turned Christian.

They'll come looking for Tom.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
Tom doesn't have a car and neither does Mary.
"As far as I know, he isn't lazy."
She wouldn't even speak to him.
There are many good reasons not to do it.
Tom thinks that he's always right.
It's my personal favorite.
Have a nice day.
Who'll get there the quickest?
"The sooner you leave, the better."
I finally passed that test.
"You don't want to tell me why, do you?"

It was well after midnight when Tom got home.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?

Please come here.

Are you the new teacher?
I asked Tom to leave.
He wants to make fun of me.
You're very versatile.
Why didn't Tom tell us?
I would rather let him have his own way.
He leaned against the wall.
I don't deserve to live.
I haven't seen you for ages.
Would you lend me your pencil?
I don't want to see you.
The problem is that we don't have enough money.
Don't get fat.
My advice is for you to go home.
The girls had a catfight.
I want to be famous.
Write to me as soon as you get there.

They've found survivors.
I'm the only person Tom knows in this town.
"To my relief, he came home safe and sound."
"Tom was dressed, as always, in black."
I heard that Tom is going to get married soon.
You must read between the lines.
I've heard a lot about you.
Can you please help me put price tags on everything?
I am downloading books.
How often do you wash your clothes?
The students ought to study more.
That's our number one priority.

Do you have change for a fifty?
Are you going to the class reunion?
It cannot be helped.
Tom can't be much older than Mary.
Let's hide behind the curtain.
I think Tom can be trusted.
"So, how did you like it?"
"Excuse me, but could you tell me the way to the bus stop?"
The man's behavior was very odd.
It's a very touching story.
What do you want with us?
Get a doctor in here.
We're out of toilet paper.
We should've let the police handle the problem.
You can go home if you like.
Please turn off the television.
There is a little wine left in the bottom of the glass.
"How many girls do you have? ""I only have one."""
We usually call him Tom.
What's the minimum wage in your country?

It was tremendously exciting to be in Boston at that time.
Where are you going to be?
He wrapped his arms around me.
She was at the scene of the crime.
I outsmarted Tom.
Tom stayed calm.
Tom is the victim of a terrible crime.
I went into the town in search of a good restaurant.
We hope for peace.
Do you prefer for television shows to be subtitled or dubbed?
She is not afraid to die.
Tom didn't believe that Mary had anything to do with the theft.
You are right in a way.
"I think that Tom and only Tom can do it. However, some people think that Mary could do it, too."
She was injured in the car accident.

"Hey, what's going on in here?"
The sirens went off.
Perhaps you could suggest something we can do tomorrow.
There are no witnesses.
I'm not a violent person.
Tom believes Mary made the right choice.
Tom is quite a poet.
She says she will call you later.
The streetcar was packed.
"Generally speaking, Americans like coffee."
Don't you know what to do?
Tom is loyal to his wife.
Your watch is similar to mine in shape and color.
Why aren't you saying anything?
You desperately need a vacation.
That helped a lot.
Tom said he isn't going to Mary's party.
Please feed the dog every day.
I'm sure Tom will forgive you if you explain everything to him.
Let's play cards a while.
Who did you hear that rumor from?
Thanks for helping me fix my car.
Tom became quiet.
Look at that one.
Don't forget to send the letter.
"She rarely, if ever, goes out of town."
A pretty girl lived in that village.
This battle left Napoleon master of Europe.
He has seen better days.
Tom likes spaghetti.
I might be able to answer that question.
I accept your challenge.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Why are we having this conversation?
The author's name is familiar to us.
My aunt enjoyed good health all her life.
It's a shame the way old people are treated.
I don't owe him anything.
They love me.
You could never do that.
A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes.
Mary slapped Tom.
Yes. You're absolutely right.
I need to get to this meeting now.
Please think it over.
I'm not overly interested in the event.
Tom likes to look at pictures of cats.
I was wondering if you'd let me stay with you for a few days.
I'm the man of the house.
I was foolish enough to believe him.
I like what I've seen so far.
He is always joking.
What will we do with the leftover bread?
We can't keep doing this.
I want to talk to you about Tom.
Are you sure Tom was the one who did this?
Tom doesn't smile very often.
He walked slowly so the child could follow.
Tom seems to be having a heart attack.
Do you want to find out?
I will be with you right away.
Do you want another one of these?
I've been living here for many years.
She took care of my dog.
"Excuse me, what did you say?"
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.
It sounds terribly complicated.
That is why so many students are absent today.
Have you ever been to Disneyland?
I recommend caution.
I like to eat watermelon.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
You're not as young as Tom.
He was given an important mission.
I'm happy to see you again.
It's there now.
I have just finished eating.
"That's interesting, but beside the point."
I like to watch baseball games.
Tom knew what Mary was planning to do.
Take my word for it.
I can't feel at home in a hotel.
He does not care for ice cream.
I'm going to teach you some karate.
You're just not the person I thought you were.
I think it's going to work.
I don't like you either.
I'm asking what you think.
Tom wanted to know where we were going.
We're having a sukiyaki party this Sunday.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
They are melons.
I've been worried sick about you.
Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
I saw a house in the distance.
How far is it to the airport?
Let me speak to Tom first.
What's this thing?
They haven't fixed a date for their wedding yet.
The experiment was successful.
My father died when I was seven years old.
Tom slipped into the classroom unnoticed.
He is allergic to dust.
"Sometimes, I feel like everyone is ignoring me."
I didn't think you would come.
I think you're trying too hard.
Is that what you think of me?
Tom should've done it the way you told him to do it.
"Tom wanted to ask Mary out, but he was afraid she would say no."
That's the problem we have to solve.
I don't want to hear this.
Declarations of variables are extremely important in C and C++.
Turn up the TV.
Where did it happen?
What you are saying does not make sense.
I never see a library without wishing I had time to go there and stay till I had read everything in it.
I can't bring myself to do such a thing.
The boy talks as if he were a man.
Remember to shut the windows.
Tom made me look stupid.
I must object to this plan.
It's important for us to think about the future of the world.
Sit still.
Tom's confused.
He doesn't know English at all.
We live near the border.
Tom felt confused.
He had the misfortune to lose all his money.
It looks very good.
He tried to unify the various groups.
I'm going home to be with Tom.
I found the box empty.
Could you give me a ride to the station?
I try.
"Having read the book, I could answer all the questions."
You always take things too seriously.
My little brother is watching TV.
This organization cannot exist without you.
I certainly don't blame you.
You've done so much already.
Why does it have to be me?
Tom doesn't live here.
The police covered the body with a sheet.
I'm all ears.
I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to.
I'm surprised that he accepted the offer.
I'm afraid of death.
What's the weight of your suitcase?
He wants to play tennis when he's older.
Tom shook everybody's hands.
You can't smoke in school.
She's dancing with another man.
This task is too much for him.
What did you do yesterday?
Tom can get it.
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
Tom thought Mary was stupid.
She touched him on the shoulder.
I've just turned 20.
I want you to come to Boston.
I baked these cookies for you.
I'd like to know how Tom got there.
Which party do you belong to?
He's an old friend of mine.
I know how happy you are.
I love you with all my heart.
Why does Tom want to go there?
You were right and I was wrong.
Why is there no hot water?
Where is the ticket office?
I asked Tom if he wanted to go to Boston with me.
Has that been scientifically proven?
We are at home today.
I don't know a thing about her.
I don't know why they do it.
Who will compensate for the loss?
Don't be so hard on her. She meant well.
Tom likes to do things like that.
They didn't listen.
I guess it's only a joke.
The meeting has already begun.
Don't make a fool of me.
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
How long did you stay in Boston?
Tom didn't do it on purpose.
Don't you have to go to school today?
Nothing I do is appreciated.
Do you have anything to tell me?
I rely on Tom.
Tom was the first one to enter the room.
I wonder whether Tom knows how to speak French.
The voyage to America used to take many weeks.
I tried not to cry.
They're all older than you.
Tom is a disc jockey.
Tom's doubts have been confirmed.
Tom said I shouldn't be doing this.
I want you to sing.
They eat a lot of rice.
Do you know a quiet place we can talk?
We discussed the problem.
Tom realized that Mary had been lying to him.
I'm afraid of the dark.
I wish I hadn't kissed you.
What are you sorry about?
We had a heated discussion.
Tom often wears sunglasses.
I turned right.
The village in which he was born is far from here.
I'll give Tom that.
Tom doesn't have to do it here.
I'm glad you like our house.
Why don't you come over after work today?
I couldn't have done it without you.
When did you ask Tom?
Is there a supermarket near here?
Everybody cries sometimes.
His name is on the tip of my tongue.
She was always quarreling with her parents.
He left the door unlocked.
Do you really think that your plans are realistic?
We had a short vacation in February.
Try and stop me.
She opened her eyes.
Is everybody happy?
Keep the child away from the pond.
I hope you don't get lost.
She has a good figure.
A gigantic bird came flying toward him.
You hid the truth from me.
He promised to write every day.
See you tomorrow.
There's not much you can do about it.
There are no easy answers.
Most people don't drink enough water.
There was blood on Tom's face.
The distance from the sun to the earth is about 93 million miles.
Tell me where Tom's hideout is.
I'm sorry for what I did.
I thought Tom would never stop talking.
I arrived three days ago.
Today I got to meet my new philosophy teacher.
Can't you leave me alone?
I've only had one boyfriend.
There is no sense in your worrying about your health so much.
Mary is wearing a wetsuit.
Tom's house was destroyed by a hurricane.
I think we could beat them.
Tom regrets not doing what his father recommended.
The dogs started barking.
I think Tom is prejudiced.
"You don't speak English, do you?"
I want Tom to go home.
I need a clean shirt.
Tom says he feels a lot better today.
The dress is green.
I’m on a diet right now.
You can't please everyone.
Tom is going to miss me.
It can be confusing at first.
Do you have a family?
Tom now lives with his dad.
Our team lost all of its games.
It's crawling with spiders.
I intend to do that by tomorrow.
We don't have a garden.
We stayed at an economy hotel.
He's a Frenchman.
"Last week I was at the beach, but today I'm home."
I read about how to make tempura in a book.
This is simply amazing.
Did you change your mind?
Don't tilt your chair back.
Maybe Tom didn't see us.
What do you want to protect us from?
This is my book.
Do you like spinach?
Tom didn't know what Mary thought of it.
"If I were you, I would go home and take a good rest."
This book is heavy.
I'll ask Mary out.
Compare your answer with Tom's.
She needs it.
He managed to be on time for class.
"Tom, are you and John brothers?"
Do you understand what you're saying?
The tire leaks air.
What time does this restaurant close?
I have a foreign object in my left ear.
My bag is empty.
When will we meet?
Thousands of people died during the plague.
Is this book yours?
They weren't able to discover any secrets.
Take this medicine.
Say it again.
Please do not leave your luggage unattended.
Isn't that curious?
This work is beyond me.
"You lost, didn't you?"
Do you want to go to Boston with me?
Her father is tall.
The cat arched its back and stretched itself.
I'm not sure who wrote this report.
Tom certainly helped make this a better place to live.
How much longer do you think it'll be?
We don't live here.
I need to stop thinking about Tom.
I just can't help.
What did you buy her for Christmas?
His daughter is a nurse.
Tom is disorganized.
You're too suspicious about everything.
Would you mind waiting a few minutes?
Have pity on me.
Our love will last forever.
I kept an eye on her suitcase.
The tragedy must be remembered so that it is not repeated.
I agree to your proposal.
"Whenever she goes shopping, she ends up buying more than she can afford."
We were very sleepy the next morning.
What's going on up there?
The ice cracked under the weight.
This is your fate.
How did you do that without our help?
There is nothing to cancel.
I have nothing to complain about.
The roads are jammed with cars.
I could actually see myself living here.
"The color green is often associated with money and the world of finance, because banknotes in many countries are green."
I told you you'd be disappointed.
We stood face to face with death.
He was jealous of my success.
Why do you laugh so hard at his jokes? They're not even funny.
We talked to each other for a while.
She turned down my proposal.
Tom was healthy.
I'm not finished.
"On February 14th, Americans celebrate Valentine's Day."
What would make you happy?
This is his only chance.
Tom filled the balloon with helium.
We are soccer players.
I have a son not much older than you.
Tom wouldn't believe me.
Tom probably wanted to just stay at home and go to sleep.
That won't be easy.
Maybe I haven't explained it well.
Tom was interested in that.
I don't want you to quit correcting my mistakes.
She retaliated against him by ignoring him.
I just don't understand you anymore.
I come from a big family.
He wants to marry my daughter.
Now you know how I feel.
Everyone is different.
What are you after?
I've read both books.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
She stayed here by herself.
All at once the sky became dark and it started to rain.
I can't go on Saturday.
That was a good time.
It must be done more carefully.
You had your sister really worried.
She advised him not to go.
I solved the problem a few days ago.
It cost me 100 yen to send the letter.
My father does not always walk to work.
This question is by no means easy.
What should we do with people who are very sick or hurt and can't get better?
Tom gave Mary some practical advice.
The native people were forced off their land.
The United States' Civil War lasted four years.
How are you now?
How long has Tom been working here?
I panicked and ran.
They cleared the street of snow.
Dogs are smart.
I ride a bike to work.
Somebody's got to talk to Tom.
He studies day and night.
Are you still looking for something to do?
Nothing changes.
That's not what I think.
It's very hard to understand.
The traffic accident prevented me from catching the train.
That wasn't your fault.
Tom died of an overdose.
The main character is a man whose name we do not know.
They are deeply in love.
I hate it when you pretend like you don't know me.
Do snakes scare you?
You don't have to be a genius to know who said that.
That is a useful piece of information.
Nobody else showed up.
Tom is playing fetch with his dog.
Do not let go of the rope till I tell you.
She's already rich even though she's only 26 years old.
Could you use my help?
He was foolish enough to believe it.
Tom got confused.
I bet this will work.
The cottage was clean and tidy.
I know you can make it better.
I'll see you Saturday.
These pills will ease the pain.
That'll put you in danger.
I'm not good at telling jokes.
Nobody's going to judge you.
"Tom has a good grasp of grammar, but is weak in spelling."
Let's start at the beginning.
They call me captain.
"At last, her dream to be a doctor came true."
Does Coca-Cola contain caffeine?
She helped him get over his bad mood.
"If you're not out of the shower in five minutes, I'm cutting the hot water!"
"Having finished it, he went to bed."
Tom was afraid that Mary would say no.
Tom is eating ice cream.
The wall had a crack in it.
I wonder if Tom lied to us about that.
I've got no time for that now.
My initials are on my briefcase.
What about us?
"We have a lot of things do to. ""Such as?"""
"I don't have a bicycle, let alone a car."
They have something in common.
Men are better at this than women.
It's good to see you.
I expect you to treat Tom with respect.
He came back from America.
How many cigarettes am I allowed to take back duty free?
I no longer love you.
There is no denying the fact that no one is free from racial prejudice.
I told you we had a lot in common.
Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
Things are about to change.
Tom was skiing.
Can you stand up?
Tom was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Tom is ready to go out.
Let's hope we did the right thing.
What a coincidence meeting you here!
There is always something happening here.
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
He’s shivering because of the cold.
Big people aren't always strong.
She wouldn't speak to him.
That was very careless of you.
That ticket is good until April 29th.
Heat turns ice into water.
Tom is often late for work.
Tom doesn't like chess.
Tom won't be able to do anything about the problem this week.
The weather suddenly got warmer.
Tom asked Mary to get some glasses from the kitchen.
Tom seemed afraid.
We can't let Tom go.
There's enough food for all of you.
She used to love him.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"As a young man, he did not know that he was to become famous later on."
Tom isn't a good cook.
I've always gotten along very well with Tom.
They say this old house is haunted.
"That's interesting, but not important."
Our problems are nothing compared to hers.
Tom has been generous.
Is he a friend of yours?
Please feel free to ask questions.
We should wait for help.
She's too young to get a driver's license.
"Tom used to kiss Mary goodbye every morning, but he doesn't anymore."
I asked Tom if he was OK.
Are you sure you don't want coffee?
"In case of an emergency, push this button."
I don't understand a thing.
Tom didn't want Mary to stay any longer.
Tom is really fast.
I'm not very optimistic.
I hope you get well soon.
Tom died unexpectedly.
I'm going to report you to police.
What do you want from us?
She doesn't speak to me.
Tom is right-handed.
He loves traveling.
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Translate the underlined sentences.
I won't let you go alone.
I haven't seen Tom in ages.
I'm planning to stay at the hotel.
Grab Tom.
I want to see your boss.
I was calling my friend.
It was nice of you to stop by.
That was different.
I've lived in Kobe before.
I need to go feed the chickens.
Don't open the window.
He took a walk before breakfast.
Do you want to tell me what happened?
He came at me with a knife in his hand.
Do you want this shirt?
I spent the whole day in the library.
I had an accident at work.
That book is of no use.
Tom knows what Mary is thinking.
Tom passed out.
An atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.
"In the future, you have to get here on time."
We had a little water.
I owe my success to him.
I was completely devastated.
I've eaten all the crackers.
There are a number of movie theaters in this city.
He gave three wrong answers.
His stupid answer surprised everybody.
Tom isn't creepy.
It seems that they're bored of married life.
Laws differ from state to state in the United States.
There can be no doubt whatever about it.
Tom doesn't have a home.
We'd like that.
Tom is riding a bicycle.
A strange thing happened last night.
Tom is a little younger than your daughter.
Why are you so popular?
She made him rich.
Do you want to dance with me?
The university bears the name of its founder.
"Are you going to tell Tom to leave, or should I?"
"You can't buy it under 1,000 yen."
It would be good if you were to wear summer clothes.
I thought you trusted me.
I go to school by bus.
The apple is not quite ripe yet.
Tom ditched Mary in the park.
You could never do that.
The sky is blue.
He had to leave for Tokyo on short notice.
I have a friend in England.
Tom still doesn't live in Boston.
We're very excited.
Tom realized that it would be better if he left right away.
I bought the book for ten dollars.
I'll try to follow your advice.
He saw a butterfly on the wall.
"If you could do it, would you do it?"
"This isn't an unappealing proposition, is it?"
Do you know anybody in Boston?
I met her again.
He wanted to be rich.
There's the rub.
We must help Tom.
He's good at what he does.
There's a first time for everything.
Tom said that he couldn't breathe.
This is the first time I've ever disagreed with Tom.
It looks like a UFO.
Tom isn't in Boston.
Don't touch these.
It's Tom's profile.
I'm waiting for Tom.
Tom ran past Mary.
Did you murder Tom?
We all agreed to meet here again next Monday.
"All hands, abandon ship!"
Stand up when your name is called.
I don't want to see your face ever again.
There was a brief break in the discussion.
Has your father arrived yet?
It seems so to me that this is not entirely wrong.
Please don't sit on that bench.
"If you can't do it, I'll find someone who can."
Here's the address.
Please write what you said.
You still have a lot to learn.
France and Britain were at war once again.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
Tom volunteered.
Don't open your book.
You can't pick who you fall for.
This is something I'm very proud of.
How old were you when the war broke out?
She got on her bike and rode away.
I believe this is the only thing I can do for you.
Mary took the cookies out of the oven.
Tom doesn't live here in Boston.
The train doesn't stop at that station.
I don't have any Canadian friends.
I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds.
I played tennis after school.
Watch what you're doing.
Please wait here.
Let's meet in front of the main gate at 2:30.
Can't you see what's happening here?
I have it at home.
Tom speaks French better than I do.
Is money important to you?
I can't come up with a good idea.
They hid in the cellar.
She knew the story already.
That was really fun.
We might have misunderstood her.
Come and see me whenever it is convenient for you.
Japanese people are considered to be polite.
"I'm sorry, my mother's not at home."
Why don't you go talk to him?
We go there often.
Who's your favorite singer-songwriter?
I'm running out of time.
Tom and Mary looked at each other for a long time.
The poor girl went out of her mind.
Tom asked if there was anything he could do.
Do you want to leave?
They're smiling at each other.
"The people crowded round the injured man, but they made way for the doctor when he reached the scene of the accident."
I often hear her play the piano.
Mary wore a pink blouse.
I got a fish bone stuck in my throat.
Don't let Tom go outside today.
Do you get your boss a Christmas gift?
Just apologize.
Tom didn't know where Mary lived.
He is suffering from loss of memory.
I wish I were there.
Is that a promise?
It doesn't hurt so much.
Did you get that ticket from Tom?
Who asked you?
Just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
I have my supper at a quarter past seven.
Do you want another one of these?
Why don't you give it another try?
What's your favorite type of pizza?
She does nothing but cry.
She deliberately ignored me on the street.
I got a flat tire.
Please don't tell anybody.
I am studying hard so that I can pass the exam.
Do you like the poem I wrote for you?
My favorite TV show's been canceled.
Tom wants to show you something.
The people protested against the low altitude flight training.
The dog started barking.
Do you understand what he's saying?
You're not as old as I thought you were.
Tom almost pushed the wrong button.
She's just acting disappointed.
Come over and help out.
I'm the only one in this group who doesn't speak French.
That crime is punishable by death.
I want to go home.
I was mortified.
I've forgotten Tom completely.
My brothers and I all share a room.
Today was a beautiful day.
I know I probably won't win.
That was hilarious.
When did I do that?
I don't think it'll rain this afternoon.
Tom doesn't feel like studying.
She looks very happy.
Please proceed.
It almost happened.
One of the disadvantages of living alone is that you have no one to talk to.
I should've just given Tom what he wanted.
She and I are Brazilian.
I didn't know you were that kind of a person.
It is fun to play baseball.
Why don't you have some wine?
Tom borrowed my bike.
They're not looking.
We could get caught.
Tom has trouble judging distances.
You cook better than I do.
That's where you're wrong.
My mom told me that I was fat.
I said everything I had to say.
Do you understand what I mean by that?
I'm not worried about losing my job.
That's a very good suggestion.
I didn't have anything else to do so I thought I'd make myself useful.
You don't need to keep anything.
Tom blacked out.
What will become of us if a war breaks out?
Tom is bragging about his new car.
I'm very surprised to see you here.
Spring follows winter.
I know you like Tom.
There's no reason for you to apologize.
He was silent all the time.
This is something Tom made for you.
You're taking this way too seriously.
Is he married or single?
Tom glanced around the bedroom.
Where can I buy it?
Tom told Mary that he was busy.
She didn't like him.
I live in Yokohama.
Please hurry! Tom is waiting.
Are you sure Tom's going to be there?
I only meant it as a joke.
Did you know my father?
Tom wears a tie to work.
Many tons of waste go into the landfill each month.
There's not enough coffee.
Tom put on his swimsuit.
I wasn't sure which way I should go.
That's what I want most.
She succeeded in opening the box.
Tom has an uncle who is a banker.
It struck like a bombshell!
You're decisive.
I have something else I need to give you.
This was a tough decision.
It looks like you're in a good mood.
Listen to this.
What shall I do with it?
I went to sleep.
Tom called me today.
Tom knew that what he did was wrong.
Everything is in place now.
His parents approve of the engagement.
We want it back.
The president said he would not run for the second term.
I assume you know about Tom's problem.
The president appointed a new manager.
We didn't anticipate their buying a new car.
I forgot to call him today.
I'm writing a song in French.
A pencil is sticking out of your pocket.
Do you have any news?
They are riding very fast.
Tom doesn't do that on Mondays.
I only have six months to live.
Tom didn't want Mary to leave.
I saw Tom hit Mary.
Can you solve the puzzle?
Are you free this weekend?
I will have him repair this watch.
Today is the 20th of October.
His popularity is falling.
Tell Tom to relax.
There was blood everywhere.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I wonder why Tom didn't recognize you.
I need to talk with you about Tom.
Tom didn't mean to do that.
Tom chose wisely.
What have you done with the books?
Call me at this number.
He decided to become an author.
I erased my hard disk by accident.
Is he kind to you?
Maybe Tom is lying.
The post office is that brown building.
"In my opinion, he is correct."
"May I use your car, Dad?"
Your answer is wrong.
I was admiring his new car.
Tell Tom that Mary wants to see him.
We must warn him.
You should see a therapist.
Tom is a baby.
"Not knowing what answer to make, I kept silent."
What made you think of that?
Congratulations!
She and I are Brazilian.
I'll go ask Tom.
Thank you very much for your help.
All the boys ran away.
You don't need to answer that question.
What kind of person would do such a thing?
Tom left at 2:30.
Have you ever heard someone speaking French?
"You had a good time, didn't you?"
President Arthur wanted to reduce the tariffs.
Tom wasn't done.
Tom and Mary are with me.
This is no longer funny.
I like to watch TV.
Do you like music?
You're very good-looking.
Look into the matter more carefully.
There seem to be several reasons for that.
Tom and Mary went for a walk even though it was raining.
I'll always remember you.
Tom can't answer.
Driving during a storm can be dangerous.
Mary felt like Tom was undressing her with his eyes.
This is big.
You can't do anything right now.
I love the smell of your hair.
You have to eat regularly.

The nail tore his jacket.
The murderer hid in the mountains.
"Wherever you go, you see a lot of bicycles left on sidewalks near stations."
I can't give up without a fight.
You haven't seen the last of me.
Penguins often huddle together to keep warm.
What do I need?
It's your civic duty to vote.
You must not get off the train before it stops.
I can't give Tom everything he wants.
I've always wanted to do this.
"There's a cure for everything, except death."
All four of the boys didn't have alibis.
I've finally got used to urban life.
You have an e-mail message in your inbox.
It was not until a few days later that we heard the sad news.
That's not what you said.
Are you alone now?
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
I want to ask them when their wedding day is.
The person who's helping Tom is Mary.
He just wants to impress us with his macho attitude and show us what a great guy he is.
Tom was charged with drunken driving after he was involved in a car accident in Boston.
There's someone in the basement.
Tom pointed his gun at Mary.
I like to study English.
We have broken off relations with them.
Are you finished with the paper?
He ran too fast for me to keep up with him.
It's raining everywhere.
She didn't like him at first.
Now we're in trouble.
Tom was busy.
They are trying to keep costs down.
Tom stopped talking when Mary walked into the room.
Please don't vote for Tom.
Tom doesn't know what's going on.
We can't just walk away.
I am not feeling quite up to par.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
We couldn't have done this without your help.
There are no clean plates.
The president of the university is likely to resign.
Novels aren't being read as much as they used to be.
It doesn't necessarily mean that you're right.
I was going 120 kilometers an hour when the police stopped me.
Why would I say anything?
I made Tom go home.
Tom likes soccer.
I wonder when the rainy season will end.
I ate lunch in a hurry.
Give me the spoon.
Calm down.
That kid's a chip off the old block.
Did Tom give a reason why he was going to be late?
I don't know where to go.
Tom enjoyed the time he spent in Boston with Mary.
Tom regrets his mistake.
Tom was wounded.
They accomplished their mission.
No one wants to go there.
I am visiting my friends.
Tom is kidding.
What are you boys doing out here?
Paper catches fire easily.
I'd be happy if you'd come.
I'm not going to fire you.
Today is Saturday and tomorrow is Sunday.
I want to spend more time with my family.
Tom jotted something in his notebook.
Tom and Mary looked at each other and shrugged.
The kids will love this video.
Thank you for remembering my birthday.
What are we supposed to do with it?
All swans are white.
I opened the box and looked inside.
I don't want to fight with you.
I have no idea where to go.
Tom didn't stop talking.
My uncle lives in London.
They want to take part in the Olympic Games.
Tom and Mary wanted to get married and have kids as soon as possible.
Tom was embarrassed when his parrot came out with a string of obscenities in front of Mary's mother.
Everybody has secrets.
Do your children speak French?
"If Tom had more time, he'd do that."
Why aren't you with the others?
Tom will be here in half an hour.
I sat next to Tom.
I'm not saying what she did was the right thing to do.
It's a relief.
Do you need a lift?
Tom offered Mary a handkerchief.
Tom is a very amazing person.
The children went to school in spite of the rain.
I want Tom out of my house.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom glanced at his watch.
Are we going home?
Choose the lesser of two evils.
Let's discuss the matter here.
I'd like a word with you.
This data is of no value now.
I need a tissue now.
Tom has a lot of original ideas.
He studied abroad.
I'm looking for work.
He explained how to make a fire.
Somebody made a mistake.
I should've been ready.
I am watching wild birds.
What time do you eat dinner?
Tom is a good employee. He gets things done quickly and efficiently.
You were both drunk.
I'm sure Tom will love it.
"I don't care if the early bird gets the worm, I want to sleep."
We know Tom is here.
I want to eat something sweet.
No one's judging you.
I saw that movie three years ago.
Tom can't handle this alone.
Do you have guests for dinner?
It's not hard to find.
You don't have to say a word.
Tom doesn't smoke.
Don't touch anything without asking.
He has transmitted all his knowledge to his son.
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can.
We stayed overnight in Hakone.
Do you resent my being here?
Everyone is singing.
You have to help me.
The audience clapped when the concert was over.
They arrested Tom.
The teacher was disappointed at my answer.
Why are you speaking so loudly?
Tom got on the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor.
I could not understand anything he said.
I'm going to Boston for a conference.
This is the house where I was born.
Tom made fun of my accent.
This knife doesn't cut well.
I have a friend whose father is a famous pianist.
"If you're going to doubt everything, at least doubt your doubt."
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
We've done nothing.
I'm struggling with French grammar.
I've got nothing in my fridge.
I've spent my whole life trying to help others.
The car stereo doesn't work.
We're unhappy.
Tom is a corrections officer.
It's what you deserve.

I bathe once a day.

The plane flew over Mt. Fuji.
"She wants to buy a car, but she can't afford to."
Behave yourself.
Tom talks in his sleep.
That's the main gate.
Tom taught me how to make a campfire.
Don't let that man dominate you.
I'm not thinking about it.
What's the difference between liking and loving someone?
He has been sick in bed all week.
How much do you like Tom?
I can't stand all this noise.
Tom was humiliated.
Please take me to the airport.
Tom knows the situation better than I do.
I can teach you how to dance.
They got along very well.
I have no one to blame but myself.
He couldn't stop smiling.
I've already told Tom all I know.
Did you watch this movie?
Let's watch something else.
It's fun to play baseball.
It's not gold.
I want the best.
I'll go to the park.
I have to go back to work.
"She told him a joke, but he didn't think it was funny."
Are you injured?
Stop wasting time and get back to work.
Which train are you going to take?
There's a warrant out for your arrest.
Tom looked around the empty room.
It'll take some time.
I would like to see it.
I didn't want Tom to leave.
They destroyed stores and factories.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
Tom has been out of work for over a month.
Tom says he has no regrets.
That's the man who lives next door.
The dog chased the cat up a tree.

Mary was an extraordinary woman.
Tom is only happy when he's with Mary.
Do you understand what's going on?
Tom can't believe Mary is serious.
Where do you think the path leads?
You're the one causing all the trouble.
"In my opinion, he's right."
Every person has a psychological need to feel that what he does is of some importance.
Will you help me for a minute?
Tom made me promise not to tell Mary his phone number.
Tom is in the mess hall.
He often helps others.
You should probably tell Tom you don't want to do that.
You won't find anything here.
He's self-employed.
It gradually dawned on me that I had misunderstood him.
How was Tom murdered?
Have you been in Boston long?
I no longer like you.
I wish I could be there with you.
My grandfather will have read the Bible ten times if he reads it again.
I'm afraid you're right.
We play football every Saturday.
I don't have any money and I don't have any friends either.
I wonder what Tom will order for dinner.
I got this bicycle for free.
Please don't use my name.
Please call your first witness.
It's unbelievable.
He was determined to go abroad.
That song always reminds me of my childhood.

Thailand is in Asia.
I'm going to bed now.
How was the game?
He went up the steps slowly.
"Tom blew Mary a kiss, got into his car and drove away."
Tom rolled up his pant legs so they wouldn't get wet.
Perhaps we should take a short break.
We still have a couple of big decisions to make.
Today's my daughter's birthday.
What was Tom doing in Australia last month?
I just sat there trying not to think about how alone I felt.
I'm eighteen.
I wouldn't ask Tom to do anything that he doesn't really want to do.
You can't back out.
"Which are you better at, boogie-boarding or surfing?"
Tom sat with Mary.
He used to be a quiet man.
Let's begin.
Tom sneaked into the room.
Is there anything else you want to know?
I'm a good person.
You can sit down if you like.
The suspect was told not to leave town.
This has been happening quite a lot lately.
You are too young to travel alone.
Tom may do whatever he likes.
Who actually performed the surgery?
Just do your best.
Why pay when you can get it for free?
His greatest fault is talking too much.
"If you try very hard, you will succeed."
Tom feels the same way as I do.
Don't insult me.
You don't have to say anything you don't want to say.

Are you afraid of Tom?
The economy is bad.
He finished the beer and ordered another.
Tom said that he thought that it wouldn't be possible to do that.
I'm counting on it.
Don't worry. I won't hurt her.
It never hurts to tell a story twice.
He still loves her.
Is it necessary for me to explain the reason to him?
We don't know how to use it.
I just wanted to see what it was like.
I didn't expect this question.
It's exactly as I expected.
Tom is probably going to be making more money than me this year.
I don't like that part of town.
I agreed with her.
What is your idea of a good time?
Tom has probably already forgotten about you.
Tom quit.
Tom was disgusted.
Tom frightens me.
Tom wants me to do it.

I never want to see you get in trouble.
You're joking!
It is up to us to help those people.
I do not want to reply to his letter.
Why did you help me?
Tom attended the meeting.
She looked after the children.
Good morning. It's time to wake up.
What a rude man!
Tom disagreed with Mary on that point.
You're too late.
It's a very difficult question for me.
The baby began to crawl.
You don't even know who sent this to you.
I'll make this very brief.
You look content.
I'll help you after work if I'm not too tired.
Have you ever visited Kyoto?
Thanks for having me.

Our town has excellent sports facilities.
You're wanted on the phone. It's from Tom.
We'll visit you tomorrow.
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
This box is so large that it cannot go into my bag.
Tom is the kind of person who always has to have the last word.
I'd rather walk than take a bus.
He believes every word I say.
She is always trying new things.
"If you want your money back, just say so."
I went to school on foot in those days.
"Tom is still engaged to Mary, isn't he?"
They feel hungry.
The mountains are reflected in the lake.
That's what I'm talking about.
I wonder why Tom came here today.
I got the book back from him.
Tom said something in French that I couldn't understand.
Do you mind if I ask why?
Tom felt uncomfortable.
There is a good chance that he will win.
This is highly inefficient.
Come get me.
Can I have this film developed?
Tom turned pale.
Tom and Mary just don't hit it off.
They're looking for Tom.

Cut it in half.
Tom was motivated.
She's innocent.
Go away!
My brother is engaged in cancer research.
I can't deal with this now.
It won't come to that.
Here they come.
I beg to differ.

Tom told me this would only take three hours.
Many people like to travel.
Tom waved goodbye to Mary.
I'd really like to go swimming this afternoon.
Tom is planning to eat dinner with Mary tonight.
She doesn't want to play with her toys.
I like trains.
Do what you think is right.
He likes to swim.
My uncle died of cancer two years ago.
He is good at golf.
Pardon me for saying so.
He got up at eight in the morning.
Tom likes the idea.
Tom wants Mary to know that he likes her.
Both claims are false.
I won't rest until I find out the truth.
Men are idiots.
Lawyers are all liars.
He took back everything he said.
"He is not fond of sports, and I am not either."
I don't think anyone else could do my job.
I hear you were in Boston recently.
The baby is crawling now.
Don't forget to take an umbrella in case it rains.
"We could all see it coming, couldn't we?"
He is not wearing a hat.
I'll be taking Tom's place.
Tom very rarely speaks French.
Do you agree?
"Sorry, I can't help."
You cannot achieve anything without effort.
I'm surprised you overlooked it.
You're speaking a little too fast for me. Would you speak a little more slowly?
I ran as fast as possible to catch up with him.
Fill the bottle with water.
I'm free today.
Tom lives all by himself.
You have to come home.
Have you ever traveled in a plane?

Come back soon.

You frightened Tom.
"Tom's party was kind of fun, actually."
Do you believe that women have a sixth sense?
I have been living here for three years.
I bet you didn't expect to see me again so soon.
Tom has difficulty making decisions.
You look like you've just lost your best friend.
How do you like my new hairstyle?
Tom appreciates everything that Mary has done for him.
Would you please turn off the TV?
I think Tom is mistaken.
Isn't there something you want to say to Tom?
Your work didn't come up to our expectations.
We disputed for hours about what to write.
Tom is exactly like his father.
Tom told me he hadn't done that yet.
When did you begin learning English?
We cannot do without salt even for a single day.

"Tom promised he'd be there, but he never showed up."
Tom isn't happy to be here.
I don't like goodbyes.
"If it is fine tomorrow, we will play baseball."
I asked Tom where he got that.
I must find work.

I'd come here again.
Can I get some clean towels?

I don't mind walking in the rain.
I want my mommy.
What are you doing today?
Tom may be hot.
Tom showed me how to use his camera.
How far is it to the library from here?
Are you free this afternoon?
Who'd hurt Tom?
Did Tom go?
We have to start at once.
Tom comes to Boston once or twice a year.
I was very worried about her.
Why don't you return to your quarters?
She saved money for a rainy day.
The tall man came out of the house.
I took my temperature every six hours.
The plan has failed.
She gave me these old coins.
Stir the soup.
That actually happened.
Do you like Mozart?
How did you get into the tunnel?

I can stay in the car while you go into the bank.

Don't you think it's time for you to settle down?
Whose shirt is this?
I don't know if Tom still lives in Boston.
My turn comes next.
Tom thought about what Mary had said.
This weighed heavily on my mind.
What a wonderful invention!

I want to rent this room to a student.
"I speak French, too."
We have left undone what we ought to have done.
We haven't been able to find out where Tom got his degree.
Would you please take off your shoes?

Is this your money?
Do you have less expensive ones?
He's rich rather than poor.

He told me just the opposite!
You were so good at tennis. Why did you give it up?

No one listened to me.
Why are you always the one deciding everything for us?
Let's do the exact opposite.

I asked Tom to join us.
Don't forget to flush the toilet.
Tom would've liked what you said.
We have to leave now if we want to get home before dark.

Let's get off the bus.
I don't know how I can help you.
This car is his.
My daughter is fast asleep.
He asked me to do it.
He soon accustomed himself to cold weather.
Tell everybody.
She spent her life in pursuit of the truth.
Can you tell us a bit more about that?
Tom is almost as tall as I am.
You never come over anymore.
I'd like to find a way to improve my memory.
I'm right beside you.
It's way too heavy.
Please give me a pencil and some sheets of paper.
You must admit that you are in the wrong.
You have to face the facts.
Thank you for adding me to your contacts.
Don't talk rubbish.
Why are you drinking water?
I was really depressed.
Don't worry about the results.
I heard a woman scream.
"If you want to stay here, you are welcome to."
This is ugly.
She rented a four-room apartment.
How can I ever repay you?

That's why I don't like you.
Tom hides his savings inside a shoebox.
"In my opinion, French is a hard language to learn."
We'll be back after the break.
"Since the sun had set, we all headed home."
There's no need to rush things.
Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary needed to do that.
He is afraid of death.
What if someone finds out?
Tom asked Mary if she'd like a cup of coffee.
I've been doing that since about 2:30.
I finally was able to contact Tom.
You took some unnecessary risks.
How did you end up in Boston?
He is getting better.
I will show you around the city.
I have a granddaughter about your age.
Tom is going to be happy here.
We should come here more often.

I didn't intend to say that.
Tom has a learning disability.
Tom gave Mary a kiss on the forehead.
That's highly unlikely.
"You're not happy, are you?"
"I think you're a great guy, but I don't have any romantic feelings for you."
What happens if I press this button?
He stood in front of me.
Carry this for me.
Did you speak to Tom yesterday?

I'm wealthy.
You're all racists.
She poured brandy into the glasses.
Let go of the bottle.
I'd like to take my jacket off.
That's not how I see it.
Tom has decided not to tell Mary about what happened.
I'm going to see Tom.
How did Tom take the news?
Tom is a bit of a nitpicker.

He may come today.
Do you know Tom's secret?
It's never that simple.
Tom bakes bread once a week.

The problem is as good as settled.

Tom came along at just the right time.
Why is it there?
I was in Boston almost all summer.
What's the purpose of your visit?
"Tom wanted to get married, but Mary didn't."
How far is it from your house to town?
Is she single or married?
I don't know the reason why she isn't coming.
Men know nothing about women.
This house is very spacious.
Tom said he wanted to improve his French.
It's about time we went back.
Would it bother you if I smoke?
Tom hasn't played tennis for a while.
Tom says that someday he'll do that.
Why did you agree to help them?
Older people are often afraid of trying new things.
There could be no doubt as to who the man was.
Fur coats are on sale.
It was a very cold winter.
"Objection! ""Sustained!"""
She asked him to give her some money so she could go to a restaurant with her friends.
Why aren't you wearing any clothes?

I just can't do it.
Don't leave them alone.
Progress is unavoidable.
"Tom didn't know the meaning of ""anglophobia,"" so he did a quick web search to see if he could find out what it meant."
"Your name wouldn't be Tom, would it?"
The tree grew very tall.
I want you to start taking things seriously.
Roses are my favorite flowers.
I know that Tom is from Boston.
You said it yourself.
This one has a lot of advantages over that one.
The birth rate and death rate were nearly equal.
What time do you go home?
I have a reservation for six-thirty.
No one ever doubted that Tom would win.
You saved us all.
Tom barely speaks to us anymore.
There it is!
Tom is on the roof.
You will be able to see him tomorrow.
I want my key back.
I'm trying to lose weight.
Tom sits at his computer eight hours a day.
I've got nothing.

I don't know what Tom saw.
You took advantage of me.
What a big pumpkin!
"While we were discussing the problem, I hit upon a good idea."
Are you tired?
I'm in the habit of sleeping late on Sundays.
"They're late, as usual."
This morning I got up earlier than usual.
My father made me what I am.
You remind me of Tom.
I'm not here because of that.
It frosted last night.
The parrot is dead.
This town is really dead at night.
That's only the tip of the iceberg.
Please stop talking. I need to concentrate on my game.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
Nobody had any idea what I wanted.
"Tom loves Mary, but she doesn't love him."
I have a credit card.
This piece of furniture has a fine finish.
Are we done?

"If you see her from a distance, she is beautiful."
You're too good for Tom.
His death was a great loss to our country.
There's no shortage of work.
We have not received a letter from him so far.
Tom came in.
Which subject do you like best?
Tom isn't going to be able to work tomorrow.
She put on her sister's jeans and looked in the mirror.
I was in prison for three years.
It is obvious that that is a lie.
I want to talk to you for a minute about Tom.
The mere sight of a dog frightens him.
Don't let him switch off the light.
We could give it a try.
He doesn't have a family.
You have to leave Boston.
I pretended I didn't know how to open the safe.
He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.
This is the last game.
What did you have for supper last night?

Tom was yelling.
I had to work on Sunday.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.

She wouldn't harm a fly.
Why don't we take a look?
She has been to Hawaii several times.
Don't be so angry.
I think we should just be friends.
Tom filled the empty glass with ice.
We celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary yesterday.
Our team is winning.
She sat next to him on the bus.
Tom found my contact lens.
"Suddenly, I blacked out."
What we need now is a little peace and quiet.
I didn't eat everything that she served me.
Tell Tom he has to do that today.
You learn a lot about your own country if you live abroad.
A fire broke out during that night.
She took him to the lake.
What results do you anticipate?
I know how much you care about Tom.
I love what I'm doing here.
This lake supplies our city with water.
It's very good.
Does Coca-Cola have caffeine in it?

I have a message for you from her.
I've been very busy since the new term started.
He whispered something to me.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
Getting started is always difficult.
Tom's rent is three hundred dollars a month.
Tom left quietly.
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
You look terrible.
Is that Tom's umbrella?
I made use of every opportunity to improve my English.
It's pretty disappointing.
Tom couldn't keep lying to Mary. He felt he just had to tell her the truth.
How is it possible?
I can't be something I'm not.
I'll meet you there in an hour.
It's windy.
What about your wife?
Are you taking your meds?
He wasn't there last week.
Tom can't make his own decisions.
She was fortunate to pass the exam.
What time is your curfew?
Tom shared the food that his mother had given him with his friends.
I can fly.
Every country has its national flag.

A monster was believed to live in the cave.
Who stopped?
I was delayed by a traffic jam.

He gave up.
This isn't money.
She will never talk about it.
Please move this stone from here to there.
Are they American?
I thought you'd like it.
"What were you just doing? ""I was talking to Tom."""
He's a weak-willed man.
Fancy seeing you here.
I'm going to wait outside.
Come back in.
What would you suggest that I get Tom for his birthday?
Give it a rest.
I don't like other people touching my things.
I have a friend in Spain who speaks five languages.
Do you like to dance?
Tom plays the piano very well.
"When he spoke, everyone became silent."
I want to talk to you about last night.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might need to do that today.
Yesterday was Thursday.
I can't remember ever being so scared.
Tom trusts me.
"You don't want to make Tom mad, do you?"
"I can't read French, nor can I speak it."
He hates spiders.
That didn't work.
He is too cautious to try anything new.
I gave it to the little boy.
Did Tom win again?
Why are you so busy all the time?
I already told you everything I know.
I hope you'll get his support.
I have lost my key.
I don't feel well. Please give me some medicine.
Why don't you hire Tom to do the job?
I watched them skin a human being that day.
The frog came out of the water.
Always wear sandals in a public shower.
Tom put the videotape in the player.
Too many sweets make you fat.

I want to send Tom a letter.
You should have consulted me first.
Tom hates liars.
I want to apologize for the other day.
She is about as tall as me.
Have you checked our supplies recently?
I don't live in Boston.
I've got too much to do.
Don't worry. I'll be careful.
It has happened before.
I am afraid they both have a bad reputation.
"If I had known about your illness, I could have visited you in the hospital."
Are you sure this is the right train?
Her mother was busy cooking the dinner.
What should I buy?
The story appears to be true.
Beware of the dog!
Tom is now cramming for the finals.
"For more information, please visit our website."
His house is not far from here.
"You don't like gambling, do you?"
Tom lost his job during the last recession.
It was a complete success.
I knew Tom would like it here.
Tom is very materialistic.
Tom is the only one who knows what's going on.
I'll never forget this.
Do you want me to leave the light on?
Tom loves cooking.
I didn't hear you coming.
We must stop Tom before he hurts himself.
"Hey, that was really great."
I've come to save Tom.
I didn't take many pictures on my trip.
She died yesterday afternoon.
Please don't hang up.
It's a Cuban cigar.
I'd like to reserve a seat.
You've set a bad example.
Tom fought bravely.
I love to see you smile.
"Mozart wrote brilliant, complex musical compositions as easily as you or I would write a letter."

Tom isn't going to know.
I tried to keep from crying.
We're not expecting you to help.
Tom walked down the street whistling a happy tune.
When did you find this?
I don't want to live in Boston.
We have a guest.
I talked with our sales people.
We listened to his lecture on the radio.
He had to learn to accept that failures were necessary milestones on the road to success.
Respect yourself.
Switzerland is a beautiful country worth visiting.
One day he killed himself.
Mary is my stepmother.
It takes us a long time to master a foreign language.
Tom pulled the doors shut.
A sane man wouldn't do that.
Tom may have been sick.
Tom will try to stop me for sure.
Tom isn't normal.
He agreed with me.
I anticipate that there will be problems on their expedition.
I think that you ought to apologize to her.
There's not a cloud in the sky.
I was almost right.
The President refused to answer the question.
He has brown hair.
Physics is my favorite subject.
I saw a white dog jump over the fence.
He sent about 2.2 billion spam emails over a period of around one and a half years.

It will take me more than three hours to look over the document.
Please stop singing that song.
Tom paid nothing.
This is a pocket dictionary.
"There is little, if any, hope of his being alive."
She is always free in the afternoon.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.
I am a tourist.
The mechanic repaired the damage without delay.
Tom has lost about thirty pounds.
I don't want to see you here again.
Is your husband at home?
"Tom is short, but not as short as Mary."
It's incredibly beautiful.
You can't just sit here all day.
I have to get back to Boston.
Do you like it in Boston?
I can't help how I look.
We can't just let Tom leave.
Hug me.
"Afterwards, he assumed a new identity."
We can't predict what'll happen.
Tom biked home.
I forgot something in my car.
Where do you want me to put this?
This is pointless.
You have got to be kidding.
Are you going to tell Tom what I did?
That would be nice.
I think I'll take it.
Get out of bed!
I don't play the piano.
Are you able to catch a ball with one hand?
When was the last time you talked with Tom?

What's in those boxes?
My parents live outside the city.
He continued to work.
Tom opened the glove compartment and took out his registration.
Let's hope that we get there on time.
This box contains five apples.
Tom is a nice person.
Let me see your tongue.
"If you are busy, I will help you."
I watch TV almost every evening.
Where's my sister?
"Every year, millions of people die of hunger in Africa."
Tom never got better.
I used to feed my dog twice a day.
My watch says 2:30.
I live in Kazakhstan.
How long have you guys known each other?
Has Tom come?
"I'm sorry, did you say something?"
Thousands of people visited the city.
Now you've hurt my feelings.
There are too many of them.
I can do this alone.
Tom was hurting.
Red is better.
I'll miss you so much.
She made me a star.
Tom won a free trip to Boston.
I'm going to take a quick shower.
Her beauty was beyond description.
Babies cry when they are hungry.
"Excuse me, but do you mind if I ask your name?"

He gave his seat to the old man.
He often travels to foreign countries.
"In the year 2012, there will be flying cars everywhere."
We were just about to vote.
The coach made us run three extra laps.
Tom said he thought Mary was in Boston.
You have some explaining to do.
Give me a hand with this case.
He was killed in an airplane accident.
"Tom likes Mary. ""Tell me something I don't know."""
She takes a taxi from the station to her house.
"Can you break a 10,000 yen bill?"
There is no harm in you sleeping late on Sunday.
All of her songs became hits.
They succeeded.
Tom says he has no idea who Mary is.
Tom is a good violinist.
I saw her crossing the street.
Are the train tickets expensive?
You have one hour to get this done.
I deserve to be treated with respect.
I don't believe anyone anymore.
They had no idea what needed to be done.
The medicine did wonders for his health.
What do you make of that?
Tom married into money.
A blood vessel burst inside his brain.
"Open the door, please."
Both Tom and Mary are young and attractive.
Men never cry.
How long were you there?
It's very alarming.
The jury found the man guilty of murder.

"The situation called for quick, decisive action."
It could happen to anyone.
Tom stepped back.
Where is the restroom?
Do your best and don't worry.
"He said, ""I want to be a scientist."""
It'll soon be dark.
That is the house where I was born.
I'm never going to leave you again.
Tom believes that the rich deserve to be rich and that the poor deserve to be poor.
Is Tom going to do that?
Please remember to come and see us this weekend.
Tom tried to open the car door.
I'll make you breakfast.
That's an even better idea.
The news spread like wildfire.
You are not logged in.
Tom will go to Boston the month after next.
Are you saying Tom isn't happy?
You hardly ate anything.
We've got another three days.
Tom was a war hero.
Tom is back to square one.
Start now.
"It is cold there, even in summer."
We just got started.
Tom didn't want Mary to see him in handcuffs.
He's a man of his word.
I want you to be with me.
I don't have a son named Tom.
We've made a lot of improvements today.
One of your neighbors complained about all the junk in your front yard.
Tom can't read yet.
Tom is particular about what he watches on TV.
I cannot help liking him in spite of his many faults.
He broke my heart.
My muscles have gotten soft.
He won a gold medal.
Tom is too shy to sing in public.
People like Tom.
This doesn't prove anything.
You can visit me tomorrow.
I want something to drink.
Tom is retired.
We were supposed to go swimming together.
Drivers should be aware of the traffic rules.
You've arrived too early.
Tom could hardly believe his eyes.
I'm not a thief.
You've got to see this.
I thought maybe I'd better not clean my room.
I broke that.
I hope it will clear up soon.
I thought Tom and Mary were busy.
The child was paralyzed with fear.
I often go to the beach.
I don't recall asking for your advice.
I called him a coward to his face.
Who makes the decisions here?
Tom took his glasses off and put them in his pocket.
"She hit me, not him."
I did that until I was exhausted.
Could I borrow a pencil?
He tried to commit a suicide.
I never make my bed.
Stop thinking about it.
The young couple was accompanied by a chaperone.
"Thanks to my mother's help, I was able to buy a mountain bike."
Did Tom contact you?
Did it ever occur to you that I might want to stay in Boston for a few more days?
"When the fire broke out, he was fast asleep."
Tom is hard of hearing.
You often find that sympathy turns into love.
I think I remember how to do that.
We don't talk much.
Please tell me where the police station is.
Tom is panting.
"Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy."
You don't have to tell me.
I don't know what happened to him.
Let's call Tom.
Tom knows how to make good use of his time.
Tom mentioned your name.
He reminds me of somebody.
I want you to leave me alone.
Tom spent a lot of time in Boston.
How long have you known him?
Tom is wicked.
I think we made a wrong turn somewhere.
"Tom, there's something I forgot to tell you."
"Tom's constant arguing irritates some of his classmates. However, most of the class has just learned to ignore him."
This road goes to the park.
Tom is devious.
Let's open the wine.
I didn't think you'd remember me.
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
Tom is still sleeping.
The children were swimming naked.
Being a prince is not easy.
Open your eyes.
He could no longer restrain himself.
Tom crumpled up the paper and threw it in the trashcan.
"You're not sleepy, are you?"
What I don't understand is why the children aren't being allowed to play outside on such a nice day.
Tom screwed in the light bulb.
Tom was demanding.
Tom is a talented hockey player.
She was born blind.
It was not until the baby was fed that he stopped crying.
I may be too old.
I think that's undeniable.
Tom left his house before dawn.
I like to see comedy in the theater.
I argued with him about it.
You can't be hungry. You've just had dinner.
I don't like bad children.
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
I'll pay with travelers' checks.
Drunk people are so entertaining.
I was encouraged by his words.
Tom is merciless.

She dumped him.
Don't park here.
We have exams right after summer vacation.
She is living in some village in India.
This book is still copyrighted.
He's still sponging off his father.
We went to the mountain to ski.
I heard the leaves rustling.
This box contains apples.
I feel better today.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
We worry about your future.
Nobody has solved the problem.
I'm game.
I've heard that Tom is planning to move to Boston.
"Why do you want to know? ""I'm just curious."""
We've all done things we wish we hadn't done.
Maybe Tom did the right thing for the wrong reason.
Please wake me up at seven tomorrow morning.
A cold spell gripped Europe.
I'm playing the devil's advocate.
How much can you make washing cars?
I ran.
This is really big.
Employers are not required to give their employees paid sick leave.
What does it matter to us?
I bought a newspaper.

Am I the only one here who doesn't speak French?
You can't have a rainbow without a little rain.
A beam of sunlight came through the clouds.
I just arrived.
He was popular with girls because he was on the football team.
"She is poor, but she is happy."
I wish we'd bought another bottle of wine.
We're overreacting.
He tried to stand up.
I no longer love him.
Is this your car?
Have you seen my son?
This run of good luck won't last forever.
I'm giving you a second chance.
"Give me a second, please."
It takes us thirty minutes to walk from here to the station.
Do you want me to go?
What will you wear?
Doesn't that look fun?
Are you finished with the paper?
"If I had wings, I would fly to you."
Maybe we shouldn't have gotten married.
Tom was stupid.
I know you're talented.
I understand that.
The thief had special tools for picking locks.
I don't really want to bother you with my problems.
"Without your help, I couldn't have done it."
When will you come home?
What are you going to do about that?
I have almost three thousand dollars in my safe.
She makes excellent meals in the blink of an eye.
Your efforts will bear fruit someday.
You might change your mind in a couple of weeks.
"Since you did the cooking, I'll do the dishes."
Tom saw muddy footprints on the floor.
Tom lives in the Bible belt.
Which shoes are you going to put on?
Is there a curfew?

I wanted them to win.
Tom couldn't get to sleep.
Tom and his brother look quite similar.
I wish I was faster.

Beat the egg whites until stiff.
She's asking for the impossible.
Tom hates running.
Tom pulled out some necklaces from his bag and told Mary to choose the one she liked.
I'm just a farmer.
You bet I'm worried.
"At the meeting, we came up with a lot of new ideas."
The cat put its nose in the pot.
You owe me a beer.
I know what people want.
They want you dead.
Tom doesn't know anything about computers.
Tom is more interesting than Mary.
I wasn't hungry anyway.
In my job I have to deal with all kinds of people.
American students are falling behind in math.
There is no time to quarrel over such a thing.
Did you know my father?
"Hey, wait for me."
Look at that dog.
I stopped smoking once and for all.
What are the symptoms?
I went to church with Tom.
Tom won't confess.
I wish you had told me about the accident.
I'm sorry I can't help you.
Does Tom like Mary?
Tom doesn't know about Mary's death yet.
The trip will take approximately five hours.
I would like to tell you something.
"If that guitar were not so expensive, I could buy it."
What should I do if Tom calls?
I know how difficult it is for you to admit that you are wrong.
Tom has three gorgeous daughters.
Tell him where he should go.
I'm not interested in your opinion.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
That work is poorly done.
We have guests.
My dream is to become a famous singer.
Do you follow?
My brother's name is Tom.
Tom doesn't always obey his parents.
Isn't that what really matters?
Don't make promises that you can't keep.
Let's get back to business.
I miss my mom and dad.
I don't want to lose Tom.
I have a black dog named Tiki.
The man confessed that he had robbed the old woman.
The old man lives by himself.
I can no longer stand the cold.
The fire went out.
We have far better things to do with our time.
Have you ever wondered how many stars are in the sky?
I didn't think you even liked me.
What was Tom's response?
The lawyer was expecting him.
Tom is amusing.
The trouble is that we are short of money.
Have you ever taught French to anyone?
You're lucky Tom lent you some money.
He breathed his last.
Give them a couple of minutes.
Tom and Mary went to the beach by bicycle.
Do you have a pen?
Do you think you could help?
Tom doesn't know the details.
I might vote for Tom.
I'm older than your brother.
His friend promised never to abandon him.
"If you will not be available at the new time, please let us know."
He shined his shoes.
I don't want you to lose.
Everyone smiled.
What an embarrassing situation that was!
Tom finished.
Tom approached.
Why don't we sit down and talk about it?
I have a bad pain in my back.
Put everything in my basket.
Tom isn't afraid of death.
I'm going to give it to Tom.
I have already finished reading this book.
Come here.
Tom knew where Mary wanted to live.
Let's follow Tom.
Tom and Mary aren't happy.
She's in danger.
Tom and Mary are looking for you.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
The population of Tokyo is about five times as large as that of our city.
Will the price keep going up?
Tom closed the store.
The fork is dirty.
Go and talk to Tom.
Tom is living with his uncle now.
Tom and Mary got married and settled in Boston.
She telephoned him that she couldn't attend the meeting.
Listen carefully to what I say.
Tom didn't notice that his fly was open.
The sky cleared up soon after the storm.
"Tom wrote Mary a love letter, but he didn't send it."
There's no harm in trying.
She shivered at the sight.
I'd like to cancel my reservation.
She's nice to me.
The sun was hidden by thick clouds.
Tom promised that that'll never happen again.
Trying to correct that boy is useless.
She has a son and two daughters.
Tom is a slob.
I know what I want to do.
Tom knows what Mary likes.
Don't laugh at him.
"Where are you from, Tom?"
Tom finally contacted Mary by phone.
Tom said he needed more money.
I hope you like what I've just given you.
It's Monday.
I came here yesterday.
It is easy to add 5 to 10.
They waited in line for the bus.
I heard that he'd died.
Tom and Mary aren't always right.
Let's go out to eat.
She was wearing a black hat.
He isn't afraid of death.
There's been an accident.
You've taught us a great deal.
This boat is no longer seaworthy.
Tom asked me to talk to Mary.
All Tom needs is a little love and affection.
"By the way, my English is absolutely hopeless."
I'm not interested in any of your theories.
Tom looks haggard.
Tom was frightened and didn't want to be left alone.
Elephants are in danger of dying out.
Tom left five minutes early.
Isn't that why we're here?
That's not why I came here.
That war ended in 1954.
I've been working here for many years.
You can smoke here.
Could you hang up the laundry?
Have you ever been fingerprinted?
Tom believes it's absolutely necessary to drink at least a liter of water every day.
"Mary doesn't dance much now, but I know she used to a lot."
I want to try snowboarding.
"Tom isn't Mary's father, but her uncle."
"Action speaks louder than words, but not nearly as often."
I never thought it'd be this hard to build a picnic table.
It interested me.
I'd do almost anything for you.
I'm hoping that doesn't happen.
Your reputation is good.
Tom wanted to do something nice for Mary.
Tom is still looking for Mary.
Tom will be furious.
Give me the green book.
How did you break your leg?
Any book will do.
I don't like music as much as you do.
I'm moving as fast as I can.
Did you clean your room?
"Tom is young. ""How young is young?"" ""He's thirteen."""
Everything went well with him.
He envies all his friends.
Tom is three years younger than Mary is.
Tom doesn't care what people think about him.
They wouldn't let anyone talk to me.
His behavior is sometimes strange.
Tom may be out.
We'll visit you sometime.
Tom took a look at what Mary had written.
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow.
He's active and fit.
Is Tom out?
Once is not enough.
I don't know if today is Tuesday or Wednesday.
I don't think you should tell Tom the truth.
That doesn't help me.
Take your time with it.
He was on the roof with his electric guitar.
Don't be an idiot.
Tom asked me to give this to you.
My brother sends you his regards.
Tom got out of prison on October 20th three years ago.
Tom is scolding Mary.
Tom was in trouble financially.
"In the sight of God, all men are equal."
No one has said a word.
There is only one book on the desk.
I got divorced.
You'll never guess what happened just after you left.
A lot of policemen guarded the hall.
Don't you have any friends?
He will write an answer very soon.
I have just what you need.
I can't live without her.
You haven't seen the last of me.
I just need to find out why.
You can't always have your own way.
Heavy snow prevented the train from departing.
Your lips are blue.
I was just about to leave.
Do you love my brother more than me?
You ought to be ashamed.
I tore up the paper.
A baby deer can stand as soon as it's born.
I need someone to talk with.
We couldn't make out what she wanted.
What was the cause of your quarrel?
Tom will never tell you what really happened.
Tell me that we haven't failed.
It's really cold today.
Does it even matter?
She set the world record for the high jump.
I need to plan my next trip.
Mary put the ham in the oven.
He is capable of keeping a secret when he wants to.
How long is the bridge?
Tom knows what he's looking for.
Did you wait for Tom?
Mary visited her husband in prison.
Don't you want Tom there?
Tom went back to his bedroom.
I should have known they would betray me.
This is the house where he lived.
"Push the button, please."
"If you should meet a bear, pretend to be dead."
You don't have the right.
Tom gave us everything he had.
I wanted Tom to have a copy of my new novel.
Don't spill the beans.
Tom is willing.
We'll take this.
They are proud of their daughter.
Does Tom have a big family?
What was there?
I am very happy.
My son is now as tall as I am.
Tom didn't drive Mary home.
This isn't helping.
Tell me it isn't true.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
What do you think they are?
She behaved with a great courage.
I've been acquitted.
I'm glad you were there.
Were you at school at that time?
Can somebody help me?
Do you keep a diary?
Tom thinks he knows where Mary went.
I love working here.
I'm going to bed early tonight.
I can't remember.
Tom told me a good joke this morning.
We have to start.
He is a mere child.
We must go there whether we like it or not.
I don't know where Tom is.
Are you familiar with the rules of soccer?
Did you understand what he said?
Did you call your friend in Canada?
Tom threw the book into the fire.
Where has she gone?
The word order needs to be changed.
Tom doesn't like to ask for help from people he doesn't know.
Tom is scared to talk to Mary.
Tom left home at 2:30.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Can you do it in one day?
He is absorbed in his work.
I can't help but feel like I've forgotten something.
I quit smoking half a year ago.
Tom was upset.
He zipped up his jacket.
Tom can change.
You can't trust anyone these days.
"To me, she's irreplaceable."
He was one of the leaders of the revolution.
I hate being alone this time of year.
A big spider was spinning a web.
You should give this task to some other person.
I wasn't on time for school this morning.
Tom lives near us.
You look nice with your hair short.
I pretended that I didn't know Tom.
I think Tom looks ridiculous.
I spent 100 dollars today.
It's not going to be easy to decide.
"You ate sushi yesterday, didn't you?"
Why can't people just be nice to each other?
I like to paint with watercolors.
I need more money.
Is your headache gone?
Compare the translation with the original.
She came last.
I'm not crazy.
Tom has already started eating lunch.
I read that book a long time ago.

The plane arrived exactly at nine.
Let's take a 10 minute break.
I have a stuffed-up nose.
I'm really not all that hungry.
Can I talk to you about something?
You need to wear a tie there.
That's not such a terrible idea.
Tom was here with Mary yesterday afternoon.
Are you always busy?
"If he had not worked hard, he would have failed the examination."
He seems to be ill.

Tom is away on a business trip.
She didn't appear to recognize me.
I guess I'm just too stupid to understand what you're trying to say.
Thank you for doing me this favor.
Mary is really great. She cooked a wonderful meal for me and even washed the dishes herself.
Tell me which one to choose.
Tom thought Mary's dress wasn't appropriate for the occasion.
Tom had never seen a girl as beautiful as Mary before.
Didn't you read the sign?
The light is on in Tom's room.
He went out of the room.
How about going for a walk after lunch?

I think Tom is going to like it here.
Health is worth more than gold.
Tom kept the truth from us.
He didn't get the joke.
Tom and Mary were both surprised.
Why don't we go somewhere private?
I have a large family.
I don't know why we let you do that.
We'll never get there in time.
Her speech was excellent.
Staying up late at night is very bad for your skin.
That's better than nothing.
Tom didn't realize he had his sweater on inside out.
"We suffered a loss of 10,000 dollars."
I can't get back to sleep.
Let's pool all our money.
I don't think Tom is selfish.
I don't hate anyone.
That was serious.
We don't know whether to believe Tom or not.
I cannot cook as well as my mother does.
Don't you see what that means?
We can definitely find a cab to take us to the station.

Here she is!
I go to work by car every day.

Your secret will be safe with me.
She wouldn't hurt a fly.
She has a long nose.
I found it something of a disappointment.
It is impossible to resolve the conflict.
"Who is it? ""It's me."""
Can you speak any Native American language?

He painted the ceiling blue.
You're so weird.
Tom doesn't listen to me.
"If possible, I'd like to see him."
That's more than I can handle alone.
Tom said he was going to kill Mary.
Tom lost again.
The fish he caught yesterday is still alive.
I don't think that I'll get there on time.
What time did you close the store last night?
Tom went home by taxi.
We were all worried.
She married him for his money.
If you need an umbrella I'll lend you one.
I can't lift this. It's too heavy.

Keeping up with the Joneses is expensive in rich town like Beverly Hills.
This is the camera he took the picture with.
Tom apologized and then hung up.
Your answer is correct.
What's your real purpose?
Tom was there with one of his friends.
"You don't know my dad, do you?"
Drop your weapons!
This is never going to work.

The bus stopped.
What's their plan?
He lived in Kyoto in his college days.
Things were never the same after that.
You can't imagine how busy I was.

What's his name again?
Tom sure talks big.
A war broke out between the two countries.
I'll cook you whatever you want.
"I'm sorry, but I have to go."
"If Tom doesn't eat this, please give it to Mary."
This old building has seen better days.
She stole my clothes!
I cannot afford to buy such a thing.
We played on the beach.
I think that's a good idea.
Did he go to see Mary?
This is a great facility.
Tom knows some words in French.
Here's a piece of paper.
I'm not very hungry.
I was hoping to find you here.
Tom is rich enough to do just about anything he wants to do.
Tom gave me a key.
I don't know what's taking Tom so long.
I don't want to go away.
I would like to go to the concert with you.
What he did is not wrong.
Our class has 41 students.
Do you have a book written in English?
Tom is the one who told me where you live.
I'll show you around town.
Is there any food you don't like?

You are good.
Stars can be seen at night.

Is that what you want to do?
How did he come here?
"If I happen to end up going abroad, I'd probably go for France."
There was hardly anyone in the room.
We aren't kids anymore.
"This time, it's different."
Tom got married.
It's no secret.
It was careless of him to make such a mistake.
I must convince Tom to come.
We try to go to Boston at least once a year.
None of his students could solve the problem.
"I listened, but I didn't hear anything."
Thanks a lot for all the things you've done for me.
He wrote a book about his adventures in the jungle.
"Tom really scared you, didn't he?"
Mary broke up with her boyfriend.
Is Tom stupid?
What happened to my suitcase?
I knew there was something familiar about him.
He wondered why she did that.
How high can you jump?
Tom's story had a happy ending.
I love him despite his faults.
"No matter what you say, I am convinced that I am right."
I hope that nobody saw you coming in here.
Let's get ready for school.
How old is your refrigerator?
I'm proud to be Canadian.
Who's your favorite artist?
Today's the big day.
I went there out of curiosity.
I try to avoid going into the woods after dark.
Football is more popular than tennis.
"Tom got his learner's permit yesterday, so he's out with his father practicing driving."
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom to help?
I'll bet you can't guess what happened to me today.
I don't want to torment you any longer.
They were stuck in the elevator for two hours.
She helped her younger brother finish his picture.
We were just about to start eating.
I bribed the policeman.
You should not talk here.
Tom is one of the most respected men in the business world.
Didn't it occur to you to shut the windows?
Tom prepared for the worst.
His illness resulted from drinking too much.
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying.
How well do you know Tom?
We no longer need you.
The patient has no pulse.
A stewardess was rescued from the wreck.
The nurse removed Tom's bandages.
That's why I told you not to go alone.
You must respect your elders.
He was too tired to go any further.
Tom sat on the bench next to Mary.
It's not a competition.
A man of wealth has to pay a lot of income tax.
It scares me.
I'm buying fruit and chocolate.
Tom moves really well.
"I borrowed 1,000 yen from my cousin."
I'd like you to handle it.
God created man in his own image.
He has no close friends to talk with.
You'd better let me do that for you.
Where is my red pen?
I have lived in Kobe since last year.
I think that everyone has to make efforts to save nature.
I caught a bad cold last week.
How do you like Texas so far?
She risked her life to save him.
She was allowed to go to the disco on condition that she was back by ten.
What do you want to say?
Tom is standing in the corner of the room.
Don't ask me to do this.
What time is it?
Please get all of your junk out of this room.
No problem.
What did I miss?
This key won't go in the lock.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
Tom is behind this.
Where will she put them?
I just guessed.
Tom is good at what he does.
I would've shown you how to do it right.
It is important for me.
Tom is annoying.
"If you get your right ear pierced, that means you're gay."
"Don't just stand there, say something."
Is there a mailbox near here?
Are you still friends with them?
Tom is a gentleman.
Translate the underlined sentences.
"If Tom doesn't go, I won't either."
I have a plan. Don't worry.
She speaks Chinese.
May I go with Tom?
My sister always keeps her room clean.
I need to talk to you about what's going to happen tomorrow.
Tom wondered how many minutes it would take him to run to the bus stop.
Have you lost your ticket?
It is difficult to talk to him.
I doubt if this shop will ever pay its way.
What part of Australia are you from?
"If I were a foreigner, I probably couldn't eat raw fish."
He says he must get rid of the mice that are in the attic.
Why me?
This camera is very expensive.

This is a good suggestion.
It's the best film of the year.
Do we have to help Tom?
Hundreds of fans are waiting for the singer.
Russia is facing great financial difficulties.
You're blushing.
Have you written in your diary today?
I've changed my mind again.
"If you have a problem with that, talk to the boss."
Thank you for the book.
They are running in the park.
You're a funny girl.
I'm sorry for the pain I caused you and your family.
"One, three, and five are odd numbers."
Tom's diet is deficient in protein.
She handed me a sheet of paper.
Why on earth did you give him such a name?
I won't work with him.
Lock the door!
We didn't like each other.
I can't think of anything that might help.
I thought you were into it.
"The odds are against me, so I think I'll quit now."
She promised me that she would clean my room.
I want to know where Tom lives.
I can't move my leg.
Who's in command of this unit?
Don't let him take advantage of you.
There is an urgent need for donations.
The time has come.
She looks unhappy.
I can't stand to see animals be teased.
Aren't you busy?
"Sorry, I don't have any money."
There are people who seldom speak unless they're spoken to.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
Tom had a gun.
He won't live a long life.
Maybe we should keep looking.
It can't possibly work.
I want to send a parcel to Japan.
We have a long ways to go.
Where will we eat?
My dog is white.
How's it going with you and Tom?
Mt. Fuji is Japan's most famous mountain.
I assure you that isn't necessary.
I can't believe you are eating something the doctor has told you repeatedly you shouldn't eat.
You need not have called me.
"Well then, I'll have chicken."
I can't do without her help.
Tom has lost interest in studying French.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
Tom has a lot of friends now.
Please help me with this heavy baggage.
He knows how to buy used cars.
We were listening to music.
We all laughed.
My room is three times as large as yours.
She's going to be in charge.
He was resting under a tree when an apple fell on his head.
What are you promising me?
He can do it better than me.
I checked everywhere.
Will you accompany me?
The teacher suspected the student was cheating.
Take a closer look.
Tom got Mary to laugh.
It was very cold yesterday morning.
I want you home in time for dinner.
Tom stole the ring.
He wants to see if he's still got what it takes.
Do you know when they will be back?
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
Tom wasn't contributing.
I am writing a letter.
She began to sing.
The young man is a doctor.
It's important to complete your ballot.
I love to swim.
Do you think I'm ugly?
Tom already knew the answer.
Tom heard sirens.
Tom is waiting for Mary to call.
We'll show Tom.
"Excuse me, but will you tell me the way to the station?"
I was good.
Nobody wants you to do that.
I'm easygoing.
Tom asked me if I knew anybody who could translate from French into English.
I'm having fun.
I'll put some salt in the soup.
He probably won't come.
I wonder what happened to Tom.
"I'm sorry, my boss is sleeping right now. Please come back tomorrow."
Don't you want to see Tom again?
Tom rubbed his face.
How much money did you spend on your car?
"I can't afford to buy a used car, much less a new car."
We don't want to hurt you.
Tom and I played tennis all day.
Did you know that Tom was kidnapped when he was three?
She forgot to write him.
I might be able to help you.
She watches television at night.
Everybody has left except Tom and Mary.
Tom sat on the bench and crossed his legs.
You stole my idea.
You should not give your children everything they want.
"Please speak loudly, so I can hear you."
I think this one is good.
"Apparently, Tom is still alive."
I wonder whether Tom's daughter is pretty or not.
The bottom 40% of the U.S. population has only 0.3% of the wealth.
What he did was wrong.
Tom opened the door to let the cat in.
Have the two of you met before?
Why are you asking me about this?
Tom spoke gently.
I had been working for two hours when I suddenly felt sick.
I thought he was my brother.
The situation has improved.
How's the patient feeling this morning?
We didn't kill anyone.
Close all the windows.
I know how old Tom is.
Here we go.
I am familiar with this part of town.
I can't ignore this situation anymore.
Tom and Mary both want to go.
I like President Obama.
Aardvarks are nocturnal animals.
We learn by trial and error.
The man aimed a gun at the policeman.
Please have some cookies.
We play games together.
"Not too long ago, I wasn't able to play the guitar at all."
God bless you!
I know that Tom did it on purpose.
There were a lot of people there.
Are you working?
My aim is to be a doctor.
I have to at least try.
I missed you a lot.
Is it true that you climbed this mountain?
You can't force me to do anything I don't want to do.
We'll be too late.
All these books are mine.
There is no meat left in the fridge.
You won't believe what Tom told me.
He's not smart enough to work it out in his head.
I didn't even get a chance to eat anything.
Tom is quite drunk.
Tom is a drummer.
I've got nothing to say to Tom.
Many Asians are lactose intolerant.
Have you seen the recipe book that I wrote?
"You think you know me pretty well, don't you?"
Tom believes Mary killed John.
Mary came home from school in tears because her friends had teased her.
How many of you are there?
I interpreted their silence as consent.
He's going blind.
I already know how to dance.
What line of work are you in?
Might makes right.
Where's the best place to catch fish?
I'd like to get a medical examination for my two-year-old daughter.
I like writing.
"Tom, Mary already has a boyfriend."
He won't live much longer.
Whose friend are you?
I agree with you absolutely.
Do you think her story is false?
We haven't been able to find out much yet.
When did you start writing songs?
You could've run away.
Tom wondered why Mary wasn't as busy as everybody else.
The boy has taken the toy away from his little sister.
We've got to warn Tom.
I read an exciting story.
Why should Tom sing?
Don't show your face around here again.
Don't pry into the affairs of others.
Tom likes potatoes.
"Yes, Tom actually said that."
You missed your chance.
Graham Greene is a favorite author of mine.
Is Spanish spoken in Mexico?
"Tom favorite saying is ""You can't put two saddles on one horse."""
"If you're going to the beach, you need sunscreen."
I think you will approve.
The doctor prescribed medicine for the patient.
That's totally inappropriate.
How do we know that he is who he says he is?
"Tom thought Mary was in Boston, but she was actually in Chicago."
Please explain the rule to me.
Mary tasted seaweed for the first time and liked it.
Do you really want me to tell Tom about you and Mary?
Tom said that he thought that Mary needed to do that before she left.
I can't stand this kind of movie.
Tom hasn't changed his mind.
We consumers must buy more domestic products.
She has never visited him.
You may choose whichever you want.
I let down the rope.
I was wondering the same thing.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
Tom isn't stupid.
Father has gone fishing.
There's a possibility that the man was murdered.
I'm pretty sure about it.
I was not pleased.
Tom is hanging up the laundry.
This song always reminds me of my school days.
You don't have to be here.
Happy Easter!
Please take care of my baby while I am out.
Mary wore a pale blue dress.
I met his sister last week.
Tom said that you'd be here today.
You've got my sunglasses and I want them back.
"You sure look handsome today, Tom."
"Tom didn't want to come here, but he came anyway."
I wasn't making fun of you.
I forgot to write the address on the envelope.
It's unlikely that anyone other than Tom would be interested in buying this.
My brother polished the silver.
"It being Sunday today, we have no school."
I have never read that book.
You had better have your eyes examined.
Have you ever sworn at a policeman?
Tom has big feet.
Tom will stop you.
Get under my umbrella.
You can save yourself a lot of trouble by just doing it right the first time.
She's a lot smarter than she looks.
Why isn't Tom doing this?
Tom appeared anxious.
I knew you'd like that.
Tom followed Mary here.
Tom asked Mary if he could copy her notes.
He has already said yes.
It's still possible.
So what happened?
The park was empty.
I will come by all means.
The desk has three drawers.
I want you to get me out of here.
Tom opened the freezer and got out the ice cream.
Put yourself in my place.
Here we are again.
Where's your school?
The final match was not so exciting.
I have two dogs and I try to feed them each the same amount of food.
There's no stopping Tom.
Tom's reaction was the opposite of what Mary had expected.
Tom looked good.
She is always complaining of her husband's small salary.
Can you use a computer?
Be careful! The floor is wet.
The soldier made light of his wounds.
He does not smoke.
Tom crawled into bed and pulled the covers over himself.
"Of course, it's not true."
I've just been mugged.
I have to be there at 2:30.
It's cold today so button your coat.
Tom was mad.
That's what I would've done.
When did you last sharpen this knife?
She quickly opened the letter.
I can't carry this suitcase by myself.
I can't read.
You're so lazy.
What was that noise?
Put the gun on the table.
"The moment she was alone, she opened the letter."
"I ran as fast as possible, but I was not in time for the last train."
Why don't you tell me?
"How do you say ""cat"" in Spanish?"
I wrote three letters last night.
Tom did what he was told.
This book deals with psychology.
Overfishing is a major problem.
Tom is in prison.
Tom isn't going.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
"Tom claims he doesn't watch much TV, but he watches more than three hours every day."
I wouldn't want anyone to see us.
Tom has been asking to see you.
I had two cups of coffee.
Do I look like an idiot to you?
Tom and Mary have started fighting again.
Tom was rejected.
Here's the money I borrowed from you.
I didn't tell Tom anything.
He was visibly nervous.
Tom was very angry.
Can we join in?
I've despised Tom for a long time.
I'm getting stronger every day.
This is a story about love and friendship.
Do you want to live in Boston?
What did you wear?
I'm pretty sure the first thing you'll want to do when you get to Boston is call home.
Tom respects your opinion.
You never told me you had a brother.
"If you count the baby, then there are four of us."
Tom was dressed as a vampire.
I don't worry about the past.
What'll happen to us now?
I assume Tom is up to no good.
I hope you're not planning on wearing that dress to the party.
I didn't swim.
I'm glad I listened to you.
I don't know your real name.
He drives me crazy.
Have you ever borrowed money from your company?
Did you guys hear that?
Tom often talks to himself.
Tom was completely clueless.
I don't see that there's a choice.
It's not something anyone can do.
"It does cause a problem, doesn't it?"
Come back home.
Tom squashed the bug.
I hate interviews.
She still loves him.
They grow fruit here.
Do you want to be near Tom?
I have met him before.
There's no reason both of us need to go to Boston.
Ethics is a branch of philosophy.
You had better not speak loudly in this room.
He made it for his sister.
I forgot to telephone him today.
I'm not to blame.
My fingers are so cold they have gone numb.
I don't know what's wrong with Tom.
The police aren't after us anymore.
You're really selfish.
"What is it now, Tom?"
Did you buy a round trip ticket?
Thanks for your explanation.
Wring those clothes well before you hang them up.
He lost his eyesight in an accident.
No sailboat is faster than this one.
Will there be anything else?
I'm okay.
You have to expect that to happen once in a while.
"You're my best friend, Tom."
Tom burned his hand on the hot stove.
The woman reached for the knife on the table.
They found it.
We can't give you any more details at this time.
"Hey, wait up!"
I come here every Monday.
"Frankly, I don't like your idea."
"Excuse me, could you show me how to use the washing machine?"
Did you find someone to help you?
Is this it?
Where does Tom work?
At what time does it close?
Torture is wrong.
That comes in handy.
Tom looks serious.
Would you mind repeating the question?
Look at the flowers in the park.
What's the minimum wage in your country?
Tom is too wise to do that.
Tom is a tall man.
We have decided on leaving this town tomorrow morning.
She's my daughter.
I tried not to stare.
I'm allergic to cats.
I really feel for you.
Now don't you feel better?
"You're big enough to do that by yourself, aren't you?"
Tom is horrible.
Tom was spoiled.
What's that for?
I won the lottery.
No one found any reason to criticize his actions.
I understand now why he didn't go to a university.
It took Tom fifteen minutes of googling before he found what he was looking for.
I paid him on the spot for his work.
"If you translate from your second language into your own native language, rather than the other way around, you're less likely to make mistakes."
I couldn't eat fish when I was a child.
I was caught in a traffic jam.
Tom is the leader.
What else do you know about Tom?
Did you enjoy the game?
Mary is speaking to strangers.
That mountain is easy to climb.
You're like family.
I'm yours.
Where will you go?
It's futile.
Would you like to hear about what I did last summer?
Tom woke up at 6:30.
Tom hasn't unpacked yet.
She is curious to find who sent the flowers.
This tire needs some air.
The clouds hid the sun.
They say I'm retarded.
My back still hurts.
Don't look up.
You're wearing your sweater inside out.
I know you don't remember me.
The ship dropped anchor.
I'm extremely sorry.
You're not looking.
Did you bring it?
He was wrong in thinking that she'd come to see him.
How long have you been learning French?
I want to do this at home.
Please shut the door.
Tom cursed himself for his carelessness.
I think Tom will be interested.
Don't push your luck.
I told her to sit down and to drink a glass of water.
"How did you get in here? ""I climbed in through the window."""
Do you know who that guy is?
Would you like another cookie?
It's on me.
You have a family to think of.
I did no such thing.
You're better able to do it than I am.
I have plenty of friends.
Does that guy look familiar to you?
The bullet found its mark.
"I spent 3,000 yen on a new CD."
Tom is wearing suspenders.
What time do you think you'll likely arrive?
They hadn't gone very far when they met an old man.
I had no choice but to accept.
America is a country of immigrants.
How much of this stuff is yours?
I oppose it.
Did you find someone to help you?
I'll do everything you tell me to do.
I would like a cup of coffee.
Tom is about the same age as you are.
Do you think Tom would enjoy doing that?
I'd never do anything like that.
I can't keep up with you if you walk so fast.
How was your stay?
I didn't expect her to ask me that question.
She had a blue dress on at the party yesterday.
I baked you some cookies.
Can you prove that what you said is true?
I made spaghetti.
Tom hasn't yet heard anything definite about whether he got into Harvard or not.
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
Tom can't take his eyes off Mary.
We didn't even discuss it.
You'd better do what I suggest.
My mind was blank.
I seldom speak to him.
I did no such thing.
"Tom will eventually give in, I think."
This is an easy question.
Let me tell you a little about myself.
We enjoyed having you as our guest.
I make it a rule to brush my teeth before I go to bed.
Be careful not to fall overboard.
Could you recommend a nice restaurant near here?
Can you get us some more ice?
I thought I had the right to fire anyone I wanted to.
Tom is a total nutcase.
Tom's mother chased Tom as he ran naked around the lobby.
She went there to swim.
What're you looking for?
It was in 1989 that the Berlin Wall was taken down.
I'll be happy to help you look for an apartment.
Do you want to see Tom again?
I hate karaoke.
I met some friends while I was waiting for a bus.
You remind me of my son.
Open your mouth wide.
I think I'm going to stay here.
I just want you back.
I don't know what Tom knows.
How many foreign languages do you know?
We had to call off the game because of rain.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
I don't want to talk to you.
We were surprised how fast the police were there.
That is not what the narrative is about.
The ticket is good through Monday.
I pressed my ear to the door to see if I could hear what Tom and Mary were talking about.
It looks like rain. You had better take an umbrella with you.
Stop showing off!
That's more than I can handle alone.
Are you seriously thinking about getting married again at your age?
I didn't know you were so ambitious.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
The cargo ship arrived four hours early.
Do you really think Tom is better than me?
There is a key on the desk.
They were very professional.
How many rackets do you have?
Tom's mother is a very good cook.
What've you been doing recently?
I won't be staying with you.
She lost her way and on top of that it began to rain.
"As soon as Tom heard the gunshots, he ran out of the house."
"Where is Grandma? ""She's sleeping on the couch."""
She was in a green coat and matching mini-skirt.
He catches colds easily.
I don't want a horse.
I just got up.
Do you have it?
I woke up at five this morning.
Tom couldn't find his left shoe.
Tom is going to make some changes.
Do you have a room that's a little cheaper?
Sorry for not answering your question. I didn't see it.
The Queen's crown was made of gold.
Why are you in such a hurry?
Tom was carrying his snowboard under his arm.
"There were few, if any, trees."
Please write your name at the bottom of this paper.
I like astrology.
She put the blanket over the child sleeping on the sofa.
I wish you luck.
Give me a blank sheet of paper.
She didn't show up at the party yesterday.
I came home at 2:30.
Radishes aren't difficult to grow.
He has a crush on this girl.
They're going to attack.
She was the first girl I'd ever kissed.
When are you going back to your own country?
Thank you for giving me this.
Tom watched Mary.
Today is the first day of spring.
I live in this house by myself.
Why would I steal your wallet?
I went to Vienna for the first time last year.
Do you still want to buy your wife a car?
The view from the summit is very nice.
Tom was well prepared for the exam.
I'll give him this message the moment he arrives.
We must be cautious.
We tried to convince Tom not to do it.
He's the best man in his field.
Do you think French is difficult?
I was worried.
I can't pay you back the money you lent me.
Tom trusted me.
Tom said he couldn't help Mary.
I never thought anything of it.
He has made up his mind to buy the car.
What are you looking at?
This is a life-sized statue.
I have an idea what it is.
Put the book back where it was.
Trade between two countries can be complex.
She tried a third time.
I come from Japan.
I thought it was really good.
I still don't believe it!
Take off your shoes.
I won't unload the car because that's somebody else's job.
I'll take the yellow one.
You don't know my brother.
He's a bit of a loner.
I thought we settled that matter last night.
The young girl was in the next room playing with a doll.
Tom and Mary were seated next to each other in the back seat of John's car.
The announcer called for attention.
These are the originals.
Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.
Did you go to see a doctor?
I don't want you to quit playing the piano.
He congratulated me on my success.
Her eyes ran over the list to see if her name was on it.
He hurried to the station.
Please turn around and look at me.
The soul is immortal.
I met him at the end of the platform.
The statement is not wholly true.
Tom left after me.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
May I borrow your dictionary?
I hope Tom will tell me what I need to know.
Now stop crying.
Tom is in Boston with his parents.
Tom was embarrassed.
Stop acting like you understand me.
I've lost my glasses.
He went out of his way to help me.
They did not agree with all of Oglethorpe's ideas.
Tom talked to me about his plans.
I felt something touch my feet.
Mary is 36 weeks pregnant.
It won't be that hard.
You'd better relax a bit.
What else can I do?
Tom isn't serious.
Tom is interested in French music.
Why does Tom want to do that?
I saw a sleeping dog.
I wasn't here yesterday.
I deal with those kinds of problems every day.
Where did you live last year?
Tom said he thought he heard Mary snoring in the back of the classroom.
She applied for a visa.
Are these your things?
We want to talk with Tom.
Everyone is ready.
This table is made of good oak.
It wasn't until Tom was 30 years old that he found out that he was adopted.
I think she's over 40 years old.
I saw Tom do that.
We don't have much in common.
Sweden's population is growing.
I suggest that we stay home and watch TV.
Why don't you give it up?
Tom thinks Mary made the right choice.
Tom was dying to meet Mary.
What makes you ask that?
He took his wallet out of his pocket.
Do you like this blouse?
I'm not an only child.
You shouldn't have brought Tom with you.
I don't like music as much as you do.
What'll Tom think?
This was my idea.
We have tried everything.
Is there something in particular that you want to hear?
Is something the matter with Tom?
Flying kites can be dangerous.
I assumed you'd want me to pay.
I've got Tom's address somewhere on my computer.
Tom massaged Mary's stiff shoulders.
I ran across a rare book in a secondhand bookstore.
We don't have tea.
I haven't heard anything.
Tom tends to be late for meetings.
Tom is not a happy man.
Can I help you with that?
I think Tom has been punished enough.
Shut up and listen!
I can survive alone.
I'm so embarrassed.
"You don't know, do you?"
The prisoner was set free yesterday.
You're the only person I know that never complains about the food here.
We've got to be careful.
I was invited to their wedding.
I bought 24 pencils.
You should've come to the party.
We had lunch at a little coffee shop.
I'm going to come.
The poem's rhyme scheme is highly complex.
Is Tom Canadian?
Tom knows that Mary likes him.
Tom passed away last night.

Tom is packing.
We forgot to lock the door.
It's starting to snow.
Don't let Tom eat this.
You mean a lot to me.
I'm glad you got home safely.
These are my boys.
I'd like two kilos of onions.
I will come back next week.
"This hall holds 2,000 people."
Northern lights appear all year round in Greenland.
I know every inch of the town.
We have to do without sugar.
"At home, we speak only French."
Don't think I didn't try.
"First, we have to find out where they live."
Many wives complain about high prices.
I turned off the tap.
The policemen wore gas masks and helmets.
Tom seems shocked.
We can't have you working for us.
You're tempting fate.
Your watch is ten minutes slow.
I do not like spring.
That man ate bread.
You should do that right away.
I received a letter in French last week.
They're cannibals.
Let's see what will happen.
John is two years older than me.
I'm not doing that.
"Yesterday, Tom told me he couldn't speak French."
The gate was too narrow for the truck.
I'll be at home the next time she comes.
He's a good man.
Tom knew he didn't need to do what Mary told him needed to be done.
Supplies of oil are not infinite.
"Unfortunately, that's true."
I make an honest living.
Tom has to stay in the house because he has the chicken pox.
Do you see me?
Tom spent all afternoon at the airport watching the airplanes land and take off.
Can you also count in Italian?
I can teach you how to repair a computer.
"She seldom, if ever, goes to bed before eleven."
He told them to stay on the north side of the river.
My watch loses three minutes a day.
"Because of the bad weather, the plane was delayed three hours."
Tom wanted me to tell you to buy a couple of loaves of bread on your way home.
I heard you crying.
"I didn't know you could cook this well, Tom."
What's going on with kids these days?
They tied the thief to the tree.
Nothing we have done today has gone according to plan.
He gave me all his money.
You're the most beautiful woman I know.
I don't want Tom to see this.
You look just like your older brother.
"Actually, I do have one small complaint."
He started to sing.
Tom looked horrified.
No news is good news.
What is Gestalt Therapy?
Tell me your plan.
Have I changed that much?
Let's start here.
Tom and Mary speak to each other in English.
I'm leaving Boston.
I'm sorry. I really have to go.
How do you like your new car?
"I know him by sight, but I have never actually spoken to him."
It's not exactly a secret.
Tom hummed a tune to himself as he did the washing up.
I don't trust you anymore.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
She claims that she knows nothing about him.
My husband is at work.
This is my room.
Did you lie to your parents?
Where are they taking you?
Read the bottom of the page.
They called.
He played his trump card.
He can't cook very well.
I hope nothing ruins our last day together.
I'm so ashamed.
"Tom asked Mary out, but she said no."
"The British troops fought hard, but could not stop the Germans."
We studied more than 800 Chinese characters.
What are you going to do with that?
Tom shut himself up in his room.
"Will you buy me some bread, please?"
Tom will remain.
The question is who is going to tell him.
Tom and Mary have very different personalities.
Where do you come from?
You're inconsiderate.
The player retired from the basketball team.
Tom is grilling meat.
Is the bridge safe?
My father won't allow me to keep a dog.
Why are you locking the door?
I must remind you of your promise.
You are in very serious trouble.
What's your favorite song on this album?
I'll be back in less than five minutes.
I've got a lot of work to do.
My father is busy.
I've got this little job I want you to do.
Parts of the book are quite good.
What's your message?
Please tell me about your problem.
He lost his temper and hit the boy.
He hesitated for a moment.
No one knows what happened.
Tom shut one window and Mary shut the other.
She needs our help.
This is the man I told you about.
She earns her living by teaching.
Tom seems to be bored.
I'll get help.
I don't know when he'll come back.
He is confident of his ability.
She has many dogs.
Tom's family loved Mary.
He gave her a box.
I don't have time to eat lunch right now.
Don't keep bad company.
The basket was full of apples.
Logical thinking is not my strength.
Here is a letter for you.
What did you mean by this sentence?
"As soon as I sat down, I fell asleep."
Is Tom in love with you?
Tom and Mary are still there.
You don't realize its value until you have lost your health.
Send it by airmail.
I visited the village where he was born.
Let's talk over a cup of coffee.
Did you wash your hair?
World War II came to an end in the 20th year of the Showa era.
Tom and Mary know the truth.
His knowledge of geography is insufficient.
Tom often stays up most of the night.
You shouldn't expect things to be easy.
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
I thought you'd left.
The doctors don't know what's wrong with Tom.
I'm next.
You make me happy.
I'll decide that later.
I will always be there for you.
When shall we meet again?
All of them are good teachers.
Laughing really is good for you.
Tom wants to quit.
"Hey, I know what I want."
He is busy writing a letter.
I don't know if it's true or not.
Don't you want to go to Boston with me?
I came here for that reason.
Stars are shining in the sky.
Has Tom spoken to you about me?
Do you remember what the girl who was with me last night was wearing?
Hokkaido is in the northern part of Japan.
He is sometimes absent from school.
I'm devastated.
Do I need to go there?
My father always gets nervous.
Tom is much taller than you.
"Do you like to travel? ""Yes."""
Tom is a few months older than Mary.
"When I woke up, it was still dark outside."
I only speak a smattering of Japanese.
We're just trying to help you.
Would you mind if I smoke?
I have no idea how to do deal with my daughter.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval.
He knows how to speak to children.
You're with friends.
I sometimes pray in the meeting room.
What is the subject of your lecture?
I made a bet.
We chartered a bus.
Tom and Mary played hide-and-seek.
I wish I'd kept up my French.
Tom doesn't often do that.
I broke up with her.
My aunt looks young.
Tom also has a daughter.
Where is my son?
"Tom, Mary, John and Alice are friends. They've known each other since they were children."
Do you think it's dangerous to eat genetically modified food?
Is Monday OK?
I wish you'd told me that a bit earlier.
Tom couldn't sleep.
Teaching children is easier than teaching adults.
You can't imagine how happy she was.
I prepared a weak sugar solution.
Tom is wearing gloves.
I've read all of these books several times each.
Golf isn't my cup of tea.
"If we walk, we'll be very late."
I bet it works.
No mountain in Japan is higher than Mt. Fuji.
No one knows yet.
Her daughter has become a beautiful woman.
I'll be going.
I have misjudged you.
Tom is too lenient with his students.
I shouldn't have logged off.
Tom made me look through his photo album.
He invested his money in stocks.
Do you have a ticket?
He came to Berlin as a teacher.
I moved to a new office this week.
They took on more than they could handle.
When do you go back to Japan?
Tom knew that Mary wasn't happy.
Are you Mary's husband?
What floor do you live on?
It exploded with a loud noise.
"What's important is not the goal, but the journey."
Tom felt a chill go up his spine.
We must find something to plug up this hole.
Thank you very much for your letter of January 7th.
Do you live there?
He nodded to me as he passed.
Tom won't starve.
I have only just arrived.
Please don't change anything.
Please lend me your book.
Tom needs open heart surgery.
You should've said yes.
I like my life.
I know what this is.
Their ship is still in port.
Tom sat on the grass next to Mary.
The factory is running at full capacity.
Tom never drinks with his students.
"Tom was sitting under a tree, drinking wine."
You did that on purpose.
Please write down everything I say.
Tom is going to really be pleased.
It was a partial success.
Tom has just returned from the post office.
They are well looked after.
I know what's in the box.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
Tom hesitated to bring up the subject.
The man fell down on the ground.
She fumbled with a piece of paper.
Tom doesn't shave very often.
He was obviously in pain.
Don't forget to take your pills.
He threw away a bunch of old letters.
How do you write your last name?
Tom went to a private school.
There are many more students in the classroom today than yesterday.
I can't keep up with you.
Tom didn't have time to finish his report.
I was working when it happened.
Tom drew two squares on the blackboard.
She tried it herself.
I'll have something for you soon.
Has the bell rung yet?
I just asked because I thought you would know.
"Hey, Tom, can I ask you something?"
I like what I like.
Don't be alarmed.
My pen is new.
A young man broke into my house last night.
This is not normal.
Tom won't be able to tell us anything.
The Medieval Era gave way to the Renaissance.
Please be honest.
She is proud of her sons.
Tom is a gifted painter.
Tom was outraged.
We'll start whenever you are ready.
Tom Jackson has released a new album.
I have horrible heartburn.
May I ask you a favor?
I'm in trouble. I need your help.
Should I ask her out?
He's handsome and charming.
She is his friend.
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
I can't resist a woman who knows what she wants.
I don't want to take your money.
The door opened automatically.
You have a beautiful house.
"Sorry, but that's not what I ordered."
Don't speak to me about Tom. We're on bad terms.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
"I worked hard all day, so I was very tired."
Have you heard anything about the organization?
This train is made up of seven cars.
Do you want to use mine?
We're trying to find an antidote.
Stop! You're making him cry.
I'm not going skating today.
Tom painted the wall white.
He hoped to succeed.
Tom caught up with Mary.
I can't quit thinking about you.
What's the fastest way to get to the airport from here?
I can't pretend to be something I'm not.
"Here, let me try."
I hope to see you soon.
Can you open the door for me?
I hear you're very rich.
When did you ask Tom?
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom closed his eyes and fell asleep.
You seem to be making progress.
I was away for a year.
Mary set the basket on the table.
Tom has rabbits.
Tom called.
She is always finding fault with her neighbors.
The weather has a great deal to do with our health.
You're uninteresting.
He is a medical student.
Tom spent ten days in a coma after the accident.
He found it difficult to make himself understood in German.
Don't you know what to say?
We've got a mechanical problem.
I'm not the least bit worried about losing my job.
It's easier to die than to love.
Take care of your own affairs yourself.
Shake before using.
Do you know who wrote this novel?
Is this your first visit?
All of us speak French.
My mother is on a diet.
I couldn't remember the title of that song.
The hotel he's living in is downtown.
An older man was sitting on the bench.
Tom pretended to be dead.
The future will come soon enough.
Do you know her at all?
That is not the point in question.
The province is rich in mineral resources.
Wait here for me.
I find this difficult to believe.
Many Americans protested the purchase of Alaska.
You will see the difference.
Kids are smarter than you think.
You can't blame her for what she did.
A gun might come in handy.
Three years have passed since then.
Who are those guys?
Tom made a few serious mistakes.
How long is this?
What kind of deal did you make with Tom?
They sent up a balloon.
I stopped laughing.
"Our company has a long, long history."
Your stupid remark just added fuel to the flames.
I'll make some tea.
I used to enjoy playing tennis with Tom.
He looks like a good boy.
A spell of fine weather enabled us to get the harvest in safely.
It's good to have you home.
I'll go to Tom.
It's the cops!
There's no reason for concern.
Help Tom.
Tom's heart started racing.
I'm old enough to live by myself.
Save me a seat.
You will miss the train if you don't hurry.
Stars are shining in the sky.
"On hearing the news, he rushed out of the house."
Tom looks like he's about to cry.
They blamed the driver for the accident.
You are a good boy.
The boy didn't change his opinion.
Even a child can understand that.
Please tell me where we're going.
Take care of the kids for me.
The Republican candidate won the election.
What's your favorite Harry Potter book?
I was born in Hiroshima in 1945.
You should consider the problem.
Happy holidays.
Monday's not good.
You're joking!
I think it's unlikely that plants feel pain.
I will write down your name and address.
Tom and I don't do that.
I played tennis.
"Are you satisfied, Tom?"
Tom brought plenty of food.
Tom doesn't look like the man in the picture.
What've I ever done to you?
Tom has no chance of recovering.
No one ever doubted that Tom would win.
I forgot about that.
I will do my duty to the best of my ability.
I invited my neighbors to dinner.
How do you plead?
Somebody stole it from me.
We live in the atomic age.
Don't insult my intelligence.
He is a DJ.
Are you happy about this?
Do you know when she will come?
I know what Tom saw.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.
"Tom liked Mary for years, but at some point, his feelings for her changed to love."
Where can I find Tom?
"With more education, he would have found a better job."
Thanks for your patience.
Tom thinks that the sun revolves around the earth.
Buy whatever you need.
I haven't done that since high school.
"You aren't going to tell Tom, are you?"
I washed my hands as usual.
Tom motioned for me to leave.
He went by me without noticing me.
How deep is it?
Tom spent the night in his van.
Could you say that again?
Supplies of food were low and we had to ration out the little that was left.
Tom knows guns.
I'm not old fashioned.
You're giving me the same old line.
Your father won't buy it.
A man appeared at the door.
Have you checked your calculations?
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand French well."
"As for me, I don't like eggs."
Tom went out to eat.
Tom is expecting to meet you here.
Stay calm.
Was anybody else absent?
I don't want to fight with you.
"You liked that movie, didn't you?"
Have you noticed anything suspicious?
Let's see.
See you at 2:30.
These rules are not very clear.
She ran as fast as possible.
Did you see what she was wearing?
Tom can afford to buy Mary anything she wants.
Thanks for dropping by.
That's not a useful piece of information.
Nobody's suggesting you do that.
Tom was totally snockered before the party even began.
There is no going back.
All Tom can think about is Mary.
"It sounds strange, but it is true none the less."
Do you live in Boston?
We learned that he had an accident.
"Even though he was poor, he was happy."
Why didn't you use a pay phone?
"If you cannot work out the problem, you had better try a different method."
We watch TV every day.
Tom is a skillful carpenter.
It was apparent that there was no way out.
Somebody laughed.
Mary closed the door quietly.
Tom got into Mary's car.
Tom is taking pictures.
How do I get one of those?
How many times a day do you feed your dog?
Tom has to act now.
I need to buy one.
I can't raise my right arm.
Where are all the others?
Employees are prohibited from watching the Olympics.
We had fine weather on that day.
It serves you right.
They're playing cards.
I think it's highly unlikely that we'll be able to escape from this prison.
Tom said he found his keys.
I'm learning so much from you.
She visited him on October 20th.
That shop has many customers.
She seems to be happy.
Tom doesn't think we'll do that.
I plan to contact Tom by phone tomorrow and ask him to help us.
International traders are struggling just to get by.
I intend to come with you.
I hate this job.
Tom and Mary looked at each other nervously.
Tom seems pleased.
What time is your flight home?
Do you know who killed Tom?
He doesn't seem to be an American.
Did you just say something to me?
"You're still a student, aren't you?"
Tom looks asleep.
Are you on Facebook?
Make yourselves comfortable.
"Be sure to get in touch with me, if there is anything I can do for you."
Tom had to catch a taxi.
Tom complains all the time.
I have a high opinion of this book.
We really hope another war will not break out.
Everyone liked her because she was very kind.
The sun always sets in the west.
That's how I would do it.
I was told that I should see a doctor.
I'm not going to do this again.
She took care of his wound.
Her behavior isn't normal for a young girl.
I was scolded by my teacher.
The woman who is sitting on the sofa is my grandmother.
They were really cold.
How could you humiliate me like that?
Tom knows what's coming.
Tom says he doesn't have very much money on him right now.
That man ruined them completely.
Tom wrote Mary a soppy love letter and she kept reading it over and over.
Eggs are sold by the dozen.
Who do you think would be the best person for the job?
I don't know.
Are Tom and John brothers?
I'm learning Czech.
Have you fixed the thermostat?
All sales are final.
What's your name again?
Tom doesn't know how to play the piano.
She laid the child down gently.
"Tom didn't want to pay that much for eggs, so he didn't buy any."
"Now that you are an adult, you should know better."
"I don't drink beer. I do, however, drink wine."
I'm going to be a father.
I want you to reconsider your decision.
What are you cooking?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
The heat was responsible for the meat going bad.
We beat three teams.
We're always going there! Let's go to a French restaurant for a change.
Tom is a failure as a father.
Why don't you have one?
I don't know how to explain it.
Everyone should choose at least one poem and learn it by heart.
I'm in a hurry today.
Meeting new people is scary.
Where's my hat?
They did not clap for us.
Tom was much stronger when he was younger.
Tom testified against Mary.
It's a book on animals.
Tom is signing documents.
I'm retired.
"What would you do, if you were me?"
It wasn't hard.
You had better go to bed now.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
I don't know which key to use.
Is that a cat?
That's it.
Can't you buy a car?
We hope you'll enjoy your stay.
We're out of tea.
There's something here Tom should see.
"Have a great weekend, everybody."
Please introduce me to her.
I'm not going to fire you.
I just couldn't do it.
Do you think Tom killed himself?
Go away!
I've got a frog in my throat.
He attempted suicide.
Tom is always busy.
Do exactly as I say.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
You can't keep hiding from the truth.
"If you see a mistake, then please correct it."
I think we should go now.
"If you don't study, you won't pass the exam."
Tom always works a lot.
Do you still want to be an officer?
Tom groped for the flashlight that had fallen behind the couch.
Tom accidentally shot himself.
Wait till six.
I'm not certain what to do.
Tom didn't think that would ever happen.
We're doing this for the money.
The time has come for you to play your trump card.
Tom has charisma.
Have you been in Boston long?
My leg is still asleep.
You've both been very helpful.
You're making me waste time.
Throw down your gun.
I abhor violence.
I don't want to lose you.
Cook for me.
The wind fanned the flames.
What would you buy if you won the lottery?
I made no promises.
There's a big pile of mail on your desk.
I want one.
He seems to know us.
Tom isn't a young guy anymore.
There's no salad oil left.
Be careful not to trip and fall.
Tom is in his late thirties.
Was the bank closed?
He was underwater for three minutes.
My family is very important to me.
We're not here to arrest you.
You should've left it to me.
Tom didn't say much.
I've had a crush on you since I first saw you.
I can't take any calls right now.
Who can afford to buy such an expensive house?
What goes on in here?
Your French is improving.
Tom knows what he's going to do.
I don't belong to any club.
He was mistaken for his younger brother.
This is life!
"You don't want to make Tom mad, do you?"
You're the last hope for humanity.
I'll show you how this game is played.
The church is decorated with flowers for the wedding.
Remember that we have a meeting on October 20th at 2:30.
You are a good cook.
Tom tried to embrace Mary.
Tom is from a rich Boston family.
The poor child suffers from hay fever.
He can be trusted.
I'm going to go see Tom.
He gave up smoking two years ago.
Health is better than wealth.
Is Tom going home?
A lot of people think that whales are fish.
Go there with me.
Mary has just come home.
"Excuse me, what did you say?"
This isn't the first time that this has happened to me.
She stood by him.
I'm going to go call the police.
Your question is very hard to answer.
Tom lives here.
"Do it right now, before you forget."
These walls aren't exactly soundproof.
Tom had no idea what time Mary would get home.
May I swim in this lake?
You did that on purpose.
Tom yawned.
The only restaurant that Tom really likes is the one across the street.
Do you have any idea who would do this?
Please write your name at the bottom of this paper.
She is a mere child.
Tom put on his snowshoes.
Tom's driver's license will expire next month.
It was her that told me.
Don't cry.
"Even though he has money, he isn't happy."
All our money is gone.
Stop sucking up to the teacher.
I'll go and see if Tom is OK.
A good idea suddenly struck me.
Life begins when we realize who we really are.
They were dead.
I suppose you're hungry.
No one is coming.
Where does she want to go?
The trademark is very well known.
I graduated from an American school in France.
The meeting took place yesterday.
It has an important influence upon our lives.
There are many words that I don't understand.
The events unfolded just as she predicted.
I was offended by her crude manners.
He resigned from the post.
We must be as kind to old people as possible.
What will we tell the others?
"You're not taking it, are you?"
A dog followed me to my house.
Get off me.
Tom has been found guilty.
When did you come to Paris?
Tom said that it might be true.
I want proof.
Can you decipher the message?
Tom gave me his number.
Do you live around here?
I've never seen anything like this.
Tom gives us what we want.
Were there any witnesses?
Tom will drive you to the airport.
That woman's name is Mary.
That's very good news.
You're really talented.
You have to make up the time you have lost.
Tom resumed clearing the table.
You'll feel better after a bath.
This merchandise is tax free.
The cause of the fire was unknown.
He is busy typing the reports.
"If it snows on the mountain, it is cold in the valley."
Will we be there soon?
It smells bad.
I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
I like it in Boston.
The children are going to the beach today.
I watched a movie on video.
Do you have other family?
He worked long into the night.
Tom said he saw the invisible man today.
Do you have other family?
We're not so confident.
We're neighbors.
"He is short, but strong."
The men are wearing short sleeve shirts.
Tom wasn't crying.
It is absolutely impossible.
Is this Canadian money?
Tom burst into the room.
Such a ridiculous superstition no longer exists.
I have to stop drinking.
I know this has been hard for you.
Tom lacks common sense.
Tom was afraid to swim.
Tom doesn't want to discourage Mary.
Tom has some explaining to do.
"All right, let's give it a try."
It's quite unlikely Tom will win.
Have you found something?
Please call a taxi for me.
They want us to do it.
These books are my books.
Watching wild birds is a lot of fun.
You're stronger than the rest of us.
Tell your son not to harass my daughter anymore.
Please tell me the answer to the question.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
She likes birdwatching.
Mary is prettier than Alice.
Don't expect anything to happen too soon.
Tom came home drunk from a party.
They were leaving Japan the next day.
What's the spelling of your family name?
I want it with plenty of ice.
I lay on my face.
Tom didn't mention that he'd met Mary.
You guys are pathetic.
"You're scared. ""No, I'm not."""
You may go anywhere you like.
Haven't I suffered enough?
I have to study for the test.
You're unbelievable.
It's the only way to find out.
We may have a problem.
Is this room Tom's?
"Tom isn't rich, but he's happy."
The dogs died inside the hot vehicle.
Take off your cap.
Tom didn't make it to the station on time.
Is there a train station near here?
Do you know why she couldn't come?
I couldn't have done it without you.
I don't know where I'll live.
I don't care for him.
Tom ate by himself even though he had hoped to eat with Mary.
He is as tall as her.
Maru crawled out from under the table.
I might never see you again.
That's complicating the matter.
We should let sleeping dogs lie.
The next flight is at 10:00.
Why does anyone learn Esperanto?
The noise was so loud that it was a nuisance to the neighbors.
Please let us know.
This custom began in the Edo Period.
Stay away from our house.
That didn't take long.
He has a large number of books on his bookshelf.
Tom is sharpening a knife.
The leader of our party met with the other leaders and talked about the problem.
Maybe some other time.
Your daughter isn't a girl anymore.
I'll visit my uncle next week.
Are you sure that you have enough money?
The sky was filled with airplanes.
Does Tom really want to know?
His book deals with traffic accidents.
Mary was the most beautiful woman at Tom's party.
Did Tom say he didn't need to do that?
"He was way behind on his rent. As a result, he was evicted from his apartment."
Isn't talking about dreams boring?
What's the hurry?
There's a serious problem.
Could you give me that piece of paper?
Tom is a happy man.
I especially like your chocolate cake.
The wedding is less than three months away.
He looks nothing like a doctor.
Tom can't get over how Mary treated him.
He has never been abroad.
Tom can't keep his eyes off Mary.
Someone is coming.
My African violet died because I overwatered it.
What does this have to do with us?
It's no big thing.
Who's going?
The room is now ready for you.
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
I thought the game was over.
There is nothing interesting in the newspaper.
Tom has suggested one possible solution.
"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the seven days of the week."
Tom watched Mary.
Tom visited four countries.
Why do they do that?
She doesn't speak Japanese at home.
Do you feel up to it?
Tom has a couple of friends who speak French well.
"If you need my help, all you have to do is ask."
I wear glasses.
She has dry hair.
Tom says he can't stay long.
Let's go and see Tom.
I went up to the 5th floor in an elevator.
It's going to collapse.
What is this car doing here?
I can teach you how to read.
It can't get worse.
It's about time you went to school.
You can't leave me here alone with Tom.
"He had nothing to say, so he left."
They were my friends.
We're from here.
Tom stole Mary's phone and took a bunch of selfies before sneaking it back into her purse.
Why do you like Boston?
Tom seemed naive.
Please don't listen to Tom.
The astronauts were greeted with cheers and applause of an enthusiastic crowd.
It looks like an apple.
Tom wanted people to like him.
Give me a piece of paper.
Tom got a small portion of pie.
When's the last time you showered?
I'll go with you as far as the bridge.
The girl caught a small fish.
Tom corrected it.
Are you certain you've made the right decision?
We are from France.
It's more fun than studying.
He insulted our team.
That hat looks good on you.
My life would be meaningless without you.
Why don't we go downstairs?
I bought an old car.
I look forward to reading your report.
He has no idea what he's doing.
Could you help us translate this text?
I do not know if it will rain tomorrow.
Maybe your earring is under the table.
Tom ran as fast as he could to escape from the angry bear.
Nothing will determine our success as a nation in the 21st century more than how well we educate our kids.
Do you really think this is OK?
This dictionary is completely useless.
Now do you see?
"The teacher said, ""That's all for today."""
"It makes sense, doesn't it?"
All you have to do is to meet her there.
When should I stop feeding my dog puppy food?
He seemed really nervous.
I applied for the job and got it.
Don't get so excited!
Tom grew up in a small town in Australia.
I know what Tom needs to do.
Tom isn't going to go with us.
Tom lumbered along like an elephant.
The volcano may erupt at any moment.
I came back home late.
Whose textbook is this?
Did you feed the dog?
What don't you like about your job?
Tom will never stop loving Mary.
Tom wondered how many times he'd have to tell Mary to clean her room before she finally did.
It's better that way.
I tried writing with my left hand.
Tom has been avoiding Mary.
What's that awful smell?
I saw what I saw.
Why are you so interested all of a sudden?
He set off to Paris.
Where's it from?
Draw a small circle.
I also found every letter he had ever written to my mother.
It's nearly three o'clock.
It will be quitting time before you get that done.
Tom bought a gift for Mary.
Four families were killed in the fire.
I'll carry you.
I will find a way to repay you.
I wish you didn't have to leave.
Tom wanted to punish me.
Japan is not what it was ten years ago.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Tom and Mary quickly got into their car and drove away.
We went to the café that I told you about.
What am I going to do without Tom?
Let's continue from where we left off.
It can't be true.
I'm seeing her this evening.
It's impolite to stare at people.
That's a good response.
That's an old wives' tale.
Salmon is my favorite fish to eat.
How does the film end?
Tom cut down a cherry tree.
We don't trust strangers around here.
Have you discovered anything new today?
They're very happy.
Onions can be used in many dishes.
"Even if it isn't true, it's still rather clever."
Tom didn't do it on purpose.
I just have a few questions for you.
It's interesting.
I'd like to see my art teacher this afternoon.
I don't think this is funny.
She stopped smoking.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
I need to sit down.
Would you like to say anything?
Attention please!
Tom inhaled deeply.
I didn't want to dance with Tom.
Most young adults enjoy going out at night.
Tom convinced Mary that she was wrong.
He has trouble remembering names.
I don't want that and I know you don't want that either.
Tom waited a moment and then got up to leave.
You are expected to pass the exam.
This hat is too big for you.
There's absolutely no reason not to do that.
They aren't here.
I thought Tom loved me.
Are these your own books?
How are we going to get by?
Mary is very beautiful.
You must keep the promises you make.
Stop thinking about it.
I've known that for a long time.
I have no hair on my head.
"In most of the countries in Europe, cars have to keep to the right."
Thank you for the beautiful roses.
Tom gave Mary the money.
Can I ask why not?
Don't worry about such a silly thing.
I thought it would be a good idea.
Everybody applauded.
Tom knows that I don't care whether he comes with us or not.
They lost no time in getting the sick man to a hospital.
"This is a secret just between you and me, so don't let it slip out."
Isn't it wonderful how things work out?
May I ask you to help me with something?
"If you were in my place, what would you do?"
Tom is insanely rich.
Tom deleted all the files off his thumb drive.
Your parents must've been worried.
We're leaving now.
They sat side by side.
He was nearly drowned.
Do you like my friend?
Tom taught Mary how to play chess.
I like to read books.
I thought you wouldn't like me.
Have you ever been fingerprinted?
His conduct was admirable.
Do you think our climate has an influence on our character?
Ice melts in the sun.
My son grew 5 inches last year.
That's not love.
"Now, what was your name again?"
You should have attended the meeting.
You're moody.
I hope that my sister will pass the entrance examination.
Why are you crying?
Life was a lot simpler back then.
Tom mowed the lawn.
How do I get to Gate 5?
Tom and Mary haven't arrived yet.
You must not touch the paintings.
The girl didn't say anything.
I'd be careful.
He couldn't stop smiling.
Tom isn't the same man he used to be.
Does anyone here know French?
I spent the whole day playing with my kids.
Tom has low self-esteem.
Sit still.
Slavery in the United States was not abolished until 1865.
There's a farm close by.
I can assure you everything has been taken care of.
She has many friends.
I know where we are.
It's too early to leave.
Tom is now a college student.
You have the same racket as I have.
I can teach you how to repair your car.
There is no choice in this matter.
The door may be locked.
The boy could not find his way out of the maze.
I have something else I want you to do for me.
I heard about the problems Tom caused.
I'm working on something.
We'll let Mary prepare dinner for us tonight.
They promised not to go on strike during the conference.
He talked to the chairperson.
"My name is Tom, too."
I'm very sorry I came home so late.
This book contains a lot of short stories.
He sat down to read a story.
Where is your sister?
You must steer clear of that gang.
Tom is deceitful.
She received the electricity bill today.
Please step aside.
Make the time to do it.
Don't forget to call your mom.
I didn't sleep long enough.
I think you owe her an explanation.
I'm back.
Tom had to start over again.
Don't be rude.
I don't think Tom would like it very much if I used his electric beard trimmer without his permission.
I like short poems.
It's the only possible conclusion.
Where's your date tonight?
Take a number.
She's afraid of the dark.
Tom currently doesn't have a job.
They're in the shower.
Would it bother you if I smoke?
What do you think she is doing now?
What caused the explosion?
He doesn't want to admit that he has a drinking problem.
I'll finish what I started.
Is there a cure for stupidity?
The other children call him Fatty.
Wait in the waiting room.
Tom never seems to know what to say.
Tom cleaned out his bank accounts and disappeared.
Do you want me to do that?
Why are you washing your hands?
Tom is a teenager.
Few passengers survived the catastrophe.
"When she was a student, she went to the disco only once."
We have to expect the worst.
Don't worry. We have plenty of water and food.
He's homeward bound.
Tom has to do that tomorrow.
I've answered your questions.
Many young men went to war.
Tom can give you advice about that.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Three civilians were also killed.
Tom managed to escape from the room where his kidnappers had kept him locked up.
Tom got engaged to Mary.
I want to live at home with my family.
Tom had to borrow money from Mary to pay his rent.
Tom whispered something into Mary's ear and she smiled.
You shouldn't speak so ill of him.
It is no joke.
Where did you learn English?
I can't remember why I did that.
I really don't understand this problem.
Tom has three daughters.
We're pretty proud of ourselves.
I met him on the street the other day.
The earth rotates.
I'll go and get Tom.
Are you feeling under the weather?
You're such a weirdo.
I pushed Tom into the water.
I've gone a long time without reading a book and I am ashamed.
Tom is overreacting.
Did the interview go well?
Are you sure you want to do it?
Do you eat rice every day?
I think Tom knows things that we don't.
I'm sorry I didn't reply to you sooner.
I love three-day weekends.
You are always welcome.
You ought not to stay up so late.
Tom felt that there was no need to hurry.
He has to stay in bed.
I didn't want to humiliate Tom.
Do you not know who I am?
My neighbor called the police.
What do you call this?
I'm the only one who stayed awake all night.
I don't know how old Tom is.
Tom is in the garden.
I do not feel like doing it.
I can't drink milk.
Is there anyone we invited who hasn't come yet?
I didn't understand you.
I admire their ingenuity.
My favorite color is blue.
Let me help you with that.
He was arrested as an accessory to the robbery.
It has nothing to do with you.
How long have you been playing the violin?
We've run out of beer.
Could you please overlook it this time?
Tom got off the elevator and walked down the hall to his office.
You didn't answer the question.
I don't want to see you.
The mouse ran into the hole.
Vampires cannot cross the threshold of a house without having been invited.
I waited for a reply.
I slept through the storm.
Throw it to me.
I'm worried about the baby.
Look after the cat while I'm away.
Tom had to go himself.
"He may be clever, but he often makes careless mistakes."
I didn't go fishing with Tom last weekend.
Did you know that he bought a condominium?
They played table tennis together.
He felt something crawl up his leg.
Take off your mask.
The dictionary on the desk is mine.
Tom can't beat me.
Get Tom on the phone.
"All of a sudden, I remembered that I couldn't pay for so many books."
Do you usually have tea for breakfast?
Tom's singing.
Both of us began to smile almost at the same time.
I'm glad you came over.
The fire alarm rang.
I knew this was going to happen.
It concerns all the people living there.
The work calls for patience.
It is easy for us to speak Japanese.
Do you like your brother?
This is Tom's grave.
Tom has never told anyone what happened that night.
"If you run fast, you can catch the train."
I know who was in Tom's office at 2:30.
I don't like riding the subway.
Tom is very interested in water sports.
The boy I love doesn't love me.
How was Tom murdered?
Tom likes eating raw carrots.
Tom didn't mention what he'd done.
Why didn't you just ask?
We're just pretending.
I'll take it home with me.
I can't remember exactly who told me that.
Tom lost his hat.
This place hasn't changed much.
Tom didn't know how he should answer.
"If you have an indoor swimming pool, you're probably pretty rich."
Let Mary do her job.
Did you read the article?
That article makes fun of vegetarians.
Cats were sacred animals in ancient Egypt.
I am fan of football.
She was raised by her grandmother.
It doesn't concern you.
You're still taller than me.
I'm breaking in my new shoes.
This is not a hospital.
Tom had no idea what the woman was talking about.
I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
I will arrive in four hours.
We've always been good friends.
Tom is starving.
They don't want us.
What does this key unlock?
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.
Do I have to write a letter?
Tom can't seem to understand what Mary is trying to say.
You have to see it to believe it.
Hug Tom.
This isn't your decision.
"The policeman aimed his gun at Tom and yelled, ""Hold it right there!"""
I don't want to rest.
I don't know yet.
My favorite team lost yesterday.
Tom is one of our clients.
It was Tom's idea.
I have to stop doing this.
What did those two men want from you?
Should I cut the red wire or the green one?
You may borrow my car.
Tom is a bad driver.
Tom has made sure no one can get in.
You're being very unreasonable.
I got soaked to the skin.
I really hope so.

A clear conscience is the sure sign of a bad memory.
Give that to Tom.
Are you from the bank?
It's not without risks.

I'd like to spend some time with my daughter.
Is Tom prepared?
Tom doesn't know whether what Mary says is true or not.
I made him paint the house.
What made you want to become an anesthesiologist?
I heard you did well.
She went there yesterday.
Can you prove it?
Turn off the TV.
I had completely forgotten.
Our supplies are running out.
Tom wants to come.
"I love you, Tom."
Don't tell me to calm down.
He loves to gossip.
I'm OK with that.
"I'm sorry, but I already have plans for the evening."
I worked hard last month.
They've gone.
Tom needs to buy a gift for Mary.
Tom has no manners.
Don't chase after fame.
I haven't got a clue.
How do I get to Gate 5?
What're you going to do during your summer vacation?
I shouldn't have mentioned it to Tom.
I don't want a promotion.
Tom could be dead.
What's happened?
Where's the rest of it?
I wonder who the people I saw her with were.
This place gives me the creeps.
He is about your age.
Have you ever seen a purple butterfly?
There are about 500 cattle on the ranch.
It took me ten minutes to walk to the station.

Tom says that he'll be at the meeting tomorrow.
Did you break it?
"Tom, I want to talk to you."
He came back two days later.
"Tom scanned the list, but couldn't find his name."
I'm escaping.
This is sheer nonsense.
We need one more volunteer to go on a mission to rescue Tom.
What was that noise?
"Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried."
I'll miss you so much when you leave in June.
Something is the matter with my watch.
How many times do you have to go to the dentist?
How are we going to repair this?

He is not young.
You do look a little better today.

Do you believe in God?
You will pay for this.
"When did you find out about it? ""Find out about what?"""

I asked Tom what he was listening to and he surprised me by saying that he was listening to classical music.
Tom thinks the plan may backfire.
Is this your first visit to this town?
I usually get up at eight o'clock.
Tom didn't want to sit next to me.
He was foolish to agree to the plan.
This is a great theory.
I felt quite relieved after I had said all I wanted to say.
He is the son of a wealthy family.
No questions were asked.
I do think I understand.
Stop correcting me.
This isn't a diamond. It's just plain glass.
Tom realized that Mary was tired.
The nurse has taken my blood pressure.
Come to watch us play.
My grandmother went peacefully in the night.
We can't see each other again.
I don't care what anyone says. I think Tom is a nice guy.
I don't blame you for this.
I don't think we should go this way.
Mary and Tom value their privacy.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
Tom couldn't remember.
That's all I did.
I forgot that Tom didn't speak French.
I want it to be a surprise.
Tell me which you want.
Water has no calories.
He's a talented young director.
They watched intently.
The password you have entered is invalid.
Tom connected the TV to the antenna that the previous owner of his house had mounted on the roof.
Everyone wanted a piece of the cake.
Tom shouldn't have borrowed Mary's car.
I have another question.
You'd better come up with something fast.
Can you do it in one day?
I can't stand those kinds of people.
I don't want to be rude.
Today is our last day of school.
Tom solved the mystery.
I hope nobody got hurt.
I don't want to do that again.

Have a safe journey.
I'm meeting Tom for dinner. Do want to come?
Tom managed to pass the examination.
I do hope you'll come again.
Tom is in denial.
The building has exits on all sides.
He's sitting at the table.
Does that mean we're in trouble?
"This time, you've gone too far."
Tom doesn't care about his grades.
Is this your first visit here?
Everything changed.
Are you sure you're OK?
This song makes me cry every time I listen to it.
I feel good this morning.
It's a matter of national pride.
Thousands of foreigners visit Japan each year.
Are these yours?
The boys are noisy.
What is it with you and Tom?
It's a great way to make friends.
Why did your father beat you?
A heavy rain fell.
"A young boy, who couldn't have been more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office."
"So, how long have you known Tom?"
I will tell you about him.
I'm upstairs.
They wouldn't have done anything.

Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan.
This is my decision.
What's the matter with you? You look pale.

I drank coffee.
Don't worry about the result of your test.
Two hundred people died of cholera last year.
I have several silver coins.
Why is it so hot?
It is believed that ghosts exist in this forest.
Keep the windows open.

I'm a child.
Her house is two or three times as large as ours.
There is insufficient light for reading.
Why do I have to do this?
Did you show it to your parents?
What're you saying?
I assume you know who Tom is.
"You aren't going to tell my parents, are you?"
The zipper is stuck.
I think it'll rain today.
Do you have any more of these?
It's been ten years since my grandfather died.
I'll go next month.
She's made up her mind and refuses to be talked out of it.
You'd better do what I suggest.

Technology is in itself meaningless unless it serves mankind.
What happened last week?
"Mary has only ever had one other boyfriend, apart from Tom."
I bought this shirt yesterday.
Tom took out his cell phone so that he could take a selfie.
Do you have these shoes in my size?
He is better off than before.
"As soon as he comes back, let me know."
The army quelled the rebellion.
I'm thirty years old.
That's the worst joke I've ever heard.
There is one thing I don't understand.
I'm glad you're here today.
She had a bad tooth taken out.
Aren't you OK with this?
The kidnappers tied my hands behind my back.
I asked why Tom was late.
I'm an optimist.
I think that's what Tom wants.
You could learn a lot from them if you'd only listen.
"Tom was shy, but Mary wasn't."
We saw something white in the dark.
The official could not deal with the complaint himself.
She handed him the money that she owed him.
How many CDs do you have?
That was impressive.
The book is on the table.
The whole thing doesn't make sense.
Let's take a 10 minute break.
Tom is a Canadian citizen.
"If necessary, I'll come at nine tomorrow."
We advertise our products on TV.
You should obey the traffic rules.
Do you serve any sugar-free beverages?
"When it rains, she takes the bus."
They never did anything.
You were supposed to tell Tom that.
Playing with fire is dangerous.
We have no choice.
Tom was a little worried about Mary.
She thought of a good way to make money on the Internet.
I think life is what you make it.
He put on his undershirt inside out.
He was silly enough to believe her.
Tom says he's doing that.
Tom is still in bed.
You're my hero.
He came in spite of bad weather.
"He failed, due to lack of money."
You don't sound convinced.
This is an ice cube.
Tom wiped his hand on his pants.
I should've asked Tom first.
Mom remained in the car while Dad shopped.
Did you see the accident?
Are you as tired as I am?
"Tom is a student, isn't he?"
Do you disagree?
I have not eaten anything for the last three days.
I pinched myself to make sure that I wasn't dreaming.
He ripped the envelope open.
"Without your help, I would have drowned."
I'd like to see that.
I'm a chauffeur.
I did it for him.
Come over here and sit down.
Tom was killed in a hunting accident.
What you did was very brave.
It doesn't hurt.
Would you like to dance?
Tom unlocked his office door.
"You hardly ever work, do you?"
Tom will give you all the information you need.
A man like me needs a hat.
I'll take Tom home.
Tom told Mary that it wasn't a good idea to have money just sitting in the bank.
I strongly suggest that you get yourself another lawyer.
You aren't alone.
I don't know what to do and neither does anyone else.
You are the master of your own destiny.
How many digits does that number have?
You're in my seat.
Tom thought he had a chance to win the race.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
There are only three maids in this hotel.
May I ask you something?
I want to stay a few days.
Our trip lasted a long time.
He never saw his father again.
"I'd like an 80-yen stamp, please."
Don't talk in the classroom.
Why can't I go with you?
I rested in the shade of a tree.
This is no joke.
Nice to see you.
Don't you ever say anything?

I did nothing illegal.
I just want to be alone right now.
They are my friends.
Eliminating the deficit will be a very difficult job.
Tom lives in a small town where nobody locks their doors.
Tom opened the drawer to get a calculator.
Use them all.
Are you coming?
Tom will see Mary today.
"You should be frank, and they will treat you as a friend."
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will go bowling.
I'm very happy here.
I had no idea you were interested in Japanese art.
We can't let these flowers die. Please water them.
English is difficult to learn.
It's pitch black inside the cave.
Give me another beer.
It's a shame the way old people are treated.
I don't regret it at all.
I've said what I had to say.
"His name was on the tip of my tongue, but I couldn't remember it."
I eat breakfast every morning.
I asked Tom to play my favorite song.
Come on!
"It is often said that Japanese universities are difficult to enter, but easy to graduate from."
You're too trusting.
The baby weighed seven pounds at birth.
I have an old score to settle with Tom.
Tom brought his son to work.
I don't know what I believe.
It was black.
Does your wife know all this?
Tom denied having been there.
I wrote a long letter to her.
Tom is distressed.
What's wrong with you?
Tom drank from my cup.
He left Africa forever.
Tom nervously opened the door.
That can't be true.
A girl phoned me.
We've resolved the problem.
Tom isn't at home now.
Tom showed me a drawing he did of Mary.
We were all terrified.
I am in the habit of taking a shower in the morning.
I can't bear the thought of losing you.
"I now live in Boston in the US, but I plan to go back to Japan before the end of the year."
Tom repacked his suitcase.
Listen to this!
I'll have no choice.
We used to call him Tom.
Why did Tom buy that?
Thank you very much for all your support.
She's been working all day long.

I can't see without my glasses.
Tom thinks Mary knows.
I don't want to butt in all the time when the two of them are fighting.
You can't have this.

My mother was up late last night.
All you can do is trust one another.
Fish live in the water.
Something smells good. What are you cooking?
Ice is solid.
I asked him a question.
Take the next left.
How much of what I've written here do you understand?
Don't you want to stop Tom?
I let Tom drive my car.
This guy looks like a fox.
I hope everyone knows what this means.
Don't do that anymore.
He gave me a nice Christmas present.
The fog was thickening quickly.
"I should've said something before, but I was afraid you'd get angry."
Thanks for dropping by.
I could never be like you.
Tom never goes to school by bus.
Tom is now in jail.
I cut a branch from the tree.
I don't know where he comes from.
You're definitely prettier than Mary.
Finishing the job by Tuesday will be a piece of cake.
Tom told Mary how he and John met.
I want to apologize for last night.
Her husband is American.
You look very pale.
I don't know why I didn't think of that before.
There is a flower on the table.
You may choose what to eat from this list.
Tom is a war hero.
Do you want to tell me anything about Tom?
I visited Tom yesterday.

There's the bell.
The cats are purring.
I wanted to hire a coach.
How does Tom look?
Did you remember to buy candles?
Refugees poured in from all over the country.
"Over 100 tons of dust and sand-sized particles bombard the earth every day from space, most of which goes unnoticed."

This is where Tom lives.
I think that's what it is.
Do you have attacks of dizziness?

It was a lot more expensive than I thought it would be.

Would you like a cup of coffee?
Those two pieces fit together.
My bike has a flat tire.
I think I'll walk back.
What places would you like to visit?
You've done it!
This is impossible.
"I don't want to go, and besides it's too late."
Tom's computer made a strange noise and then went dead.
You can't put it off any longer.
That's why I like Tom.
I know you're hiding somewhere in this room.
"If I were you, I wouldn't live with him."
I received a letter in French last week.
Tom's house is at least twice as big as mine.
Tom has worked for me for three years.
She went upstairs.
The city hall is located at the center of the city.
She went to the hospital yesterday.
He made me a suit.
I'm traveling alone.
Tom should resign.
You can't stay for long.
Compare your translation with the one on the blackboard.
Tom has an airtight alibi.
A capital letter is used at the beginning of a sentence.
I'd appreciate any help you can give me.
Tom is downstairs right now talking with Mary.

Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
Do you want to go with Tom?
I think this is his umbrella.
It looks like today will be a long day.

You'll find out.
I can't remember how I got here.
It sounds simple.
Hurry up and you can still catch your train.
Tom knocked again.
I wasn't able to come because of the rain.
I hope I can be of some help to you.
Nobody is perfect.
Explain it to me.
It was your idea.
What Tom said is true.
Tom never showed up.
She likes him.
Tom can hold his breath for five minutes.
Tom was bitten by a bat.
"When I see him, I think of my grandfather."
How can I motivate myself?
Tom removed the lid from the box.
Do you see anybody?
Please wrap it up.
"I paid 2,000 yen for this atlas."
Tom is a good football player.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
He drew $100 from his account.
"Tom is a plumber, just like his father."
Are you planning to help Tom?
Tom plays the drums as well as the organ.
What don't you like about your job?
Do you know a good way to learn new words?
This was your idea.
Why couldn't you do that?
You were charming.
Tom ironed his clothes.
I'd be surprised if they asked me to give a speech.
I'll go and have a look.
Tom gave Mary a diamond bracelet for their wedding anniversary.
Are you telling me that you've never had a nightmare?
Miniskirts have gone out of fashion.

Do you have a moment?
Get me something to eat.
Could you lend me a hand?
Tom can play tennis very well.
What do you have in your suitcase?
You need to stop.
How long are you going to stay in Oxford?
My father has lived in Nagoya for 30 years.
Those dark clouds will probably bring rain.
We know something about it.
Where should we pitch our tent?
Please say hello to your parents for me.
You can't buy it anywhere but there.
Tom is asleep.
Those who know him speak well of him.
You should acquaint yourself with the local customs.
Let me see your ring.
I don't want to go jogging with you.
I have some friends in Australia.
I need to lose a few kilos.
Hurry up! The concert is starting.
Calm down.
I'm not happy about that.
It's not supposed to happen.
What are you watching?
I still think we should've told Tom to come.
He loves singing.
It's acceptable.
What time does the club open?
These scissors cut well.
I can't let that happen.
I know how important this is to you.
Get Tom's advice.
Just get out.
Does she come from the agency that sent the last temporary I had?
I will never be your friend.
I don't understand you people.
The church bell is ringing.
Don't stop.
This vase is fragile.
No one is home.
He has the advantage of a good education.
I'm going to get you.
Don't you have to go to school today?

Are you on Facebook?
You're very quiet today.
He was kept waiting for a long time.
The road was very bumpy.
You can't yell at Tom.
You're up early.
Tom is sleeping now.
It'll confuse him.
The surface of the object is fairly rough.
We have no idea how it happened.
Find Tom.
You look good without your glasses on.
That doesn't answer my question.
My umbrella protects me from the rain.
What am I going to do about Tom?
Tom hasn't been answering his phone.
I'm pretty sure that's Tom.
We're ready to go.
This is the best book I have ever read.
Tom won't be away for long.
I want to go to America.
That's what you get for not listening.
Where did you lose your umbrella?
I'm homeschooled.
She revealed the secret to him.
It was not a complete victory.
Tom appreciated the gift that Mary gave him.
He's relaxing at home.
You don't even know how.
Take a deep breath and relax.
Something's strange.
Tom acted like he didn't know me.
Nobody could explain how the thing was made.
That American movie was a great success.
Tom waved at Mary from the helicopter.
You did that on purpose.
Nobody's perfect.
"I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came."
Have you received an invitation from Tom?
He sent me a comic book from Germany.
Tom didn't accept my apology.
Tom seems fairly sure of himself.
Be creative.
Both teams are well matched. The game will be an interesting one.
"If I'm late, I'll be scolded."
Tom could see that Mary was crying.
Was that a squirrel?
How did you celebrate New Year's Eve?
I didn't have time to take a shower today.
"He said, ""I want to be a scientist."""
This is rather frightening.
It is necessary for you to help her.
Tom told me I shouldn't wear a pink shirt.
Where are you taking me?
They both like the same girl.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way.
My wife's part-time job brings in a little extra money.
The evening he died was stormy.
I've heard worse.
He drank a beer.
I think it's better not to try it.
Don't tell me you still trust Tom.
Your house is big.
How long do we stop here?
What are they doing in there?
"We got stuck in a traffic jam, which made us twenty minutes late."
There are only two primes between 10 and 14.
He likes to read books.
That's so sweet.
I took an arrow in the knee.
Is it Tuesday already?
Tom wanted to die.
Tom thought it over for several days.
I'm on my way.
You're a good cook.
I'll go to Kyoto.
His victory made him a hero.
I haven't yet had time to see about a hotel for the night.
I read the Times.
Did Tom make you cry?
That's cool.
My mother passed away recently.
I want to hear you say it.
Tom speaks loudly.
We've been over it three times already.
Dr. Stein will be with you shortly.
Those were the saddest hours of my life.
I don't know when he got back from France.
This statue is as large as life.
Who's up for some ice cream?
You would have failed without his help.
We have finished lunch.
"Hurry up, or you will miss the train."
What would I do without you?
All three of us are students.
Japan imports a large quantity of oil.
There used to be a lot of frogs in this pond.
"A few months later, Israel invaded Egypt."

My dog often pretends to be asleep.
Tom should be there by now.
Is there any appetizer?
I expect that Tom will do more.
My wisdom tooth hurts.
You've done more than enough.
Tom was obnoxious.
This is a complete waste of time.
I'm going to need some help.
That's what we all thought.
The ceremony will take place tomorrow.
Tom always flies economy class to save money.
I'll deal with it later.
No way!
Am I approved?
Tom was devastated when Mary broke up with him.
Don't be afraid.
I can't seem to do anything right.
Is that just a coincidence?
Throw the ball to Tom.
I have been in Japan for three years.
I had a physical checkup.
Have you tried restarting your computer?
Are we safe here?
"I know what time you said to be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time."
I want to go to America someday.
Tom said he regretted his decision.
Is there any milk left?
"In many restaurants in Turkey, kebab is the main entree."
Let's go somewhere quiet so we can talk.
Tom doesn't even read the newspaper.
This church dates from the 12th century.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
I'd rather not sing that song.
It looks like you're wrong.
How old is the Eiffel Tower?
I've never seen anybody die.
Can you describe to me the difference between black tea and green tea?
It's pitch black.
Their deep love for each other was unequivocal.
Do you want to end up like Tom?
It wouldn't do any good to complain about it now.
Are you joking?
"You've never been to Europe, have you?"
We've won!
Tom didn't want Mary to go out with John.
I almost dropped a plate.
That child caused a lot of trouble.
I think it's still too early to celebrate.
The plane should have arrived at Kansai Airport by now.
I need a place to stay for a couple of days.
Tom put too much sugar in my coffee.
Let's try once again.
People listen to Tom.
I'm not disappointed whatsoever.
We will accept your conditions.
She postponed her trip to Mexico.
Mary's hair is blowing in the wind.
Tom frequently wears a hat.
Can you forgive me?
This is an unexpected surprise.
I've told you everything I remember.
Classes are starting again soon.
"In 1979, Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize."
Did Tom yell at you?
I don't like telling him the truth.
Tom became nervous.
You shouldn't count on others for help.
I don't want to go out with Tom.
What don't you like?
Don't you miss me?
Your daughters are beautiful.
He lived alone in the forest.
I can't drive Tom to school today.
The sound is coming from inside the house.
"Helen Keller was blind, deaf and dumb."
I've been to Sapporo before.
I should not have said that.
I'm from the FBI.
I want to know what's going on out here.
Just do what Tom says.
Don't make a sound.
We know about Tom.
He came home at ten.
I came to tell you not to worry.
I want you to take these.
That's what we do best.
You should take it easy.
I was compelled to go there.
The matter is of great importance.
You were right to worry.
Tom was seen stealing apples from the neighbor's tree.
"We can forgive, but forgetting is impossible."
"Tom has a beard just like his father, grandfathers and brothers do."
Please take a look at this picture.
Please sit here.
My idea is different from yours.
Try not to forget anything.
What advice did Tom give you?
"As soon as he arrived in the capital, he got settled at a hotel."
Get over here and be quick about it!
Have you ever seen a bear in this area?
Japan has a lot of beautiful mountains.
We're out of tea.
Tom never drinks coffee this late in the day.
They did what had to be done.
This might be over soon.
Tom works in the film industry.
The prices will come down.
Please choose a stronger password.
Tom was already drunk.
I want you to get off my back.
Tom wants to marry Mary.
Math is hard.
A rainbow is a natural phenomenon.
Where did you get that scar?
You were never very good at math.
Did you guys hear what Tom said on TV?
Tom and Mary were the last two to leave.
Why aren't they here?
Lock the door.
The new film was a great success.
The whole group is laughing.
He pricked up his ears.
We will never agree.
Never rely too much upon others.
Tom will use force.
Somebody tried to kill Tom.
You can tell Tom not to worry.
The world is changing fast.
I can lend you some money if you need some.
I suggested that we bring the meeting to an end.
That door won't open.
A growing child who doesn't seem to have much energy perhaps needs medical attention.
Nothing is more important than health.
Why did you agree to do it?
Maybe you should take your own advice.
They're ignoring us.
Why do you take that medicine?
You look contented.
I'll watch it.
Tom hasn't yet decided what to do.
Mary is mine.
I think Tom should go.
The question was too difficult to answer.
Do you have kids?
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
I have a lot of things to do this morning.
Tom parked the car across from Mary's house.
Tom was quite courageous.
There's something wrong with me.
They say Tom's brain isn't functioning anymore.
You must get the job done before the deadline.
I'll read it.
We happened to meet at the station.
I shouldn't have told you this.
Tom lost his new watch.
It's already time to go to sleep.
I searched all over for Tom.
We haven't been able to find out much else.
I could not accept that my wife was really dead.
Go jump in the lake.
"That's a job of your own choosing, isn't it?"
Tom accumulated a large fortune.
What were you and Tom arguing about?
The house collapsed in an earthquake.
I've got a lot of work to do today.
You hardly ate anything.
Tom wants to be famous.
Wait here. I'll return shortly.
Tom asked his boss for a raise.
How long do you have?
I want you all to stay with me.
Everyone knows the law.
You have got a lot of nerve.
Heating water is expensive.
What is that supposed to mean?
How did you stain your dress?
Tom tried to pry open the window with a screwdriver.
I'm not so sure.
I was at a loss for words.
I'd like to spend more time with my family.
There is a car in front of the building.
I'm dying.
Tom must be a good teacher. All of his students seem to like him.
I've become smarter.
"By the time we got there, the ship had left."
Tom pointed to each word as he read it.
I'm going to jump.
The story ends with his death.
This makes no sense.
Tom came to all three of my weddings.
He's nervous and gets scared easily.
That boy watches over the sheep.
She repeated her name slowly.
"If I can do it, so can you."
Someone is looking at me.
Tom took Mary in his arms and kissed her.
It's time you went to bed.
He was scolded by his mother.
The neighbors' son won the spelling bee at school.
The waiter was insolent.
He was the one who suggested it.
We want to break off this negotiation.
It really gets on my nerves.
Have a nice trip!
Why are you still here?
Don't interrupt our conversation.
Tom's a natural when it comes to games involving hand-eye coordination.
Am I annoying you?
What results do you anticipate?
I never would have thought that I would meet you here.
I want you all to be on your best behavior.
I don't like this one.
What is the exchange rate?
Thank you for your trouble.
What made it difficult for you to carry out the plan?
It's very difficult to communicate with people from other cultures.
He didn't drink the milk.
He has a big restaurant near the lake.
He banged his head.
The doctor advised Tom to have at least three alcohol-free days per week.
She cried all night.
The opera singer has a beautiful voice.
"In an emergency, do you act quickly?"
I paid good money for this.
We may as well start at once.
Do not oversleep tomorrow morning.
She cannot control her children.
They abandoned the sinking ship.
"When your friends begin to flatter you on how young you look, it's a sure sign you're getting old."
I'll never forget him as long as I live.
Tom will get off scot free.
Two from ten leaves eight.
"Suddenly, something unexpected happened."
Today isn't really convenient for me.
I hope no one sees us.
Don't tell anyone I was here.
That seems suspicious to me.
Have you finished your work?
You did a splendid job.
Kyoto is visited by many people every year.
Tom is Mary's half-brother.
Tom raked up all the leaves.
I would've said no.
"Since it was raining, I took a taxi."
Do you like camomile tea?
Tom told everyone.
I apologize for Tom's behavior.
I know that you will forgive me.
I don't agree at all.
My passport was stolen.
Tom was out of breath.
They say we are going to have a severe winter.
The power's out.
Tom says he's rich.
Tom made fun of Mary behind her back.
Who saw you?
The loan bears an 8% interest.
The birds were hungry.
I hadn't thought of that.
A drowning man will catch at a straw.
Keep warm.
She pushed the door open.
Tom was unharmed.
Shaving doesn't make your beard grow faster.
Tom lowered his eyes.
I want to go to another country.
China is twenty times as large as Japan.
The children were sliding on the ice.
Remember that we have a meeting on October 20th at 2:30.
He left Tokyo for Kyoto.
I hope we will be able to keep in touch.
Let's ponder that for a moment.
"Actually, that's what I thought."
I love autumn.
Tom waited for Mary to sit and then sat down next to her.
He told me that you were right.
My mother is making a cake for my father.
My uncle has a farm in the village.
They have come.
I love this song.
We're reading.
He sounds disappointed.
Here is your change.
I plan to stay in Boston for three more days.
Did you get a haircut?
Getting lost is the least of my worries.
Country roads aren't as crowded as city roads.
Did Tom stay?
We had a very long talk.
I heard you did well.
That's sad.
I've always wanted to learn to cook like you.
How is that different from what I just said?
I said I wasn't ready.
Your friend from Boston dropped by to visit us this afternoon.
Let's not tell anybody until next Monday.
Tom left a large fortune to his son.
I was a prison warden for ten years.
Our world is only a small part of the universe.
I can't keep living the way I've been living.
I enjoyed watching the game.
I'm sure Tom was involved.
All is calm tonight.
I want to go to Boston.
Tom dressed well.
Does that answer satisfy you?
She did not promise to come here again.
They took the subway.
Would you like me to call a taxi?
Drink up your milk.
Tom had to go there alone.
I'm going to study English this afternoon.
This road leads to the station.
Tom offered to help Mary move.
I won't lie to you.
He told me that he was busy.
Have you eaten breakfast yet?
Please give me this book.
I didn't like my name when I was young.
I have a red bike.
You should consider the problem.
Tom is in the driver's seat.
Is he at home?
Do you know anybody who speaks five languages?
Don't you have any ambition?
Tom saw Mary approaching.
Take your hands off me.
What're you reading?
I said don't do that.
The strain of the last few days was beginning to tell.
Tom will take the bus.
We can't take a chance.
People sometimes compare death to sleep.
How much money did you win?
Do you believe in God?
We have nothing else.
Tom and Mary live in a house by the river.
I didn't know about it until I read the paper.
You know what I'm doing.
Tom made that himself.
Tom is available.
You may choose any of them.
The Indians were hungry.
We sang in loud voices.
What's it worth to you?
The Titanic hit an iceberg.
I have a throbbing headache.
I'll let you know.
She cried all night.
I'm from America.
Tom shooed the flies away.
She had a strange look on her face.
I wonder why she didn't tell him about it.
Tom had his secretary make three copies of the contract.
Don't forget your stuff.
Her friend is a singer.
She was afraid to catch a cold.
It's more fun than drinking coffee.
Tom is always joking.
I wish I could help you find a good job.
I'm better.
Do you think that fish can hear?
It happened between eight and ten.
Are you two OK?
Tom kissed Mary goodbye at the airport gate.
Do you really want to stay young forever?
Be careful not to drive on the wrong side of the road.
The bomb will explode in 10 seconds.
He is a genius.
When will you leave here?
Can you believe it? He's even lazier than me.
Tom likes to wear dark colors.
You must not give up hope.
You can't really expect to get better at French if you don't study.
I am joking.
I like cats more than dogs.
I've always loved you.
Something green and slimy was on the rock.
Does it bother you if I smoke?
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
They're just students.
I don't think Tom tried hard enough.
I thought you wanted to wait.
I'll not make that mistake again.
Tom and Mary were too tired to argue with each other.
Tom doesn't trust a thing Mary says.
Somebody tried to kill Tom.
I really appreciated it.
I'd like to report a theft.
Make yourself comfortable.
What would we do without you?
Take Tom with you.
He speaks English fairly well.
May the new year bring you happiness!
Everything was fine until Tom started drinking.
Please show me what to do next.
Tom is driving a rental car.
I like to read before I go to bed.
You should arrive at school before eight.
I don't think I can get along with him.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind doing that.
I've made up my mind.
Tom got depressed.
"If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money?"
We won't be here much longer.
Did you get in touch with Tom?
"You are sure to succeed, whatever you do."
Do you prefer Coke or Pepsi?
It's a room large enough for a library.
I think I'll walk to school today.
Mario is an Italian citizen.
What's your favorite way to relax?
Tom is remorseful.
"I don't believe in astrology, but that doesn't mean that I don't read my horoscope."
Do you go to school?
All right. Please order it.
Let Tom go home.
"A week from today, I'll be in England."
I think we have to make a decision.
Tom told me that you've been to Boston before.
Are you sure you don't want to take a break?
I've decided what to cook for dinner.
Where have you been? We were just about to call the police.
Tom had to do that even though he didn't want to.
Tom watched the news every day last week.
I wish I had seen her.
Tom wants Mary to say yes.
You must decide whether you will go by train or by plane.
I think we're fine.
That's not my thing.
Do you expect me to believe you?
I hope you enjoyed your stay with us.
Tom has three uncles.
That's why Tom got up early.
That's for suckers.
I'm fascinated by cats.
It's difficult to make up for lost time.
They cut a hole in the ice and swam in the freezing water.
Spending time with your significant other should be high on your priority list.
I'll be present.
Where can I put my bag?
I didn't do anything special.
Last night's concert was disappointing.
"We need action, not words."
He's very good at playing baseball.
Everyone laughed at him.
Tom doesn't know what to believe.
It isn't obvious.
Tom is incredibly good-looking.
It was stupid of me to make such a mistake.
I've got a class in a few minutes.
Come get me.
Cut it in half.
I never was shy.
I don't have any feelings for Tom.
Tom always seems to be smiling.
She retaliated against him by ignoring him.
Please wait for me at the station.
One can't survive without money.
Mary is scantily clad.
Tom ran for his life.
They were fearless.
If we go this way we'll catch up with them.
I only want the money you owe me.
You're looking down.
He learned it the hard way.
You need not have come so early.
I don't shampoo my hair in the morning.
Tom doesn't know what to do with all his money.
Why aren't you going?
"A man's body dies, but his soul is immortal."
Tom is an extremely charming guy.
He denied having been involved in the affair.
Tom checked the oil.
Tom was the one who introduced Mary to me.
I appreciate all the help I can get.
Don't forget to brush your teeth before going to bed.
Maybe you shouldn't be doing that.
Tom was heroic.
The poor man has no relatives.
It was a real challenge for us to go down the cliff on a rope.
I'll fix you some coffee.
It was nowhere to be seen.
We have to conclude that the policy is a failure.
My home is separated from his by a river.
Tom said he intends to keep his old car.
"Are you sad? ""No. Why would I be?"""

I can't wake Tom up no matter how hard I try.
I've been very hungry since this morning.
We are at school together.
Were you busy yesterday?
"Water, in its natural state, is a fluid."
You had better get up early.
The building was totally destroyed by the earthquake.
My guess is that it will rain soon.
He wants to work in a hospital.
The whole country is talking about it.
He sold his business and retired.
I turned off the radio.
I saw Tom. He was with another woman.
Yours is over there.
That's why I left Boston.
I don't even know who has stolen what.
When exactly did you see Tom?
He's good at cards.
Why didn't you wake me?
Tom put the book on the table.
Tom didn't turn around.
I'm easily influenced.
We have a lot of snow at this time of the year.
He found a nice apartment for Mary.
Just keep your promise.
You're decisive.
I have something personal to discuss with Tom.
Please have a seat.
Tom is my stepdad.
What would the world be without women?
Tom tends to be late for appointments.
They exchanged greetings.
I'd prefer not to answer.
Tom is sharp.
"Thanks. ""You're welcome."""
That's up to Tom.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
I want to become an astronaut.
Keep your eyes peeled!
It's pretty overwhelming.
You've got willpower.
Don't you like that?
There are a lot of people in the park.
The exams are finally over.
Tom said he'd look at it.
Remember to mail this letter.
Tom doesn't like this.
Tom is my teacher.
His house was small and old.
Tom came to our house uninvited.
What color is your hair?
I read the label.
Tom always seems to be in a big hurry.
Today is the twentieth of October.
My phone's stopped working.
She saw him break the window.
I made this for Tom.
I have no intention of resigning.
He denied having said such a thing.
You don't waste time.
I'm waiting for someone.
Tom gave me a present.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
You are what you eat.
Where did you find my umbrella?
Can I have this box carried upstairs?
No one can understand your letter.
I'm looking for books on Roman history.
She has plenty of books.
He was strict with his children.
Tom sprinkled some sugar on the toast.
His letter indirectly refers to the matter.
"If you don't understand, you need to say so."
That guitar never sounded so good when I played it.
You should've told me Tom wasn't planning to go with us.
I feel strange today and I don't understand why.
The train was more crowded than usual.
Why are you speaking French to Tom?
It is truly a nice day today.
Tom took the ring off his finger.
Germans have been warned not to eat cucumbers.
Tom assumed Mary wouldn't be at the party.
Tokyo surrendered within days.
May I ask you a favor?
Does Tom really want to be left alone?
I don't want to write with this pen.
Gas was escaping from a crack in the pipe.
The ocean was calm.
I think it's time for me to go to bed.
Stop being so emotional.
Tom shouldn't have even been there.
I watched the baseball game last night.
Tom deserves to know what happened.
Did I fall asleep?
A good idea came into my mind.
Tom is unbeatable at chess.
Tom knows that he can win.
Is that why you called?
Thanks for your help.
He demands immediate payment.
Do you think it will fit here?
I worked as a piano tuner for many years.
I know you can do this.
Come help me.
Tom seemed calm.
I'm going to go shopping after lunch.
"You won, fair and square."
I have trouble seeing the blackboard from the seat the teacher assigned to me.
She had a good time talking with him.
We didn't complain.
Just stay away from my daughter.
I know where to find water.
Is there some sort of catch?
I have some wonderful news for you.
We were stuck for hours in a traffic jam.
That's good advice.
Don't laugh at my failure.
"In other words, he betrayed us."
Who would have thought back then that Tom had only seven years to live?
Tom is looking for his keys.
He's doing it right.
There's no way out.
There's not much traffic on this road after 8:00 p.m.
She came hurrying to his bedside.
He had fifty dollars.
"What do you do here, Tom?"
They're armed.
He wrote a book about China.
Tom didn't expect to hear back from Mary so soon.
I have to return this book to the library today.
It's a dictionary.
It was the general opinion.
I couldn't speak.
He visited France three times.
I want you to go see a doctor.
Tom said he wouldn't shoot an unarmed man.
Tom is easy-going.
You should have more faith in yourself.
Are you going to help us?
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
This apple tastes sour.
How can I extract the audio from a video clip?
We'll start tomorrow morning.
I think you knew my father.
Tom and Mary are still just kids.
I hope you're right.
What grade are you in?
There's a no-smoking sign inside the restaurant.
"Go on Tom, drink it."
Tom wanted to impress his friends.
Tom got in his car and drove away.
Tom is courageous and fearless.
You should have introduced yourself.
I'll be back soon.
Tom walked inside.
The Birth of Venus is a famous painting by Botticelli.
They're rich.
They live downstairs.
You're better off without me.
Maybe you don't want to remember.
It was built more than 500 years ago.
Try not to make the same mistake twice.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is going to do.
She is living hand-to-mouth.
Tom peeled the potatoes.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was there.
I was in Boston for almost the whole summer.
Tom is one of nicest guys I know.
I hate coffee.
She could not bear the sight of the mean man.
Tom is in the bathroom.
Everything appears to be going well.
Please let me tell you a little bit about this position.
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
He tried to kill himself.
I don't want to work there anymore.
The girls were crying.
It will serve you right if she never speaks to you again.
I think we shouldn't tell Tom what really happened.
Tom is worried about your safety.
He's incredibly talented.
What a loser!
She's wearing a hat.
He does not have any relatives at all.
Tom looks like John.
I learned it from him.
Almost sixty-nine million people voted.
Do you believe him?
The movie was interesting.
You can find somebody else to help you.
I was your age once.
There are no pens on the desk.
I am not allergic to penicillin.
You're in grave danger.
A lot of back problems can be attributed to poor sitting posture.
Tom knows why Mary did that.
I woke up thirsty.
He urged us to obey the rule.
"If something's happened to him, I'd like to know."
Horses sleep standing up.
Watch your fingers!
We slept in the same bed.
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
I sat down on the sofa next to Tom.
She hung up in silence.
I'll stay a few more days.
Promise me you won't go.
We'd better get ready early because the train won't wait.
Let's walk to the bookstore.
"You aren't afraid of heights, are you?"
I wonder if this is love.
She laughed so hard she cried.
"If you have something to say to me, say it."
Would you like anything else?
Wow! What a big box!
I am aware of the fact.
She called for help.
I exchanged yen for dollars.
The only thing Tom ever wanted to do was watch TV.
Tom is not very good at French.
She wore a red blouse.
Do you have a school uniform?
Do you watch TV every day?
Have you seen it?
Why didn't you ever tell us?
We didn't know each other at the time.
I don't care what he does.
I'm sorry. That's really all I remember.
Children under three are admitted free of charge.
You must study hard.
We're unusual.
How are you feeling today?
More than 300 reindeer were killed by a lightning strike in Norway.
Tom likes what he does.
Tom realized there was no point in lying to Mary.
My father likes traveling by air.
I can't follow you.
Tom gave it back to Mary.
It won't be long before your dream comes true.
Tom wants me to give up.
Do you like living in Boston?
"You speak a bit too fast for me. Could you speak a bit more slowly, please?"
I doubt that our new boss will be any worse than the old one.
We've had this discussion before.
The police arrested the suspect.
Are you questioning my loyalty?
Can you think of anything that I could say to convince Tom to stay?
Tom asked Mary to sit down.
How much money do you have on you?
I bet you know who told me that.
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
Can you remember the first time you saw Tom?
We would die without air.
Tom probably likes Mary.
I've been looking for it everywhere.
Tom kissed Mary on the Ferris wheel.
It appears to me you are mistaken.
Who threw this stone through that window?
"I thought we had eaten everything in the house, but I found another box of crackers."
He sticks to his principles.
Is that radical enough for you?
What was your name before you changed it?
I don't feel like watching TV.
The new station building is under construction and will be completed soon.
We receive many telephone calls from abroad.
Even I can't believe that.
I want a divorce.
Are you paying together or separately?
The fog began to disappear around ten o'clock.
I'm the one who deserves to be promoted.
Tom has what Mary wants.
That's what I call smart.
"As soon as he finished his work, he went home."
He isn't my brother. He's my cousin.
Please take this parcel to the post office.
I'm a beginner.
Tom pulled the curtains open.
I have a feeling that we may win.
I was on a trip to India.
Tom and Mary are planning to vote for the same candidate.
I attended his funeral.
Do you want to be my friend?
This stopped Tom.
I'm sure we'd be able to do this if we had Tom's help.
Tom works the evening shift.
Tom looked sick.
Tom wasn't at school yesterday.
Two months have passed since he left for France.
Umbrellas sell well.
Does Tom want to go home?
I thought you said you didn't do that kind of thing.
I believe in friendship.
I thought that we had agreed not to talk about that anymore.
I looked for a job.
I speak French every day at work.
You can only come to China if you’ve got a visa.
I have no friends to help me.
Tom told Mary that he had feelings for her.
Tom hasn't been to Australia yet.
It's warm today.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Tom doesn't let Mary watch TV after 10:00 p.m.
"You could at least try to be a bit more polite, even though it's not like you."
I'm still shopping around.
We know it was you that killed Tom.
He has no chance of succeeding.
Tom and Mary both don't understand French at all.
He's a fast learner.
"The girl fainted, but she came to when we threw water on her face."
We are looking for somebody who can use a computer.
It's hard for me to put my thoughts into words.
They cut down many trees to build the boats.
After reading his books I feel I can construct a house.
You look great in this picture.
Tom needs to go shopping for his mother.
It's not even on the map.
We're with the CIA.
That's my suitcase.
"You're feeling very sleepy, aren't you?"
Tom can't sing.
They visited me occasionally.
"Where would you like to work? ""In Australia."""
She hired him as an interpreter.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
You two look like you're in love.
He sent a card to Mary.
I'm going to hit the hay.
He said that I shouldn't even be coming in today.
I wrote down his name so I wouldn't forget it.
I can't get Tom to slow down.
I'm a hopeless romantic.
He will be back soon.
They translated the text.
I'll give Tom another chance.
I hid myself under the bed.
He is old.
Tom was half-asleep.
That's not what you said last night.
I'm enjoying it.
The pirates buried their treasure in the ground.
I hadn't expected anyone to be home.
I'm not afraid to be criticized.
Do not oversleep tomorrow morning.
Tom isn't afraid of us.
What're you up to today?
You won't believe it.
I'm not going to be very happy.
Does she work in this city?
I have to change schools.
He managed to get there in time.
Were you home at ten?
Don't tell Tom what you've seen here.
Tom is acting strange.
You'll never guess what I saw this morning.
They are to be married in June.
What were you doing when I called this morning?
I have a question for you.
Does Tom like to swim?
Tom is going to be upset when he finds out that Mary forgot to pay the rent.
You might want to ask Tom to help you.
This is the best restaurant that I know.
She is upset.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
This building changed hands several times.
I got here as soon as I heard you needed me.
I'm waiting for my friend.
Tom never forgets to say thank you.
What's that got to do with you?
Tom wasn't feeling well.
This book isn't too bad.
Phoenix is the capital of Arizona.
We're experienced.
Let this smoky air out of the room and let some fresh air in.
It is sometimes hard to tell right from wrong.
A man is never more truthful than when he acknowledges himself a liar.
Tom is vain.
I value our friendship more than anything.
Tom will win.
He borrowed his friend's car for a few days.
I like watching disaster movies.
Tom told everyone that he was afraid to do that.
They can't possibly be that stupid.
We all have a lot to learn.
He is always happy.
Please wait here.
Everybody knows.
"Two tickets to San Diego, please."
Please speak to me in English.
How much credit card debt do you have?
I can teach you how to fight.
It's not going to end well.
I had a good night's sleep.
Did you do your homework by yourself?
Maybe Tom tried too hard.
Many people use ATMs to withdraw money.
I had a quarrel with him over money.
I didn't feel like celebrating.
There was a lot of snow last year.
He told everyone.
I remember hearing the story once.
Tom probably doesn't yet know how much time he'll have to do that.
He's very shy. He says he wants to see you.
My boss is twice as old as I am.
This house has a heated swimming pool.
They came in.
I thought Tom was ready.
I was unable to prevent this.
Can I eat this bread?
"You aren't afraid of heights, are you?"
Come along.
The cat scared me.
Please bring the master key.
"For more information, visit example.com."
I can't let them catch me.
This'll work.
Tom never tells me anything.
Don't talk about this to anyone.
I'm a bit nervous right now.
Tom didn't have the courage to say no.
I am playing a game with my sister.
You're after Tom.
We played a baseball game yesterday.
I did nothing out of the ordinary.
Is this ball yours or hers?
She looked as if she had seen a ghost.
The cat had a ribbon around its neck.
You can mix different foods in a blender.
What can I help you with?
I recognized Tom's car.
I don't eat as much meat as I used to.
How did you get Tom to do that for you?
This we can do.
Tom closed the curtains.
"Because of his age, my grandfather doesn't hear well."
This is very impressive.
I'm sorry about this.
"In retrospect, I should have treated her with more respect."
He had the courage to decline the offer.
You're the cook.
"In spite of the heavy rain, he visited his friend in hospital."
I had no idea you couldn't speak French.
I've been looking for you all day.
Tom is reckless.
What did you think when you actually met me for the first time?
Tom fainted on the school playground.
Tom says he was busy.
I just received a message that the meeting has been canceled.
I'll go and get the book tomorrow.
The meeting is ten days away.
Tom used to tell Mary stories about when he lived in Australia.
I will never have a daughter.
Tell me about your daily life.
Check this translation with the original.
Let's go talk to Tom.
What would you have done in my place?
"I was just talking to Tom. ""About what?"" ""About what Mary did."""
He graduated from high school this spring.
I keep a diary in French.
I'm not familiar with that subject.
Who told you I was Canadian?
You must read this book.
We shouldn't leave the matter unsettled.
He proposal was not acceptable.
Look around you and tell me what you see.
I have to go to the airport to meet my family.
When will you have the report ready?
You need to be more careful.
I want to see them again.
Tom sat down on the couch next to Mary.
Tom set about solving the problem in a systematic and determined way.
I can teach you a thing or two.
Tom is a good guitarist.
She looked at him and knew that he was angry.
Binge drinking is harmful for your health.
"It doesn't matter what I say, she always contradicts me."
He confessed that he had fallen in love with me.
Mom is playing tennis now.
Is anyone else going?
Tom has a big family.
Tom has a loud voice.
"It's kind of creepy in here, isn't it?"
I've asked everybody.
Are you talking to yourself again?
It might be a long time before you see me again.
What's your favorite type of restaurant to go to?
Tom seems lucky.
The water in this river is very clean.

Tom has a tendency to get a little worked up.
We estimate the damage at one thousand dollars.
What have you done?
They're very old friends.
"If at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
The coach gave me some advice.
I always speak French with Tom.
They supplied the villagers with food.
My family goes to Italy every year.
"That's kind of you, Tom."
It wasn't hard to understand.
They crossed over the bridge.
Tom didn't do anything to deserve this.
She always boasts of her luck.
He left the room.
She can speak French and she speaks it fluently.
Tom is very curious.
I thought Tom would meet Mary.
No one ever saw such a thing.
Where does this book go?
Where did you and Tom first meet?
I think that Tom lied to me.
I'm sorry I said that.
I've missed you.
Did you vote in the last election?
Tom has a beer belly.
Could you wrap it up as a gift?
The girl was aware of the danger.
That blouse doesn't go with that skirt.
It's good to see you smile.
This watch is expensive.
You have to learn the basics first.
The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
She could not bear the sight of the mean man.
I prefer mineral water.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
That's the most beautiful gift I've ever received.
They carried out the captain's order to the letter.
I want some paper.
They got into the train.
Can you mail this letter for me?
Tom couldn't find a good place to hide.
It's a very tiring job.
I am learning Turkish.
I think you're going to like this movie.

This bridge is built of stone.
He has a very vivid imagination.
Which car is your father's?
It was Tom's fault.

His house is near a river.
It's for your own good.
Empty the car so we can use it.
Have you finished reading the book?

That's a woman's job.
Tom told Mary about his new car.
"You don't know German, do you?"
Do you feel like going to a concert?
"It is hard to define ""triangle."""
I haven't felt like this since I was a teenager.
Do you know where Tom and his friends went?
Do it tomorrow.
Are you able to solve it?
She gave him a present.
Tom asked Mary's father to buy him a ticket.
I talked with our sales people.
She is rather poor at tennis.
Tom usually stays at five-star hotels.
You'll get into trouble.
I can't make an exception.
My roommate is learning Chinese.
I figured you might want this.
I didn't know Tom was famous when we started dating.
I can't find the knife.
My head is spinning.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

These came for you.

It'll be there.

They are the ones who want to go.
My brother is a good skater.
All is well.
How did the fight start?
Tom has no idea what Mary is thinking.
I think Tom is intelligent.
Don't throw that away.
Tom was distressed.
There is a library in our city.
I'm glad to hear that she is unmarried.
The plan is worth considering.
Tom goes to school.
"Frankly speaking, he is untrustworthy."
Please come again.
Tom is still in police custody.
It's time to get some sleep.
What a great thought!
Tom's thirty.
He kept his word.
This bread smells really good.
Let's take a train.
There's no reason to complain.
You must forgive me.
Tom wasn't the first person to ask me that question.
We are calling the police.
Tom has been doing that for a number of years.
Tom's head was smashed in with a crowbar or something similar.
I don't think we were followed.
The new method was anything but ideal.
Tokyo is a very big city.

Everybody laughed at the boy.
"If I could have spoken French better, I might have gotten that job."
I'd like to see that movie.

My aunt inherited the huge estate.
How does Tom know that?
I've been waiting here for three hours.
We adopted a child.
Could you give me a ball-park figure?
I'd like to go to the seaside with you.
You ought not to say such things in public.
What are you going to do about this?
Are you busy now?
You can't prove that.
The communist forces quickly defeated the Marines.
I've told you that a hundred times.
Tom and I'll be on the same plane.
It's well worth the trouble.
Tom isn't playing by the rules.
Tom attempted suicide.
Tom can't deny this.
Where is my watch?
I may be able to help you.
I know I'm right.
There's a leak in the roof.
That's what I told them.
Forget about her.
Tom goes to the same school as Mary does.

Don't worry about the past.

I didn't want to be here in the first place.
Don't go yet.
Tom isn't as old as he looks.
Should I go to college?

Tom has known Mary since childhood.
That's not possible.
May I help you find something?
"You're right, of course."
I thought you were going to ask us to leave.

Are you students at this school?
Where is the captain of this ship?
Tom ran.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
Go and look for Tom.

They want it back.
Tom and Mary played catch for a while.
I didn't know that you used to work here.
Tom hasn't had a pay raise for three years.
"Under the new law, husbands can take days off to care for their children."
Tom wasn't quiet.
Mary is pregnant with twins.
The old man sometimes talks to himself.
It's important to read a lot of books.
I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you.
Is your uncle still abroad?
Tom has decided to have the surgery.
I want to get that classic car no matter how expensive it is.
"How are you feeling? ""Better."""
Does that frighten you?
I heard her sing a song.
I was convinced that he was guilty.
Tom's cheerful.
Take your shot.
Tom hit me.
I don't want to marry Tom.
Take this chair back to the meeting room.
I found your slippers under the bed.
Give him my regards.
We're leaving the day after tomorrow.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
"If I were you, I'd go home right away."
You're the expert.
How far is it from here to the museum?
I wish you had been there.

I burned my fingers on a hot iron.

We haven't made a decision yet.
Tom will starve.
The cops are looking for the gang's hideout.
I've got to go back to Boston tomorrow.
I've never seen Tom so disappointed.
Tom had his palm read.
I read a few books last week.
I like studying English.
What's wrong with me?
I don't envy you.
I made a thermos full of coffee so you can take it along with your lunch.
"I made a deposit of $1,000 at the bank."
Tom saw Mary standing in the crowd.
He seldom comes to see me.
I want to watch what's on TV right now.
Shouldn't we ask Tom first?
Tom has done that.
You have to go to the party.
I'm going to see Tom again.
Tom's idiosyncrasies take a bit of getting used to.
I looked everywhere.
What are we going to do about this?
"A long time ago when I was young, I used to write in my diary every day."
My favorite subjects in high school were geometry and history.
They're brothers.
You'd love Tom.
I don't have the authority.
You'll be fine.
Dolphins are very intelligent animals.
The front windshield of a car was smashed to pieces.
Do I have to wear a tie at work?
The temperature fell.
I should've reacted differently.
The cushions on the sofa don't match those on the armchairs.
The room is quite small.
I'm very glad I got to know you.
Tom isn't going to like that.
Tom definitely doesn't want to be class president.
How long can a person live without water?
Why do you suspect it was Tom who did that?
Tom was murdered.
I didn't know what was happening.
"Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you."
I want something to drink.
You may come in now.
Human beings are social creatures.
Would somebody please tell me what's going on?
Tom had a hectic week.
I'm not sure he wants to talk to me.
Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Is this the book you're looking for?
Please come here soon if you don't mind.
The weather outlook for tomorrow is not good.
Tom won't be able to finish the job unless we help him.
Don't look back.
It's only just the beginning.
That's an old joke.
The conference was not a complete success.
Tom cut the apple in half with his knife.
Are you sure you didn't do anything?
She got kicked upstairs to an executive position.
Tom is boring.
I'll buy a new one.
Tom doesn't know how long the party is going to last.
All plants need water and light.
I feel very sick.
The hour hand is broken.
Tom saved a seat for me.
"For the first time in more than 6 years, the unemployment rate is below 6%."
Long skirts are very much in fashion.
Take as many peaches as you like.
Please advise me of the cost.
Do you know whose this is?
You must on no condition open the box.
The enemy attacked from behind.
There's only one egg left in the refrigerator.
There's no proof.
That house is big.
That's what I'm saying.
I looked in the window.
I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider the possibility that there's another explanation.
Did she come here to relax?
Tom told Mary his age.
Do not do that.
That was pretty scary.
Tom was afraid that the typhoon would damage his house.
I have put on two kilograms this summer.
Both of my parents are still living.
"If I had time, I would study French."
Are these your own books?
It's getting hot in here.
He is the last person I would want to go skiing with.
The old man sometimes talks to himself.
I have something important to report.
"Do you want to buy it? ""Yes."""
Are you drinking enough water?
How much time do you spend shaving every day?
Tom told me that he wasn't afraid of ghosts.
What is your favorite color?
He kindly drove me to the station.
You didn't let me answer.
The movie's about to start.
He runs very fast.
My bike was stolen last week.
Do you remember who I am?
Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
Were you a friend of Tom's?
I knew where to go.
I just want to be happy.
Can't you leave me alone?
Tom only wears a suit on special occasions.
How tragic!
Women were given the right to vote.
It didn't surprise me at all that Tom got arrested from drunken driving.
Life's not fair.
The bus leaves in about two minutes.
A trip to America is out of the question.
Tom got used to working with Mary.
Tom is making vacation plans now.
"Come on, I'll show you."
We thought you knew.
What do we know about Tom?
Tom is dependable.
Tom spent a few years in prison.
Tom is a dwarf.
"Tom isn't very happy, is he?"
She gave her entire life to the study of physics.
They seemed to be discussing a matter of great importance.
I have known her since she was a little girl.
Tom has a limp.
She talks about Paris as if she had been there many times.
Mary and the other women left thirty minutes ago.
Tom hid the money in his underwear drawer.
You don't look sick.
I've got a plan.
Could you give me a few more minutes?
Tom explained the whole thing to Mary.
Maybe it's true.
Tom never listens to the teacher.
Come fishing with me.
The girl kindly told me the way to the museum.
It's just your imagination.
What does he plan to do?
My father was late for work this morning because of a traffic jam.
We're going to try to be there on time.
We got our roof damaged by the typhoon.
Go back to your room.
Would you please lower your voice?
I gave him what little information I had.
A blood vessel burst inside his brain.
I always try to make sure that everyone feels welcome.
You'll be safe with him.
Don't you remember anything?
There is a dog on the bridge.
What was the nature of the relationship between Tom and Mary?
We can't stop now.
He lived there completely alone.
He hid behind the black car.
I wrote a letter to my teacher.
The river flows under the bridge.
Aren't you glad you're retired?
The lady wearing sunglasses seemed very strange.
I had no idea you could dance.
The exact opposite is true.
One does not wear a red mini skirt to a funeral.
Tom's finished.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
I need to check on something.
Tom was kidding.
This coffee tastes really good.
He didn't do any work.
Do not tempt me.
Lock the door!
"While there's life, there's hope."
They still haven't woken up.
What makes you so sure Tom was the one who stole your bicycle?
I'll work alone.
The criminal was arrested.
What makes us human?
Tom went with Mary to Boston.
Tom postponed his trip to Boston.
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with her.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
Tom said he didn't feel like talking to Mary.
I know how difficult this must be for you.
"Tom loves Mary, but the feeling is not mutual."
Tom became sleepy.
Tom doesn't know Mary well enough to ask her to do that.
It makes all the difference.
I've got my own problems.
I'll expect you tomorrow unless you let me know otherwise.
We're doing great.
I can't stand this kind of music.
Tom didn't mention Mary at all.
The smallest continent is Australia.
Those roses aren't as beautiful as these.
It was not until few days later that the news arrived.
I'll stay at home with my grandparents this weekend.
Was that Tom who was playing the organ at church last Sunday?
I want to learn how to play the harp.
Don't talk about it in front of him.
Have you ever seen Tom do that before?
Please take good care of yourself.
I ran home.
How did you learn that Tom was living in Boston?
Where do you stay when you're in Boston?
My mother made me a sweater.
It's a pity that you can't come.
Do I have to leave a deposit?
Tom got hurt in the game last week.
You should take my advice.
Tom turned to Mary for advice.
Puzzles are fun.
I'll try to say it in French.
Why didn't you call?
I'll buy this.
You think that I'm wasting my time with him.
Where is his family?
The worst is over.
"This tie goes well with the suit, I guess."
Let's drop the subject.
Tom found out our secret.
This doesn't involve you.
I don't care where we eat dinner. It's entirely up to you.
"I appreciate the offer, but I can't accept."
Have you met the new family on the block?
Was that the problem?
You may see Tom there.
Check Tom's pulse.
"I have a new boyfriend, but my ex-boyfriend doesn't know about it yet."
What's it look like?
This book is unique in many ways.
"Lonely people tend to be afraid of meeting others, which ensures they will always be lonely."
Tom knew Mary wasn't a criminal.
I don't want to talk about it now.
I am supposed to babysit the children tonight.
Every crime must be punished.
It is doubtful whether he will accept my proposal or not.
I had breakfast at 7:30.
Tom is making cookies.
There is no fool like an old fool.
"To me, it is important."
Many health specialists say that you should eat three meals a day.
Boston has many beautiful parks.
How do you spell your last name?
We must help each other.
I'll see Tom.
See you next week!
She is in the bathroom.
I can't believe I'm agreeing with you.
I suspect that Tom is in love with Mary.
Tom apologized profusely.
We don't want Tom to do that anymore.
"I'm with you 100%, Tom."
Remember what happened last year.
How late is it?
I'm afraid I have no choice.
We don't want to scare the children away.
Tom seems to be unwilling to correct his mistakes.
Tom is a prisoner.
We couldn't agree on anything.
Tom was seated at a table by the sidewalk.
"If he is proficient in English, I'll employ him."
Tom pulled something out of his pocket and put it on his desk.
Tom won't be able to do that that soon.
Tom is somewhere here in the park.
What is he so angry about?
There are a lot of people and cars in this city. It is a busy city.
"Tom is at his desk, studying French."
I asked Tom to come.
The cold weather lasted for three weeks.
Do you want to be a flower girl?
He has a few friends.
You're in big trouble.
Are you all alone?
I can't figure out why she didn't come.
Do people still actually use that word?
My grandfather was a miller.
Stop following me.
You should really get a haircut.
He's dead-tired.
I wanted my life to be more enjoyable.
Knead the dough.
I'm not that naive.
We have to stop it.
How long would it take to swim across the river?
Technology has given us immense power.
It was very cold this morning.
Tom earned some money by mowing lawns.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
We arrived at the museum after a ten-minute walk.
I should have tried out this electric shaver before buying it.
That is quite possible.
We must go to school.
Tom is dreaming.
Tom is wasting his time.
Tom will be watching television if you visit him now.
I'm staying at a hotel for the time being.
"If I do not get the item this week, I will make a complaint to PayPal."
This is the big one.
The newspaper is by your side.
Do you know where your children are?
Tom replied to Mary's email.
I hope to see you.
I can't control myself.
Haven't we met before?
You can't afford to be careless in this experiment.
I know exactly what you're thinking.
It's Wednesday.
I would like to show you my beautiful city.
Many people attended the meeting.
Do you even remember Tom?
Tom smells bad.
Please write down what I say.
I look forward to seeing you again soon.
Perhaps he knows this story.
We need more space.
"Silence can be misinterpreted, but never misquoted."
Tom's grandmother is quite feeble and needs help with her daily activities.
We survived.
The waves are high today.
I hope that was what you wanted.
How long have you been in here?
Tom has no right to say that.
Did you check this?
He ought to be ashamed of his ignorance.
I don't want to get anyone in trouble.
How deep?
Tom seems intoxicated.
I'd ask Tom.
Where do you buy vegetables?
Stick to the facts.
Tom definitely needs a shower.
Tom didn't need to paint the fence. They tore it down a week after he painted it.
There were more spectators than I had expected.
Why are people so mean to me?
You should've let us know you were coming.
I took sides with them in the argument.
Tom didn't just sprain his ankle. He broke three of his toes.
The heat kept me awake all night.
His mobile has been stolen.
Would you like a cup of tea now?
He's afraid of cats.
"Today, I have a lot of homework."
"The police caught Tom red-handed, breaking into a house in our neighborhood."
Tom was supposed to go to Boston last week.
This book isn't mine.
Do you guys think I'm fat?
Can you remember the time we visited Tom when he was still a teenager?
One of my bags is missing.
I sell clothing online.
I'm fed up with English.
Tom hates rats.
Remember to mail this letter.
He comes from Geneva.
"You already knew that, didn't you?"
Do you see what I see?
What should I bring?
Was it you that left the door open last night?
I'm looking for a sweater.
You don't need to thank me.
Tom is in the building.
We don't need to go to school tomorrow.
Tom began gasping.
Their opinions differ from mine.
Do you want me to help you wash the dishes?
We just have to work very hard.
Can I be honest with you?
He has begun to enjoy country life.
Tom introduced himself to Mary.
You're sure taking your time.
Tom isn't calling.
Don't judge Tom too harshly.
I knew you'd be happy here.
I can't even do that.
Who knows what you saw?
Please look after my cats while I'm away.
Would you please send me a catalogue by mail?
You're generous.
Roosters can crow but it's the hens who lay the eggs.
My room is just below.
Tom is coming for you.
What don't you like about your job?
How would you feel?
He had no memory of the accident.
Do you prefer for television shows to be subtitled or dubbed?
She isn't afraid of snakes.
That looks good.
Tom plays the violin very well.
Tom wasn't there either.
We're very sorry about that.
She has never been asked out on a date.
Tom still rides the bicycle that his parents gave him when he was thirteen years old.
Tom is quite the talker.
Tom hid in the bushes.
May I ask what that means?
The boy is thirsty.
Tom told everyone that he passed the exam.
What are you trying to do?
They complemented each other.
The mountain climbers reached the summit before dark.
Do you know the reason why she is so angry?
"Whose cards are these? ""They are Fahima's."""
I think Tom is correct.
You can use my desk if you want.
The meeting was almost over.
Could I help you?
You ought to trust me.
Drop your weapons!
She reserved a room.
I recall less and less of my childhood.
I'm getting tired of losing.
Come get it.
Tom got out of bed and quickly put on his clothes.
That isn't fair.
"At the first hint of trouble, Tom disappeared."
All you need to do is listen carefully.
Do you like facial hair on men?
You shouldn't go swimming after eating a big meal.
That child put his playthings away.
Tom found a very old coin in the garden.
"Are these yours, Tom?"
Tom's plan saved us a lot of money.
I wonder what became of Tom.
This is no time to argue.
He is wise enough not to do such a thing.
I want to have nothing to do with you.
I was wrong.
Tom took Mary to the homecoming dance.
The shower is broken.
Go to sleep.
There is no use in crying. No one will hear you.
Do you know this song?
This island has an ideal climate.
You surprised everybody.
The old man was hard of hearing.
The family wants to buy a house.
Tom will find Mary.
Don't act surprised.
I can be courteous.
He had ambition.
He did exactly what I told him to do.
I didn't know you were so good at French.
Tom has gone mad.
Do you like it in Boston?
Tom seems excited.
Which one do you prefer?
I have to set my watch back. It's very fast.
I go shopping almost every day.
That man looks vaguely familiar.
This is justified.
Tom shifted gears.
"Sing us a song, please."
"I am your friend, right?"
Tom is here for the same reason that I am.
Detroit is famous for its car industry.
Were you there when it happened?
Let's give it a try.
How long have you been waiting?
"You think you have to do that today, don't you?"
Do you agree with Tom's recommendations?
Tom has a room at the hotel near the river.
He abandoned his family.
You must go through with your plan.
Pull over here.
I don't write letters.
Tom told me that it was possible to rent a bicycle.
I will postpone my trip to Scotland until it is warmer.
He signed the check.
Tom asked me if I wanted to dance.
The train is arriving soon.
Why did you do that?
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You may ask any questions you wish.
Everyone called me Tom.
Let's get this over with as fast as we can.
There is no reason why you shouldn't do such a thing.
"In the evening, I walk with my dog."
The world is running out of oil.
Help me take this apart.
I hope you'll like it.
I'll walk with you as far as the supermarket.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
Did you notice any change?
Tom isn't going to say no.
How much time does the average teenager watch TV every day?
The engine doesn't work.
Was that your plan?
"In order to do that, you have to take risks."
"If it had not been for the storm, I would have arrived earlier."
You'll pay for this.
We'll move in.
I'm already busy.
Tom hardly ever asks questions.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
I went to the bank to take out money.
We decided to leave him alone for a while.
I have a large family to provide for.
I just want to find out what happened.
I am not acquainted with him.
Tom made me swear not to say anything.
Why do you want Tom?
I play the guitar in my spare time.
How many times have you done this?
He stopped talking.
What're you doing with my car?
Stop hitting your sister.
Tom did most of the decorating.
He doesn't seem to be heading for the town.
I know you hate school.
Do you know me?
This is a pencil.
The pen has run out of ink.
I don't like this neighborhood much.
I'm certain.
We hope that the truth comes to light.
Tom slept in the car.
Sugar is bad for your teeth.
I like to run.
Would you rather play tennis or golf?
Tom told me to leave the room immediately.
Tom said you lived in Boston.
Where can I meet Tom?
I didn't wash my hair.
"As far as I know, he is reliable."
Tom is fishing now.
Life begins when you're ready to live it.
She looks like a boy.
Orange juice gives me diarrhea.
Tom meets his girlfriend at this coffee shop every afternoon.
Which of those girls do you like?
You know where I'll be.
You're going to like working for me.
I think Tom likes doing that.
Did you go to Hawaii or Guam?
Please don't shoot.
I don't have the patience for this.
The truth is I told a lie.
What kind of music do you enjoy listening to?
You can keep it if you want.
There is an apple under the desk.
You have provided me with some very useful advice.
The mother laid her baby on the bed softly.
She painted the walls white.
Please knock on the door before you enter.
Where were you when Tom needed your help?
He is not so much a scholar as a TV personality.
How much time has passed?
I got my shoes wet.
Tom should eat.
We made waffles.
Tom loves you very much.
I don't study as much as Tom does.
I have a couple questions.
I go to church on Sunday.
Please don't take pictures here.
I don't know where it is.
Please don't forget to write the letter.
The rain turned into snow.
English is studied all over the world.
The soldier became a teacher.
"Will you let me use your telephone, please?"
Many dog owners only feed their dogs once a day.
Did Tom bite you?
Start now.
We are young.
The bike screeched to a stop.
When was the last time you did the dishes?
We may be too late.
Tom is probably going to be called as a witness.
Tom had a heart attack.
We had fun with it.
I'll tell Tom you're looking for him.
Who's after you?
He's young and healthy.
How do you view this matter?
Several soldiers were injured in the offensive.
Tom is hiding.
Tom didn't flinch.
Thank you for seeing me.
Tom knows that Mary didn't win.
Tom and Mary walked along the shoreline.
Tom knows what you did.
I'll take that as a yes.
We must pay attention to traffic signals.
The room is hot.
Mastering a foreign language involves a lot of patience.
Is eating meat morally wrong?
I saw the message.
Do you think Tom will be early?
Let's discuss the matter here.
Have you ever touched a dolphin?
Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
Mary bought a fake Gucci handbag.
It was very small.
Tom drives.
Whose bike is this?
Tom doesn't know where his umbrella is.
How would you like it if I hit you?
I saw a strange woman there.
I think things are going well.
Did Tom say what time he'd be here?
I often go swimming at the beach in the summer.
Tom gave us everything we needed.
I know where it is.
It's still too cold to wear shorts.
I'm the boss around here.
Who can tell what will happen in the future?
We came to see you.
You've got the wrong number.
He promised not to smoke.
Tom fled to Canada.
Who wants it?
Tom's a nice guy. Everyone likes him.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
I only wear a kimono about once a year.
It's all happening behind closed doors.
He knows how to ride a camel.
I'll go look.
Push the button.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom had a daughter?
"I didn't know how to do it, but I was willing to give it a try."
I'll see what Tom thinks.
He couldn't stand the bitterness of the coffee.
You should look up that word.
Tom and Mary want to know what's going on.
You should wash your hands before you eat.
Do you know how old I am?
"Tom had to forgo his morning swim, on account of it being too cold."
I have two sons and two daughters.
Light travels much faster than sound.
I've learned from the best.
"Who kissed Tom first, Mary or Alice?"
The door remained closed.
He apologized to the employee.
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
Oranges are sweeter than lemons.
I rode in a hot air balloon.
"If you're so demanding of others, you should also be demanding of yourself."
What's the big idea?
Tom didn't feel much like eating.
I can't bear living alone.
She abandoned her children.
Where is the toilet?
Her father is a policeman.
Let's look at the problem from a different point of view.
I'm Tom's driver.
"If Tom can do it, I'm sure I can do it, too."
Do you want to have some coffee?
Would you mind if I asked you something?
This machine is superior in quality to that one.
Our team is five points ahead.
Tom felt fine.
They're lying to us.
I knew Tom didn't do that.
Tom and Mary are hanging out by the pool.
Are you seriously thinking about divorce?
You're innocent.
Is this your sack or hers?
We looked for her.
Go away.
We know for a fact it didn't happen that way.
That doesn't change anything.
You're not a suspect.
Tom likes to hunt.
He drove down to the hotel.
That's a very complicated question.
Does Tom know how to cook?
Steam trains were replaced by electric trains.
Mary has nothing to hide.
The accused told the judge that he was innocent.
That's not how Tom sees it.
I'll probably be back in Boston a couple of times next year.
It's already almost ten p.m. It's time for bed.
Tom is cool.
Some things just don't matter.
He'll be in London about this time tomorrow.
Let us know when you find out anything.
I'm not tired yet.
"In South America, there are many traces of Indian culture."
Mary put the turkey in the oven.
My joints ache when it gets cold.
Where is the nearest subway station?
Peel two of the bananas.
We'll go there again.
Go get a drink of water.
Tom has told us everything we need to know.
I'm at my parents'.
Tom is lucky to be alive.
Can you do this?
My friends invited me to dinner.
Is French taught at your school?
Eating is one of life's great pleasures.
Have fun.
Watch what you're doing!
I'm always moody.
Tom hung the three pairs of wet jeans on the clothesline.
Now I recognize you.
What's that building at the back of the hospital?
I had never seen a more beautiful sight.
Tom introduced Mary to his family.
Tom went duck hunting.
Why didn't anybody do anything?
Don't let me down.
He had to undergo an operation immediately after his fall.
I just want to get off this island.
We got this chair for nothing because the lady next door didn't need it anymore.
I found this book interesting from beginning to end.
I don't drink alcohol.
Tom has a receding hairline.
Is this your glass or your sister's?
Did you make coffee this morning?
I could hardly keep from laughing.
Tom followed Mary into the office.
Tom has escaped.
I have fifteen hundred cows.
"Concentrate, Tom."
How are you going to spend your weekend?
The family fortune has increased a great deal.
He missed the deadline.
What gave me away?
Such an old fan would be next to useless.
I saw a horse galloping toward me.
I took Tom to the hospital.
There's no free lunch.
Tom was executed for a crime he didn't commit.
I'm writing to Tom.
You don't need to panic.
Tom lost the watch that Mary gave him.
They're brother and sister.
Our train stopped suddenly.
You'd better consult your doctor.
Hurry up or you'll be late.
Tom can leave tomorrow.
Which countries have you visited?
I'm allowing you to go.
I have a faint recollection of the event.
My wife is a poor driver.
You don't know them.
The game will be called off if it rains tomorrow.
You should not give your children everything they want.
I'm very upset.
How did Tom cope with the problem?
Tom nodded slowly.
The moon is already out.
Our new head office is in Tokyo.
Do your very best.
She must still be in her twenties.
The suspect confessed.
Only God can help you now.
"You don't want to make Tom mad, do you?"
I'm sure that I can handle it.
What you did was really stupid.
Wait a moment.
He lost everything he owned.
Tom needs answers.
I am 19 years old.
He seems hungry.
Tom lived in a tent next to the river while he attended summer school.
He denied having done it.
Why isn't Tom wearing a name tag?
May I invite you to dinner?
Tom hasn't called the police yet.
There was a sudden change of plan.
Why is she so popular?
You're going to love this book.
He came to school after a long absence.
The thief fled without leaving any traces.
I never want to see that guy again.
I want you.
Tom began working.
Have you spent a lot of time in therapy?
I want to go to Germany.
I lived in Boston before I got married.
I was angry because he was late.
You have to hurry.
Have you eaten yet?
Would you please turn down the TV?
I just told you something I've never told anyone else.
This is old news.
This guy is a loser.
Does she know you?
Tom tends to exaggerate.
Tom decided to tell Mary the truth.
Dead men tell no tales.
I didn't know that at the time.
You have to see it to believe it.
"They wanted me to sell drugs for them, but I refused."
I already knew this.
The police arrested a suspect yesterday.
Leave that to me.
Tom left home at 2:30.
Who did Tom bring with him?
I thought I told you to handle this yourself.
Tom won't budge.
The old lady is still counting her change.
Tom lives around here somewhere.
Your father loves you.
"As Tom sat down, he bumped the table and his coffee spilled onto the tablecloth."
Whose pencil is this?
He showed courage in the face of danger.
He said they were responsible for the present problem.
Every rose has its thorn.
What's your feeling about the idea?
I prefer rice to bread.
Where are the strawberries?
Has Tom already told you what needs to be done?
It looks like Tom got what he wanted.
Tom loved Mary.
What's up?
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
I don't agree.
Tom pushed all the pillows off the bed.
It's important that you practice every day.
I apologize for the mess.
We have to do away with such a bad custom.
This town is increasing in population.
I can't give you the answer today.
We must not do that.
The plane crashed against the house.
Tom denied that he had done what he was accused of doing.
Tom moved to Boston three years ago.
It is out of fashion.
Sacrifice is sometimes necessary.
I'll do that.
I only need one thing.
"You're a bit early, aren't you?"
What would you do if I weren't here?
Thousands of soldiers and civilians were dying.
Look what happened.
I broke your ashtray.
I am interested in studying German culture.
That's a real load off my mind.
I caught three fish today.
My dream is to become a very strong mahjong player.
Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is.
Tom isn't afraid of you.
Tom has been trying to contact you for days.
I'm not coming back.
It was the perfect moment for a kiss.
I'll be here all morning if anyone needs me.
That's why he lost his job.
We're late.
We already know each other.
Please do not forget.
What color are Tom's eyes?
"That's a joke, right?"
"Tom is at home, isn't he?"
"Well, girls, it's time to go."
What's your favorite winter sport?

Water expands when it freezes.
"You guys love each other, right?"
Tom has a part-time job.
There seems to be only one way out of here.
We're not in the 80s anymore.
I met Tom in the park.
I'm not surprised to hear that.
Good things come to those who wait.
That can't possibly be true.
My name is Tom.
Are you an only child?
I think I'm a likeable guy.
I'm too excited to eat anything.
The dog is on the chair.
I lost my sense of direction in the snowstorm.
Tom seemed lonely.
I don't have any enemies.
It's a lot of fun skiing in fresh snow.
I'm looking for a book of jokes.
My mother is preparing supper.
Tom isn't going to listen to us.
The minister inspired us with a marvelous sermon.
He is a teacher rather than a writer.
He pointed out some spelling errors to her.
Tom and Mary don't want us here.
I could order you to do that.
Tom arrived ahead of Mary.
They stayed at home because it was very cold.
I don't need a lot of money.
Why do you feel that way?
Smoking is prohibited in all public buildings.
He is an eager beaver.
What more could you want?
The problem remains to be solved.
I think Tom can be trusted.
"Tom is from Boston, isn't he?"
That's the way we like it.
All citizens should respect the law.
She is wearing a valuable ring.
The hotel was luxurious beyond description.
"Tom thought he had plenty of time to catch his plane, but he only just made it by the skin of his teeth."
Can you tell the twins apart?
We all know that Tom is guilty.
I thought you might be able to tell me how to do this.
We have to leave in five minutes.
Why don't we try doing this again tomorrow?
What would you do if I weren't here?
I can teach you how to read.
What's it made of?
I'm stunned.
Stop. That tickles.
Tom is looking for you.
See you on the weekend.
He is ashamed of his son's conduct.
My mother is three years older than yours.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
I have a lot of work to finish up before the end of the week.

Our baby is learning to speak.
Tom has endured a lot.
She misses her family a lot.
He tried to soothe the angry man.
I went there.
You did that on purpose.
I find it hard to get up early on cold mornings.
Do you think Tom's behind what's happening now?
"Tom seldom, if ever, does that anymore."
"I tried to tell Tom, but he refused to listen."
I saw five men.
This is by far the better of the two.
Did you put Tom up to it?
There is no person to do it.
You need a change of air.
I'm going to the police station.
Could you perhaps translate that for me?
It was a difficult question to answer.
I reminded him to write to his mother soon.
You must certainly be very hungry now.
Why don't you explain that?
It's my treat.
He took a deep breath.
He came by bus.
That room is not very large.
I think it's time for me to sharpen my pencil.
I heard Tom singing in the next room.
Tom did the opposite of what he was asked to do.
The island has a fine harbor.
"Hand me that book, please."
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.
"Come on, hurry up."
That's our fault.
He will come home in a few days.
Have you really already found a new job?
I haven't done that yet.
It took a long time to accustom myself to the noise.
Don't cross this bridge.
Tom has already drunk three cups of coffee.
I like spoons.
Stand up when I am talking to you.
Does anybody know him?
Mary has received several prizes for her poetry.
Tom started to unfold the piece of paper Mary handed him.
It gets dark at five now.
"If you'd stop telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous."
He stood apart from us.

I want to buy a new bicycle.
I've got to go to another dreary meeting tomorrow.
He is clever enough to solve the problem.
Tom said that he was very optimistic.
There's no use making such a thing.
Much more can be done.
You're going to be a great father.
I cleaned the toilet.
We'll wait a while.
This store sells old books.
Tom didn't follow.
Delivery is not included in the price.
Tom has more friends than Mary.
We should keep away from the poisonous plants.
Tom began trying to break down the door.
Sit down!
He turned the corner.
"Come on, Tom. It'll be fun."
Nobody anticipated such a sharp decline in interest rates.
This is our last chance.
Where do you hold your meetings?
I was wearing my best clothes.
He couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
How can you be so cynical?
This clock gains two minutes a day.
Tell me it's not true.
Could you take me as far as my hotel?
I haven't seen these pictures in years.
We were best friends.
"Tom didn't have to tell Mary, but he did."
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
My wife thinks I'm crazy.
I was in the hospital for a few days.
Tom and Mary spent three hours discussing the plan.
I hope the weather will hold for another day.
"Those are Tom's, I think."
I'm the one with the car.
Tom is tall.
Do you want me to wait?
"Two coffees, please."
I'm waiting for you.
Where's your brother?
Who is hiding behind the curtain?
They're going to try.
Empty your bags.
Have you ever been to Disneyland?
"She shouted for help, but no one came."
Looks are not everything.
Tom seems to agree with us.
Don't forget your bag.
I didn't know you had a week off last month.
Please throw me the ball.
Must this letter be written in English?
Where is your friend from?
What is the best way to learn English?
No one ever asked.
Her health has been declining these past months.
This is the same hospital where Tom works.
"You hate them, don't you?"
It starts around 8:30.
I showed him the way.
Tom is cold.
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday.
Tom is on the other side of the river.
I won't take this any longer.
I don't think he'll come.
We want something new.
What is that smell?
It's Tom's office.
You did that on purpose.
He is not interested in art at all.
For how long have you been studying Esperanto?
We're getting sloppy.
I like fish better than meat.
I don't care what you do with your money.

"I forgot, she answered."
Trust your gut.

Why do people kill themselves?
"As soon as Tom heard the gunshots, he ran out of the house."
Tom has a dog named Cookie.
I always take a bus.
We found it.
I can't see you anymore.
The doctor saved the four people injured in the accident.
How am I supposed to sleep with all this noise?
How many boys are there in your class?
I think the best is yet to come.
I shouldn't be laughing.
You look different today.
She talks everything over with her parents.
Don't give up on love.
Tom knows how to make Mary happy.
I can't speak German.
Tom is left-handed.
I wish you were here with me.
I bet you're hungry.
Is this seat vacant?
He has been sick for a week.
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour.
Please let me pick up your sister at the station.
Can't you understand French?
What should Tom have done?
What were you dreaming about when I woke you up?
That's the village I was born in.
Tom aimed at the target.
What we need now is a break.
I bought a magazine in a store.
Tom is the smartest person I know.
It's rumored that they are going to get married.
Please think it over and let me know your decision.
We will check to see if what you have said is really the truth.
These colors harmonize very well.
Tom has short hair.
"At last, the baby fell asleep."
You haven't eaten anything.
Do you really expect me to give you money?
It's freezing cold in this country.
We might not need to sign a contract.
You can always come here.
I'm sure that's not the case.
Our eyes take time to adjust to the darkness.
"I asked Tom to come yesterday, but he didn't come."
Is that for me?

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

Could I have some water?
"When Tom went to the mailbox he found five letters, four of which were bills."
Could we have a spoon?
Tom is new here.
You should have spoken more politely.
Your reputation precedes you.
It's great to be with you.
The windows were open.
I'm going to buy some bread.
He's always complaining about the food.
There used to be a big pine tree in front of my house.
Tom became afraid.
You can't park around here.
I need to repay her.
I kept him company while his wife was in surgery.
I saw the match on television.
You're contributing.

What did you just write in your notebook?
Have a wonderful evening.
He has an eye for antiques.
Tom hasn't updated the antivirus software on his computer in a long time.
Do you want to go?
I gave it to Tom.
Tom is a very brave soul.
How did you get into the house?
The lion is the king of the beasts.
It's time to go.
Don't worry.
Remember what I told you yesterday.
She didn't like her husband.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
He'd been in Kyoto twice.
The sky was gray.
Tom said he didn't kiss Mary.
I read this book when I was in college.
Why are you always so suspicious?
He's studying Chinese.
"Tom is from Australia, isn't he?"
I was in a hurry.
You can have it for nothing.
"I like your cat, but she doesn't like me."
I helped Tom.
This is the first time I've seen anything like this.
Tom is just learning to crawl.
She came close to drowning.
Tom told Mary that their relationship was over.
All you had to do was ask and I would have lent you as much money as you needed.
I wish you hadn't told that story to my mother.
That could be a problem.
I have been to Kyoto station to see my father off.
He married a rich girl.
I've never read a novel in French.
You should have a light on.
Tom is watching television.
I never want to see you again.
I think you will approve.
Is now a good time to talk to Tom?
It was never my intention to hurt you.
I want to sleep a little more.
This is something we cannot do without.
We're friends.
Do you drink coffee every day?
I couldn't get another copy of the book.
Someone ate all the cookies from the cookie jar.
Our university usually starts on April 1st.
I paid $200 for this bag.
Get out of my room!
My mother has made me what I am today.
Don't say such things.
My house is in the suburbs.
Tom and Mary frequently complained that they never had time to spend together without the children.
"Be quiet. If you aren't quiet, you'll be thrown out."
Tom's happy.
I'm losing weight.
We have to do that this week.
I seldom eat pizza at home.
We aren't where we are supposed to be.
I don't remember inviting you here.
Most children are playful.

"Tom visited Mary, who was in the hospital with a broken bone."
Tom told me he wouldn't be coming back.
It's going to take some time.
Maybe you'll succeed.
I want to thank you again.
There is only one bus every two hours.
Tom denied Mary's requests.
Who is your teacher?
We drank all night.
Are you a Buddhist?
Tom pointed at the security camera.
He did not put up his hand.
You know the drill.
Do you follow?
That's no reason to get mad.
What are my choices?
Let's go back.
"Stop doing that, Tom."
We could keep it a secret.
Tom deposited some money in his savings account just yesterday.
Tom only had a faint inkling of what Mary was talking about.
All the teachers and students we talked to said that Tom is easy to get along with.
Can you show us the house?
I wonder who she is.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom couldn't decide whether to name his dog Cookie or Pochi.
Tom doesn't have to come.
Do you prefer subtitled or dubbed TV shows?
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
We do know what to expect.
What else do you want to talk about?
Talking to Tom is like talking to a brick wall.
Look at the sleeping baby.
I'd like to see the car before I rent it.
Tom said that he wanted to talk to me after school.
He is nothing but a child.
Count to thirty.
He had to leave the village.
Think about your future.
I think you're being a little too careful.
Is it really you?
Hardly anyone ever comes to visit me.
Nobody heard the bell ring.
Let's just leave it at that.
This can't be what I think it is.
Don't cry. Everything will be OK.
I got it for next to nothing.
I don't get along with that guy.
Tom promised Mary he'd do that for her.
Please turn the car around.
I am suspicious of him.
May I take a look at it?
Tom crawled underneath the bed.
He froze to death.
This is where Tom and Mary live.
Cars are expensive.
It is a lot of fun to listen to music.

I hope you and Tom have a good time.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
Tom has trouble hearing.
A nickel is a five-cent coin.
Staying at home is boring.
A lot has happened while you've been gone.
"Tom, is that you?"
He was unable to move.
Are you flexible?
These shoes fit my feet.
I couldn't get him to do it.
Show it to me.
I could go for a nice hot pizza right now.
Why did she come home early?
Please send us more information.
We don't even know why we're fighting.
I ate the apple.
Why am I always the one who has to suffer?
"I understand it, but I still don't agree with it."
Have you eaten supper yet?
Do you think we should import rice from the U.S.?
Please think it over.
I know precisely what you are feeling.
He never fully recovered from his injuries.
The nurses were very nice to me.
We are going to check it right away.
His advice is of no use.
We should get married.
A majority of students dislike history.
But you're not there.
He was killed in a railroad accident.
Gray hair makes you look older.
Let us go home.
Everything is OK.
Our library is on the third floor.
I must help him.
That's wise.
I was the shorter of us two.
How are you?
I can type 50 words a minute.
The store is close to my house.
I can't stay.
How many caps do you own?
She is going to have a baby.
He looks as if he had been ill.
Tom opened his suitcase again and put some more things in.

I didn't want to be alone on Valentine's Day.
He is a doctor and a university professor.
The students burned their textbooks.

I don't know how to prove this math equation.
You're annoying.
I have one of those.
Let's draw straws.

Tom knows this isn't good.
I was expecting something.
"Today is Friday, and I've done what I do almost every Friday."
Mary is wearing a yellow dress.
The house was in poor condition.
She does not smoke.
I think her name is Mary.
What are you good at?
It's my day off.
You're asking the wrong question.
He's often mistaken for a student.
The kidnappers tied Tom's hands behind his back.
I would be happy to help you.
She is always cheerful and smiling.
The president was sitting in the chair with his back to the window.
Don't say too much.
He lost his balance and fell down.
We haven't had any problems yet.
Mastering a foreign language isn't easy.
Are you ready?
"Tom is still there, waiting for you."
That is our school.
Love is blind.
Did you make this doll by yourself?
You can't say I didn't try.
I can't follow Tom's logic.

"Tom won't be able to do it by himself, so we need to ask someone to help him."
How about a walk on the beach?
Please come here.
You're the one I like.
Where's Tom hiding?
Will you please come with me?
Could you please tell me why?
Tom knows what's expected.
He took out his passport.
Why don't you leave him alone?
People talk without having anything to say.
It's entirely my fault.
Tom is tactful.
I would go to the library if I had a car to get there.
I nearly starved.
You've become a very beautiful woman.
Tom and Mary swam in the ice-cold lake.
We didn't expect you to be here.
I visited Rome for the first time in my life.
The people stood up and began to sing.
Both of them started laughing.
Is that clock going?
I should've done that yesterday.
Tom was bitten by a cobra.
It's just a cat.
Tom has big hands.
Tom was lying to you.
Don't make the same mistake I did.
What's a porcupine?
He was perfect.
I thought you said Tom was in Boston.
This organization cannot exist without you.

I ran upstairs.
Imagine yourself on a mountaintop.

Everything's fine.
Tom is extremely busy now.
I'm fed up with this wet weather.
The exhibition will be held next month.
How did you lose it?
They named their dog Lucky.
"Not knowing what to say, I remained silent."
I think he'll never return.
Today is Saturday.
Have we met before?
Ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer.
He'll make a good husband.
Tom smiled at Mary from across the room.
That was a close call.
I hope I haven't woken you up.
The enemy made a strong attack on that building.
I have no time to see you.
All the critics praised the new movie.
Tom and Mary are the best friends I've ever had.
Tom is just the man for the job.
Try thinking about something else.
Today is Tom's last day at work.
Don't cheat him.
What is for dessert?
What did they want?
Don't be upset.
Don't you want me there?
"Whatever may happen, I am prepared for it."
It won't be long before my husband comes back.
I loved you.
A good management would listen to reasonable demands.
I have a boyfriend who loves me.
English cannot be mastered overnight.
He worked from morning till evening.

He has a wealthy supporter behind him.
I didn't do anything.
We walked here.
Tom's cat had nine kittens.
The boy caught a large fish.
You're back early.
Do you have any idea where Tom went?
That bag looks expensive.
This summer we'll go to the mountains and to the sea.
The mountain is green.
I want to know why you did that.
I should've kept my mouth shut.
Tom told Mary that John doesn't like to play tennis.
Stop staring at me.

Who volunteered?
The teacher emphasized the importance of education.
Why did you run away?
The room is in immaculate order.

Don't touch anything.
You asked for our help.
Tom tried to intimidate Mary.
The party was all but over when I arrived.
There's a new girl in school.

See you at two this afternoon.
Let's stay together. It'll be safer that way.
Tom is waiting for the bus.
Tom isn't going to understand.
Ask him about it.
We had a kid just last year.
You must take the bull by the horns.
I became angry.
Are you in?
Tom is teaching French to Mary.
We'll do fine without you.
She told me an interesting story.
Walk ahead of me.
Some children are playing on the grass.

I want to go with you to the movies.
We introduced ourselves to each other.
His car has no wheels.
Are you the one who wrote this?
When's Tom going to get here?
It's time to quit.
Can you fix the broken radio?
"It's raining, but we'll go anyway."
They live in the suburbs.
He called up his uncle as soon as he got to Matsuyama.
I'm going to investigate this case.
What are your parents' jobs?

I hate to contradict you.
I'm not in a good mood either.
"Tom is lying on his bed, reading."
Don't interrupt me while I am talking.
I am an electrician.
Tom is better at speaking French than the rest of us.
Wait a sec.
Tom's wife had a baby girl yesterday.
I can't remember how I got here.
I'd like to file a complaint.
Can we enhance the image?
Some say that he was the greatest boxer who ever lived.
My house doesn't have an air conditioner.
I learned that from you.
He wears glasses.
This shirt needs ironing.
Tom's enthusiasm is infectious.

Is it good?
He loves coffee.
Tom stayed in his car.
I'm not mad anymore.
I don't want to hurt anyone.
Should we wait for Tom?
Tom came to my office to ask me for money.
You have to be careful.
I am single.
Drop your weapons!
You'll find the book in the library.
I have to write a letter.
He told me a sad story.
I can reach the top shelf.
I'll be reading a book.
Do you think it might not have been an accident?
I'm beginning to see what you mean.
I'm as old as you.
Tom was almost run over by a dump truck.
"If you do that for me, I'll be in your debt."
You really are hopeless.
I'm happy for both of you.
She flew to Europe by way of Siberia.
That was really sweet.
We'd like a table in the non-smoking section.
I won't hurt you.
How long have you known this?
Tom said he didn't speak French very well.
The boy released a bird from the cage.
Let me see your ring.
I went over to where Tom was.
Do you have any more questions?
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
Why's Tom doing that?
I have never been to America.
Water is essential to life.
The meaning is still obscure to me.
I don't usually stay at home on Monday.
"As soon as the dog saw me, it began to bark."

She suddenly became famous.
It's a terrible shame that fools are so self-confident and the wise are full of doubt.
Tom is pretty sure everything will go well.
These tools are used for building a house.
Tom wiped away his tears.

Who do you think that guy is?
He told us a lie.
Do you want me to take care of that matter?
Tom threw a stone into the pond.
We all die.
You could've answered that question.
Tom doesn't know that.

I reached the station at six.
Did you do your homework?
The diesel engine was invented by Rudolf Diesel.
Tom wanted to move to Boston.
Tom wasn't wrong.
We are in good condition.
That plane is enormous!

They visited us.
What I want to know is why.

We all have secrets.
The three boys looked at one another.
There's a sign on the door. Go see what it says.
I think it's Tom's motorcycle.
Tom knows something I don't.
Why did you call me?

You're not going to like this.
Tom is not a student.
He enjoyed cycling.
Gold is the most precious of all metals.
I want to learn how to ski.

The police arrested the suspect yesterday.
"I intended to go with her, but I was too busy."

You can not master English in a short time.
You're going to get us all in trouble.
I don't think I'd enjoy doing that.
Tom was killed in the battle.
I can't get Tom to even talk to me.
He introduced me to his relatives at the reception.
Didn't I ask you not to do that?
Tom didn't know anyone in the room.
I completely forgot about that.
This is very bad.
I go to school because I want to learn.
I don't know exactly when I'll be back.
We studied the government's economic policy.
I have recently given up smoking.

Tell her that I am busy.

We're in the garden.
Return fire.
Do you like Mozart's music?

"I was too short to reach the top shelf, so I asked Tom to get the book for me."
I'm trying to work.

"His company went bankrupt, and to make matters worse, he met with a traffic accident."
Is that what you want me to say?
Please forward my mail to this address.
I have enough money to buy it.
Tom could tell that Mary had been crying.
Tom became aware that he was no longer alone anymore.
Is she still working as a teacher?

I didn't say that.
This car runs on alcohol.
My phone is vibrating.
She sighed over her unhappy fate.
My uncle comes to see me from time to time.
How many cats do you have?
I'm not sure Tom is going to survive.
I'm not very happy.
This book is thick and the other is thin.
He has a lot of money in the bank.
Please tell me how I can get in touch with him.
I don't care what you're going to do tomorrow.
We made a sand castle.
I wish I could help you find a good job.
Was Tom annoyed?
Japanese is often said to be a difficult language to learn.
I found the missing piece of your necklace.
This sure tastes good!
You swim very quickly.
Wasn't he your boyfriend?
Tom is going to do fine.
I awoke from a dream.
The first thing Tom does every day when he gets home is turn on the TV.
Tom appeared suddenly.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
You can see the Empire State Building from here.
Tom started drawing.
All these apples are very sweet.
Tom doesn't seem much happier.
I don't like repeating myself.
Many of the states owed large amounts of money.
There's no use trying to persuade him.
Tom promised himself he'd never do that again.
You should do your best in everything.
Could you use some help?
I'm planning to come.
Tom certainly wasn't making much noise last night when we passed his house.
Tom shook his head uncomprehendingly.
I can't remember anything.
Put this sentence into English.
Tom said he's going to try something he has never done before.
I can't stand Tom.

Let's not forget that Tom doesn't understand French.
Tom is very friendly and outgoing.
I forgot my tools.
I like Tom because he's honest.
Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
Do you know why that happens?
Have you ever been to Boston before?
I'm toying with the idea.

She parked her car in a vacant lot.
"Tom almost kissed Mary, but decided not to."
Tom is early.
Tom confessed to killing his wife.
I told Tom I'd be right back.
I come from a long line of doctors.
How's married life going?
They took a vote on the motion.
Do you have enough information to go on?
I don't really like the stores there.
I like sauerkraut.
"He who seeks wisdom is a wise man, he who thinks he's found it is a fool."
Yesterday my father caught three fish.
Is it your fault or ours?
You may take either the big box or the small one.
Tom is waiting for my report.
"To the astonishment of the whole city, the mayor was arrested."
You have to listen.
His father passed away last night in the hospital.
Let's sing a song.
I've already finished my work.
My dream is to study abroad.
Come on down.
The typhoon hit Tokyo.
Tom lives from hand to mouth.
I arrived at school on time.
I admire you.
Did you write this book?
I have a lot of problems to solve.
They started the meeting without me.
Tom made Mary laugh.
I'm resting.
I'll tell you when I get back.
I heard someone scream.
Why are you in such a bad mood?
Speaking in English is fun.
Is Tom still the captain of your ship?
I know what we need to do.
Tom seems to hardly ever get his homework done on time.
Tom finds fault with everything I do.
"Tom was sitting in a comfortable armchair, reading the evening newspaper."
When are we going to use it?
I admit it. I was wrong.
Pick out the shirt that you like best.
The door is open now.
I'm twice as busy as I was before.
I'll come when I have done my homework.
Tom loves taking trips.
Nowadays his father goes to work by car.
Let's start here.
They got married and settled near Boston.
I don't like your boss.
Tom shouldn't always believe what others say.
Tom gave me a hard time.
Tom could find Mary's house easily.
This used to be a bakery.
Do it Monday.
Tom looked so contrite that for a moment Mary nearly believed that he really was sorry for what he had said.
What school do you want to go to?
Don't let him fall.
The castle is beautiful.
Tom has a reservation at this hotel.
You're too drunk to drive.
What do you mean by it?
What are your plans for Christmas?
Lots of things need fixing.
Tom put his arms around me.
Tom finally realized that he'd been wrong.
Does Tom know we're here?
He's not my boyfriend.
This organization cannot exist without you.
That's very easy to do.
Speak slowly and clearly.
It is getting hotter day by day.
I haven't heard of him since then.
He knows neither of us.
I still have to pay the phone bill.
She called to tell him that she'd be late.
Tom asked Mary where John was.
Tom is wearing a heavy coat and gloves.
I know what I need to do.
Tom is relaxed.
We're here to protect you.
Honshu is Japan's largest island.
I'm so proud of my boys.
"I can put up with a house being untidy, but I don't like it to be dirty."
Tom loves hockey.
What's Boston like?
I stayed at home.
Tom asked Mary not to wake him up before seven.
They surprised the enemy at dawn.
Is it true that Japanese think the number four is unlucky?
I burned them.
Is ten thousand yen enough?
You and Tom have a lot in common.
I wanted to say thank you for all your help.
Didn't you know that?
Can we go home and go to sleep now?
Tom was out.
I was told you were reliable.
Tom is doing a fine job.
You know where to find me if you need anything.
She hung the calendar on the wall.
I know you like Tom.
That's all I have.
Canada is to the north of the United States.
It's just a fantasy.
It's his Christmas present.
You can't take it with you.
I was busy the whole day.
Stick to your plan.
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
They disappeared.
He left immediately.
Do you want another one of these?
"Tom has a couple of tattoos, doesn't he?"
I was feeling blue.
I want to know more about Tom's biological parents.
Will you have another cup of tea?
Tom sat on the floor.
Does that frighten you?
Get lost!
I brought Tom some cookies.
We want a car.
It was a complete success.
When is your school festival?
I made him cry.
What did the doctor tell you?
I can't eat chicken.
May I come again?
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
Stop humming.
Movie theaters are losing more and more revenue due to internet piracy.
We've had a lot of storms this winter.
Better him than me.
My father died when I was three.
I don't have anything to write with.
Milk is nutritious.
Tom is absorbed in his work.
We can't help you unless you help us.
You make me want to be a better person.
I could only take what fit into the suitcase.
Tom just smiled.
Tom died there.
Tom doesn't believe in life after death.
I want to go abroad someday.
I appreciate it.
Tom and I have been friends a long time.
We'll take care of that later.
I can prove it.
You must not give up.
I can hear Tom in the kitchen washing dishes.
I'll be there in a couple of hours.
Days pass by quickly when you're busy.
Can I buy a ticket on the bus?
How would you like it if Tom did that to you?
He studied military history.
She woke him up.
Tom is the most boring person I know.
Tom is calm.
I wrote a poem in memory of my dad.
Tom always gets lost if he doesn't carry a map.
Baseball is different from cricket.
Tom is past thirty.
Tom took a book off the shelf and handed it to Mary.
What was that?
I believe you like your job.
We've got to do something.
How do you like my new suit?
You make me feel safe.
Tom bought something for Mary.
Tom has only himself to blame.
"In legal documents, difficult words and phrases are often used."
I'm sad and lonely.
All the crew were saved.
How could we have been so stupid?
Tom said he didn't see anything.
Don't let yourself be used.
You'd better get going.
I had to take a bus from Boston because all the flights had been canceled.
I just came from my house.
My dog follows me whenever I leave the room.
I think it's going to be fun.
Tom put his fork down.
I found out what's wrong with Tom.
Mary put her hands on her hips.
He's an Englishman.
Please teach me French.
I don't like living in Boston.
You didn't eat very much.
He has very short hair.
Tom barely ate.
I don't speak Catalan.
Come out with your hands up.
It occurred to me that I should not keep it secret.
Did your wish come true?
I was asked to lie.
Tom has a picture he wants to show Mary.
It was never our intention to overcharge you.
What time do you put your son to bed?
Do you want to know why I'm here?
People sometimes exaggerate their abilities.
She dropped in at my house yesterday.
It's news to me.
She put on her hat.
They constructed a bridge.
Where are the rest of the files?
Do you have anything to report?
I only hope it is not too late.
That's our fault.
How would you like your eggs?
You should get more rest.
Tom bought a dozen eggs.
Tell Tom I don't need his help.
This is going to be so much fun.
Tom had no reason not to do it.
You act surprised. What did you expect?
We're willing to learn.
I believe that he's happy.
Tom couldn't have done it.
Tom handed Mary a cup of hot coffee.
"If he had been honest, I would have employed him."
The waste of time and money is incredible.
Tom said Mary threatened him with a knife.
They met the crown princes of Sweden and Denmark.
Tom said that he'd do just about anything for Mary.
Are you listening?
Tom chose the largest apple for himself.
My neighbor called the police.
Tom concealed evidence.
Are you sure this plan will work?
It wasn't funny at all.
We consoled each other.
Whose side are you on?
That kind of story appeals to me.
This looks good.
Tom's got nothing to lose.
Are you sure about this?
Poke the fire. It's going out.
Mary is Tom's daughter-in-law.
The squirrel was busy gathering nuts.
Has Tom spoken to you about me?
This factory is almost completely automated.
I'm going to regret this.
I'm still waiting for you.
Why not ask Tom what he thinks?
She put her glasses back on.
Tom is looking forward to Christmas.
Tom comes from Australia.
"If you are not satisfied with your share, I'll make it a bit more attractive."
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
"A young boy, who couldn't have been more than five years old, asked Tom how to get to the post office."
What do you think of my theory?
My sister asked me to lend her the dictionary.
What is butter made of?
That's my neighbor's dog.
I gave him what little money I had with me.
Tom is sweeping his room.
I've finished reading the book.
What're you guys doing here?
I lost my job on Monday.
I don't want to be a freak.
Everyone knew what to do.
That's a strange question.
What are the chances that Tom will actually come?
He left three days ago.
The population of Japan is about 120 million.
My father gardens on Sundays.
I have another year at high school.
Do what he tells you.
Tom is a competent nurse.
There's one more thing you need to do.
You should try to behave better.
What are you up to today?
My father reads the newspaper every morning.
We should have told him the truth.
Tom and Mary were also there.
I'm a prisoner.
That really was a stupid thing to do.
I had nothing else to say.
I wouldn't bet on it.
Three people are missing after the flood.
We accomplished everything we wanted to.
Will you leave a message?
The sudden noise scattered the birds.
Tom's house is for sale.
You seem upset.
Why don't you give Tom a chance?
Tom hid his money under his mattress.
Tom can't walk any more.
Don't climb up the wall.
"I thought about throwing it away, but decided to keep it."
English is a Germanic language.
Tom has decided not to go to college.
I can neither confirm nor deny the rumors.
I don't see how I can refuse.
Tom never makes his bed.
We've been waiting for hours for you to show up.
I just met her on the street.
Tom usually drinks coffee without sugar.
He remained silent.
My birthday is November 10th.
You should try to enjoy yourself.
Come again.
Mary's email was very terse and it was clear that she was upset about something.
I started studying French when I was thirteen.
Does Tom still go to school?
I must find out who is behind this.
Everyone hesitated.
Tom slept all day.
The person standing near the gate is Tom.
It's free.
I have already finished reading this book.
She didn't like living in the city.
I'm just being honest.
He works in a call center.
He assumed full responsibility for it.
"To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what happened."
I know how many of them there are.
They'll never find you here.
I'm not at all interested in physics.
I think they like you.
Tom isn't a very nice guy.
Tom pushed Mary off the cliff.
Turn up the radio. I can't hear it.
Did you murder Tom?
I hate living alone.
"I have a very sweet husband, said Mary."
Tom met a woman from Australia when he was visiting Boston.
I sometimes see him on TV.
It was as hard as rock.
Tom closed his eyes and began to count sheep.
Tom and I sat next to each other on the train.
What would you like?
I've got to catch some Z's.
Air is a mixture of several gases.
Do you know where Tom put the keys?
I have something else for you.
Tom is a party animal.
Obviously he is wrong.
Tom thought that Mary wouldn't like John.
Loud music bothers me.
Can you draw me a map of your street?
Tom has a beautiful car.
It is very hot here in the summer.
I don't want Tom seeing this.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
"There are 7,097 known living languages."
It all ended as suddenly as it started.
We didn't plan this.
She lives alone in this room.
I'd like to send this package by registered mail.
This isn't mine.
Read whatever you like.
Tom got out of the shower and put his clothes back on.
That problem has been shelved for the time being.
I think it's time to wind up this meeting.
Tom and Mary are moving next month.
Tom can't make me do it.
Tom cleared the table and Mary washed the dishes.
Tom confessed everything.
He is hated.
This isn't over.
What would you do if you were ten years younger?
I've forgotten my email address.
My brother polished the silver.
I beg to differ.
She saw herself in the mirror.
Tom and Mary started walking.
Did Tom have his dinner?
Are you expecting anybody?
Please give me a ticket for the seven o'clock show.
Cheer up!
I've never witnessed so much debauchery in my entire life.
I can't see any difference.
My mother set the table for dinner.
Tom is giving you a second chance.
How often does Tom snore?
Almost a third of the gunshot victims were teenagers.
Tom saw that Mary was busy.
"The dying man made an effort to say something, but could not."
We should discuss this in private.
Tom put an envelope on Mary's desk.
The babies are taken care of by volunteers.
I guess they really weren't all that busy.
I tried not to look.
I will never do it again.
He likes animals more than people.
This picture was taken by him.
I don't think children should drink beer.
Plastic does not burn easily.
I can't just leave Tom.
Tom was poisoned.
Leftover chicken can be stored in the fridge in a sealed container for three to four days.
Why are you always talking about Tom?
Would you be interested in coming with us?
The forest was dark.
Someone is calling you.
Tom believes me.
Tom looks happy to see Mary.
What's your impression of Tom?
School begins tomorrow.
Tom lent his bicycle to Mary.
That boy said his name was Tom.
He held his breath.
Has anything strange happened?
I only eat vegetables.
"If it is used properly, this tool will be a great help."
How did you spend your vacation?
My parents live in the country.
Climate change is a global problem.
I don't want to talk about my child.
Tom came home very late last night.
He can't handle it.
I work here.
That's why Tom came.
Tom felt like going home and left without saying goodbye to anyone.
Tom can't remember exactly what Mary said.
Tom felt insignificant when he looked up at the night sky.
I have been waiting here for two hours.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'll never understand you.
This bread is very delicious.
Is this the train station?
I play soccer every day.
I want to increase my vocabulary.
I don't think your mother will like it.
Is this your phone?
Tom walked into his apartment and closed the door behind him.
It's forbidden to lean out of windows.
I wrote this letter in French.
That's not Tom. That's John.
"When I die, I want to be cremated."
Can you tell us where you were at 2:30 this afternoon?
Last week she gave birth to a beautiful daughter.
Tom helped me a lot with that.
Her hobby was collecting old coins.
Why don't you like Tom?
Tom is wrong as usual.
Tom is trustworthy.
Are these your gloves?
"When they heard the story, they burst into laughter."
"Obviously, you don't understand."
He was the last to leave.
Reading books is very interesting.
What were you hoping to accomplish?
He got out a book and began to read it.
Who's responsible?
These small letters can only be read with a magnifying glass.
One of the children left the door open.
These windows need to be washed.
"I miss you, too."
You'd better stay here.
I've always wondered what it would be like to be rich.
Modern art doesn't interest me.
I have many problems to solve.
Tom crammed everything into his suitcase.
What's it made from?
My hobby is taking pictures.
It looks as if you're right.
You're not entirely wrong.
He is thinking about the problem.
I prefer being poor to being rich.
Where's the pharmacy?
They no longer felt a need to protest.
I'm afraid you're right.
All the money was gone.
"Hold your horses, young man."
I didn't want to say anything in front of Tom.
I'll handle the rest.
Leave that alone.
Tom ate the free bread and then walked out of the restaurant.
You don't have a temperature.
You're a good friend.
I guess I should've known.
I don't think I've broken any laws.
Here are the keys.
The worst riot was in Chicago.
I don't know many words in Hebrew.
Tom says that he and Mary have played chess together many times.
She has psychic abilities.
This room has air conditioning.
She made a lot of spelling mistakes.
Do you want to hear it?
I'll always remember your kindness.
Can you come over here and help me?
Fishing is the only thing Tom wants to do.
I was frustrated.
Tom isn't strict enough with his students.
See you the week after next week.
Tom will complain.
Tom failed twice.
How old were you when you started studying French?
Would you like a second serving?
Tom thought his leg was broken.
I pretended to work.
I'm a student in a university.
Tom doesn't have a dad.
Turn off the radio.
I want your opinion.
I want to drink something cold.
That's Tom's family.
It'll be fun to visit Boston.
What was in it for you?
"Can you play the guitar? ""Yes, I can."""
I told Tom how much I valued Mary's opinion.
They hate us.
"I only buy fresh vegetables, never frozen."
"In retrospect, Tom realized he shouldn't have been dating both sisters at the same time."
I don't like to walk.
Shall I get you a ticket for the concert?
He lost his way in the snow.
No one cares.
Everyone is saying goodbye to Tom.
"He seldom, if ever, goes to church."
You've got to make sure Tom isn't late for school again.
Illness kept me from going there.
The soldier was wounded in the leg.
Tom says he'll go to Boston soon.
They all appeared satisfied with your answers.
We used to take long car trips when I was a kid.
"He's a British citizen, but he lives in India."
They approached the tourists and asked them for money.
The doctor took his pulse.
Tom kissed Mary under the mistletoe.
The doctor pronounced him dead.
It's been bought and paid for.
Can anyone pronounce this word?
I beg you to help us.
He solved the difficult problem easily.
They formed a new political party.
Can't someone else do this?
It's a pity that you can't come.
Did you stop at the red light?
That's really good news.
I'll go ask Tom.
"Tom thinks that if he had tried a little harder, he could have won the race."
I'll see you on Monday.
He needed the money.
Do you want to come?
None of us knows what is in store for us.
Tom speaks English with a heavy French accent.
Tom looked perplexed.
Have you checked the engine?
"So far, I haven't told anyone."
Their small protest triggered a mass demonstration.
Please put the book on the shelf.
The soldiers are ready for battle.
Germany borders on France.
I still have your key.
He has to work hard in order to support his family.
My mom taught me how to do it.
How are you and Tom getting along?
You remind me of your mother.
Why don't you have a girlfriend?
Winter is over and spring has come.
Where did you get that document?
I'll look after the children while you go shopping.
She was holding an umbrella.
What's in this box?
Tom didn't know that Mary was asleep.
We're not friends anymore.
I thought you'd be interested in this.
I have no time to explain this in detail.
"You had a really rough day, didn't you?"
I was lying.
He didn't want to sell the book.
What are you thinking?
I've never actually met Tom.
Boil one egg.
He likes to smoke in the toilet.
What do you plan to major in in college?
We've got a lot to do.
These boxes are made out of plastic.
I got used to it quickly.
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom looked old.
Are you going to be there?
Tom cares more than you think.
Please don't get me wrong.
I have come in response to your ad in the paper.
That's how Tom likes it.
"When we are told not to come, we become all the more eager to go."
I dropped the plate accidentally.
I would like to have a cup of coffee.
Tom takes everything for granted.
I'll go and look for Tom.
An up-to-date edition of the encyclopedia will come out next month.
Where is the entrance?
Tom has already achieved many of his goals.
My mother asked me to shave off my beard.
He was not at all satisfied.
Tom doesn't care much for swimming.
She is a very intelligent young lady.
I want to eat it.
We've hired Tom.
The heavy fog made it impossible for us to see anything in front of us.
No one trusts him any more.
I am reading a book.
Mary wore false eyelashes.
You have the advantage of a good education.
Where are your kids?
I lost my purse on my way to school.
Don't touch the button.
Come to my house at eight.
I'm not taking the bus.
We left four days later.
We're winning.
Tom doesn't need to come if he doesn't want to.
This doesn't make any sense.
I want to come.
Both sisters are blondes.
We walked ten miles that day.
Maybe you didn't understand Tom.
That was a more serious problem than we thought it would be.
Don't ask me stupid questions.
That won't be any problem at all.
I can't do it now.
You still haven't told me why you decided not to go.
His weight is double what it was ten years ago.
You don't work here.
I don't think Tom is home.
This juice tastes sour.
"Obviously, someone is lying."
I'm a little hungry.
You must stay the night.
I'll pay for it myself.
I need to practice a little more.
Tom tries to avoid traveling by air.
I know you can do this.
It's stupid.
That was cooked in oil.
"If I were rich, I would go abroad."
He is ahead of us in mathematics.
He's a very capable business man.
Tom is a bit conceited.
You don't look well.
He substituted for his father.
We have enough food now.
The earthquake was the biggest one that we had ever experienced.
I couldn't stop crying.
I promise I won't forget.
Tom seems to be slightly annoyed.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
He fired most of his men.
Did Tom hurt anyone?
This shirt must go to the laundry.
Would you like another serving?
Please don't compare me with my brother.
She has three kids.
My father's going to kill me.
He was naive.
When did you get up this morning?
Do you go to church every Sunday?
Tom's older daughter is still unmarried.
Tom certainly enjoys his wine.
Don't trust anyone.
Voice of America broadcasts from Washington.
I would highly recommend it.
Can I help you?
Are you excited?
I fell in love with her.
Why don't you try on this yellow sweater?
You can see the whole city from here.
It seems to me that you are wrong.
Tom parked across the street.
I meet him on occasion at the club.
Tom's snoring kept me awake all night.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
"How long are you in town, Tom?"
You must clean your room every day.
Tom and Mary played Pictionary last night.
We both have driver's licenses.
He regained consciousness three hours after the accident.
I'm always optimistic.
Stop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.
I'm going to go with you.
That's a safe bet.
Tom wore a black motorcycle jacket.
The restaurant is next door to the theater.
The police never caught the guy who attacked Tom.
What a strange dog!
I'm not going to lose.
Tom vomited.
Tom always sits in the back of the classroom.
Tom never wins.
"When the battle ended, not a Texan was left alive."
Tom forged his mother's signature.
Tom helped me carry the baggage.
Mary was unaware of her own beauty.
She was blinded by the glare of headlights and could not avoid the accident.
Did you get everything ready for tomorrow?
Tom paid the bill and left the restaurant.
I'm the only one who survived.
Watch your fingers.
I'll write a letter to Tom.
She cannot stop him.
How are we going to pay the rent?
I think we should lower the price.
Mary is wearing a silver ring.
You sound disappointed.
We'd like to split it. Could you bring it to us on two plates?
I remember seeing the movie before.
It isn't as cold here as in Alaska.
I'm losing.
Don't lose this key.
Are you happy?
It's high time you stopped wasting your money.
They made fun of my accent.
I'm kind of into that.
Each child was given a present.
I saw a bird flying over a tree.
Does that make you happy?
I'm happy.
My shoes are brown.
What is the matter with your car?
Tom likes rock.
I love dessert.
Cover the potatoes with cold water and bring to a boil.
Are you at home?
It's not known who first invented the wheel.
"Tom, may we speak with you alone, please?"
We're here to support Tom.
The list keeps growing.
He had his secretary translate the letter into English.
Nobody asked.
I don't love Tom.
I think he is right.
Tom doesn't know what got into Mary.
Tom opened the beer.
"At first, I thought I was sick."
Are you celebrating Christmas?
Tom and I have a daughter.
Did you go anywhere during the summer vacation?
Tom is downstairs.
Where's my wallet?
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by idiots.
I thought you loved me.
The tree fell down.
Can I please have something hot to drink?
I don't like to lose.
I think you know everyone here.
I have one brother.
Is Tom the one who took you there?
How about walking to the top of the hill?
I was ushered to my seat.
Don't ever touch me.
Tom and Mary walked through the arboretum.
Koalas are more popular than kangaroos.
We have our lives to live.
You're not a child anymore.
I want you to get off my back.
Did you have anything to do with this?
Tom's contract expires October 20th.
How high is that tower?
"If you pull too hard, the chain will break."
How did you get acquainted with her?
"Since you have a sore throat and a fever, you should probably stay in bed."
Mary turned me down when I asked her on a date.
What happens tomorrow?
He paid the money on the spot.
Kyoto is worth visiting.
I don't have enough money yet.
She became very ill.
"He said he would write to me, but he hasn't."
Five plus three is eight.
"She wanted to ask a question, so she raised her hand."
I met Tom on my way to the theater.
You should consider the problem before coming to a decision.
It's alive.
You missed the best part.
Tom called to say you can't stay with him next week when you visit Boston.
It's getting late and I have to get up early tomorrow.
We had an agreement.
I would never lend Tom any money.
I still don't see it.
Where's your mother?
He is too wise not to know that.
Do you have any cash?
Don't talk about work. We're on vacation.
Tom should've been here.
Don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.
She writes essays in addition to novels and poetry.
You can't kill us all.
"When I told them I'd done it, they looked at me like I was nuts."
Why is that?
Do you watch TV every day?
I didn't expect that Tom would fall in love with Mary.
Why can't we just go home?
I'm thinking of going to Europe.
"Look, I know what I saw."
Tom is just talking to himself.
I had my bicycle fixed by my brother.
Can you speak French?
Africa is the poorest continent.
It's a beautiful day outside.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
What kind of juice do you want?
We were aware of what was going on.
"Excuse me, please check the oil."
Tom was reading the newspaper when Mary walked in.
I think it's too early to tell.
He always keeps his room as neat as a pin.
Tom pushed the shopping cart for his mother.
Tom wants to get rich quick.
How did you come by such a job?
"From this point, we must proceed with caution."
Primitive calculating machines existed long before computers were developed.
It won't be a problem.
Seriously?

Don't worry about what others say.
Do you have a tattoo?
I'm wide open for suggestions.
It's Tom.
"Starting next week, I'll be on the late shift."
I'm satisfied with his progress.
Where is the Greek embassy?
I love bananas.
I'll go even if it rains heavily.
I'm sure Tom means well.
You didn't have to ask.
I read the article.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
He stuck a flower in his buttonhole.
The plane crashed.
You're pretty.
How was your trip?
Tom doesn't like to eat onions.
It wasn't serious.
We need twenty eggs all told.
What's your favorite leisure activity?
It looks like Tom isn't at home.
I'd appreciate it if you would turn off the lights.
Tom didn't know how old Mary was.
"Be quiet, or the baby will wake up."
Her belief in God is very firm.
Do you see the bird on the telephone wire?
How are you going to Boston?
Would you mind closing the window?
The price is kind of high for a used car.
The Jordan River is the only river flowing into the Dead Sea.
Tom told us not to worry about anything.
"They seized him and took him to Fort Monroe, Virginia."
Is eating fish good for you?
There's a man here that wants to see you.
"Sorry, the line is busy now."
Be on your guard against pickpockets.
Please let me know what you want.
Tom said that he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him.
Would you please pick me up at the hotel on Friday July 11th at 10:00 a.m.?
Do you think Tom is in love with you?
There are usually taxis in front of the train station.
The apple is not yet ripe.
Do you have a Twitter account?
Things are not always what they seem.
Tom beckoned me to follow him.
Tom helped Mary out of the boat.
She doesn't seem to be an American.
I'd like to know if that's true.
Ask her what her name is.
Why didn't you say goodbye?
Tom was surrounded by dolphins.
He's letting his fame go to his head.
Please tell me your address.
"If I were you, I wouldn't worry."
What's your favorite word?
What a nightmare!
That is mine. I don't know where his is.
Tom isn't pleased.
"No matter how hard I try, I can't remember how to do it."
Put your reading glasses on.
"The Hilton Hotel, please."
I can't understand you.
I've got a secret.
All the songs I sang for you today were written by me.
Writing news stories is his job.
I must apologize.
Tom is growing a beard again.
I've already memorized your phone number.
The world is full of fools.
Can Tom pay for all this?
They were badly in need of water.
My brother plays guitar.
Few people seem to have read the book.
What scared Tom the most was the thought that he might not be able to walk again.
I can't carry this suitcase by myself.
Tom bought some bread.
It seems that everybody likes golf.
The break is over.
I want to see it for myself.
Tom's loyalty was never in doubt.
It's not unheard of.
"I ran to school, but the bell had already rung."
You remind me of my son.
What has the world come to?
Can I help you?
"Tom does that, too."
I got no answer.
Tom can ride a horse.
Your question is hard to answer.
I'm going to lay aside that money for emergencies.
Tom looks like he's a bit tired.
You're wounded.
I've been waiting for you for over an hour.
What time do you finish school?
I don't like baseball at all.
What is this letter?
Do you have a girlfriend?
We're meeting at my place at 2:30.
We can't just leave Tom here by himself.
Just let Tom go.
Tom woke up naked.
This isn't my first time to be here.
He never wears a tie.
I'd rather not go home.
Do you know what Tom is up to?
You're making a big mistake.
"Are you ready, Tom?"
Are you planning on buying a car?
I can't tell her from her twin sister.
"If Tom doesn't mind, I'd like to join him for lunch."
Which shoes are you going to put on?
"Unless they have a good wine list, I don't want to eat here."
What did Tom find?
Tell them what happened.
Why do you have that?
What he said turned out to be a lie.
He ran out of the room in anger.
Do you know where it is?
I locked the front door.
Maybe I should stop now.
The situation is deteriorating.
How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?
It's great that you were able to come.
Repetition is the mother of learning.
She has two daughters.
The room in which the exam was being held was very hot.
Let's drink the cup of tea here.
"Boys, as a rule, are taller than girls."
I tend to laugh when I'm nervous.
"Make way, please."
I saw Tom in the park.
That's unacceptable.
I know the truth.
We went aboard the plane.
I received a letter written in English.
I'd like to stay here with Tom.
Try it once more.
Do you want to go out?
"Which do you prefer, spring or autumn?"
Don't change your mind.
What's your favorite drink?
Tom said he could help Mary.
They're crazy.
"Dad, do you believe in ghosts?"
We love each other and that's all that matters.
What did you do with your camera?
I didn't tell anybody about it.
When does your vacation start?
This metal is called zinc.
"I had to wait for a long time for Tom's answer, but it was worth it."
What is this for?
Don't make a spectacle of yourself crying in the street.
Everything makes sense now.
The water rose to a level of 10 meters.
I know exactly who it is.
The game ended at nine o'clock.
Nobody came to the party.
I put cream in my coffee.
Come anytime you like.
Boys are stupid.
He wanted to come with us.
I wish you had told me that.
Please put your waste in the bins outside.
I hope that he will help me.
The radio is on.
Tom fought hard.
Could you send someone up to make the bed?
He had a lot of things to do.
Look at it again.
Tom got a bottle of water out of the fridge.
I like winter better than summer.
The seat of my pants is torn.
Let's try to reason with them.
Tom led the group of boys down the corridor.
Participation is voluntary and free of charge.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
I don't blame you for hating me.
Tom was sitting on the hood of the car.
"If you ask me, it was just a waste of time."
I stayed home all day instead of going to work.
It was the calm before the storm.
I thought you'd decided against it.
Sugar is sweet.
The dough used for pancakes is thin.
I don't know what the answer is.
"You're the one that wanted to see me, aren't you?"
Are you sure you don't want to go to the doctor?
Prices have gone down.
How did Tom ever get Mary to go out with him?
He knows a lot about butterflies.
It needs washing.
I got a rash on my hands from dishwasher detergent.
Tom was paroled last month.
You're an optimist.
This is a picture of the ship I was on.
This type of mobile phone sells well.
He has a swimming pool.
I love to dance.
What's your favorite search engine?
Tom needs to get a haircut.
Tell me the truth.
My mother forgot to add salt to the salad.
The story had a happy ending.
You don't need to wait.
Tom asked me to wake him up at six.
That's the worst passport photo I've ever seen.
I was the only woman.
Tom asked a few good questions.
Tom insists on coming with me.
Stop pretending that everything's okay. It's not.
He ran into the room.
Tom is not home right now.
I'd rather not eat the meat from an animal that was cloned.
Stop talking and get back to work.
"After you, Tom."
He fell into a deep slumber.
We looked up.
I think you're pretty hard on yourself.
"You're with me, aren't you?"
Tom doesn't know the reason.
The trouble is that it costs too much.
How about going to see a movie with me?
I can't share it with anyone.
"Tom wanted to give you a surprise party, but I knew you'd hate it, so I told him not to."
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
Tom didn't try to stop Mary.
I have an ear infection.
I'll call you when I arrive in Boston.
My family's not rich.
Tom is involved in everything.
Tom doesn't know the reason why Mary is absent.
I need to learn Japanese.
Tom is lying in bed with a cold.
Her speech moved the audience.
I guess that the beautiful girl will say goodbye to the shy young man.
I was not conscious of his presence.
Keep cool.
Tom broke into Mary's house.
"While she was out, the thief got away with her jewels."
Tom didn't need to think very long before he gave Mary his answer.
I'll give these to you.
Almost everyone I know can speak French.
Is this camera for sale?
"You've been here a long time, haven't you?"
Don't forget that she's a woman.
You said that you loved Tom.
You must apologize to Tom.
The sun sets in the west.
"Tom probably won't be here today, either."
I can't do without this dictionary.
Watch out for pickpockets.
Tom doesn't feel comfortable talking about his feelings.
"You've got a lot of stuff going on at the moment, so why don't you take the rest of the week off to deal with whatever those issues are?"
"Oh, don't be so modest."
What is it?
I have two dogs. One is white and the other black.
Here's what I think.
Her decision to move to Chicago surprised us.
That cheese is made from goat's milk.
He keeps a cat.
It was never my intention to hurt you.
All your problems have been solved.
Be careful what you say.
Tom and I are friends.
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
He has her under his thumb.
"That's what you do, isn't it?"
You won't find what you're looking for here.
Who is in this room?
Are they Canadian?
When did you last hear from Tom?
I'm glad you didn't go there by yourself.
Call security!
I like cartoons.
He needs it.
Tom can speak a little French.
I found it easy to solve the problem.
"Could I get some water, please?"
Tom didn't expect the test to be easy.
Tom clearly enjoys driving.
Tom squatted down next to his dog.
You've got the wrong number.
This is an extremely important point.
I don't intend to do what Tom told me to do.
"When I was a kid, there'd be nightly arguments about whose turn it was to wash up."
I couldn't have expressed it better.
Summer holiday begins in July.
I saw immediately that he was uncomfortable.
Can you find it?
He can write with either hand.
I think the actions he took were right.
She finished her exercises in the given time.
Are you here to arrest me?
The woman washes her face.
Tallinn is the capital of Estonia.
I live here because it's close to where I work.
Does Tom sing well?
He had lost all hope.
"Mary's not the first woman to fall in love with a married man, and she won't be the last."
Tom didn't tell Mary he wanted to quit his job.
Women like colorful umbrellas.
I'm ready for a vacation.
"That job wasn't very interesting. However, the pay was good."
Laughing is really good for you.
Tom unbuttoned his shirt and tossed it aside.
Let's build something.
"If I create an example, will you correct it for me?"
Tom had hoped that he would win the lottery.
Do you have a tatami room for ten people?
I don't want to see anybody today.
Am I supposed to eat this?
Tom persuaded Mary that she should try again.
Further details are presented below.
It's a minor glitch.
Tom and I'll take turns watching your kids.
He gave her an approving nod.
Money is not everything.
"To the best of my knowledge, he will not come."
He was in the habit of taking a walk before breakfast.
Everyone seems to be nervous.
Tom closed the magazine and put it into his knapsack.
You need to go there yourself.
He tried to approach her using every possible means.
"You think this is funny, don't you?"
Are there any objections?
What day is it?
That car is quite new.
Tom was brought up by his aunt and uncle.
Mary hiked her skirt up to mid-thigh and dipped her toes in the water.
My boss has a grudge against me.
I can't understand that word.
The bank doesn't open for another hour.
Tom had a good teacher.
Everybody agreed with his idea.
Tom cut school.
Dogs like squeaky toys.
I go jogging.
Tom loves rituals.
"Tom is colorblind, so he couldn't tell if Mary was wearing a green dress or a red dress."
Is she a pretty girl?
I'd like to pay by check.
I have two cameras.
All children do not like apples.
Stay here and wait for him.
Don't forget your money.
A strange man was walking back and forth in front of my house.
There isn't any soap.
Did you use my knife?
How long will this cold weather continue?
We were younger then.
It is up to you to see to it that such a thing doesn't happen.
Tom is too old to be living on his own.
I don't have as much money as you think.
I see no other course of action.

He is in trouble.
She picked a lot of beautiful flowers.
Don't believe people who claim that they know everything.
We used emergency measures to revive the cardiac arrest patient.
I bet you know French.

I'm looking for you.
Does anyone know Tom's family name?
You make me want to cry.
That can't be denied.
My mother permitted me to go to the movies.
An innocent man was arrested by mistake.
Tom and I don't want that.
You could search the world over and never find another man more honest than Tom.
Am I supposed to thank you?
He promised not to tell that to anyone.
He is still full of energy.
Tom speaks French as well as anybody else in this room.
"A new study shows that everything we thought we knew up to now, is wrong."
Tom likes science fiction.
Jose is lactose intolerant.
Tom's father is not listed on his birth certificate.
My instinct was right.
Nobody wants you to do that.
Did anybody tell you anything about it?
Tom is growing a beard again.
Food is still scarce in the region.
There's something under the bed.
Tom has been restless all day.
Tom and Mary watched the sun rise over the ocean.

Jesus wept.
When will dinner be ready?
I dreamed about you the other day.
I think I remember how to do that.
Tom filled the bottle with drinking water.
Tom has dark skin.
I could do this all day.
Tom is learning how to defend himself.
Australia is rich in natural resources.
Please step inside.
Let's presume you're right.
"Each time I see Mary, I learn something new and important from her."
I used to go fishing in the river when I was a child.
I am curious.
I did not understand him at all.
This is incredibly frustrating.
He fell in love with his best friend.
Tom signed up for a French class.
I'm afraid that's not good enough.
The manager complimented him on his achievement.
Your help will save us a lot of work.
"Where is my wife? ""She is in jail."""
He fell in love with a younger woman.
Please keep in touch.
It's a complicated question to answer.
"If you drink, don't drive. If you drive, don't drink."
She will give you what money she has.
What are you looking for?
They charged us more than we expected.
I know exactly what you're feeling.
Tom looks alarmed.
Tom looked like an old man.
Tom was killed by a drunk driver.
The book is too expensive.
I will speak to him alone.
Please make the bed.
Tom opened the trunk and found it empty.
Will you keep this seat for me?
I hate everyone.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
Why don't you just back off?
I'll take Tom to Mary.
How did you like that movie?
I need to look at my notes.
You don't know what Tom is like.
Do you have a pet?
"If I had enough money, I could buy it."
The train will arrive at the station before noon.
"I really wish I could go with you, but I can't."
Tom has nothing better to do right now.
We know what you're capable of.
This task requires dexterity.
"Tom came into the room, carrying a bunch of flowers."
"You know who I am, don't you?"
He hung up.
Tom couldn't answer all of Mary's questions.
Tom and Mary talked about sports.
Tom always needs to have the last word.
You always say that.
Get a move on.
I'd never seen anything like that before.
The surgeon who operated on Tom is very experienced and highly regarded.
"If I were you, I'd go."
We're doing nothing.
I think I missed something.
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
She is a second-rate singer at best.
You're a good father.
What are you thinking?
Where's everybody else?
They can't stop you.
You could get arrested for that.
How will I find it?
You give me so much.
Tom thought Mary was kidding.
I wonder whether Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
We got up early so that we could see the sunrise.
Can't we just talk this over?
Her eyes filled with tears.
I hope you caught more fish than I did.
My grandfather died of a disease at eighty.
I am wasting my time.
How could you allow it?
I have a message.
This is my mother's computer.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
I like that tie.
That problem is too simple.
I still haven't apologized to Tom.
The ship was soon out of sight.
The sun is bright.
"Ah, that's much better."
We couldn't have done this without your help.
It's just too soon.
Tom staggered.
Tom called Mary this morning.
"Obviously, you've changed your mind."
I'd like to buy a map.
She is going to France next week.
How many weeks of vacation do you have?
He bought a double-barreled shotgun.
Step aside.
Mary threw me out of the kitchen.
Do you want to spend the next ten years in prison?
She lives far from there.
I'm thinking about you.
Where do I go from here?
The outcome of the upcoming election will be the hardest ever to predict.
Tom left the office immediately after work.
I had some engine trouble yesterday.
You should eat something.
He called me up almost every day.
"No matter what you say, I won't give up."
It appears the storm has calmed down.
I won't bore you with the details.
He fixed the broken table.
We're going to try.
Where are you taking us?
She stood up and walked to the window.
Perhaps Tom left.
I forgot to tell you what Tom said.
The summer is over.
Why did they arrest him?
Fill in this application form and send it at once.
"Hey, look at that."
I wish I hadn't cried.
I've never taught anyone anything.
My father always speaks in a very loud voice.
Tom told me he was studying French.
We'll need an extra ten dollars.
He doesn't like traveling by air.
We have to be prepared for anything.
Be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.
He fell from the tree.
I'm learning so much from you.
I had no work yesterday.
You may look.
I have great respect for him.
What did Tom do wrong?
Europeans like to drink wine.
Tom opened the window a crack.
There won't be a choice.
She always smiles at me.
I've thought about you a lot.
Tom thought he was losing his mind.
Try not to fall.
I heard a little girl crying.
Is there some problem?
Mary's so nice that you can't help but like her.
You should try to figure it out for yourself.
What did you try to do?
When will you ever learn?
Tom was there on business.
Tom took me for my brother.
May I say something?
Mary wore an eyecatching dress.
Tom refused to continue to ignore the way Mary was behaving at school.
Tom bowed and kissed Mary's hand.
Tom wanted to protect Mary.
She is shy of strangers.
Tom thinks Mary may have an eating disorder.
I told Tom that he was a fool to let Mary talk to him that way.
I want you out of my office.
She has to go shopping in the afternoon.
He took the trouble to send me the book.
Who was the girl you were talking to?
"You lost, didn't you?"
"I live near her house, but I seldom see her."
Today is a good day to die.
Tom has gone to the park.
We will never forget the day the typhoon ruined the crops.
He made her happy.
You can't possibly be that naive.
I trained my dog to bring me the newspaper in the morning.
Look at how white Tom's teeth are.
When was the last time you were in Boston?
It's a waste of time to wait any longer.
Are you Catholic?
I get up at six in the morning.
Could you suggest a good beauty parlor near here?
I don't regret anything.
Give them to me.
I don't want to waste my money.
That won't happen again.
I don't understand what you are trying to say.
Success usually requires hard work.
I can't keep this up.
I'll help you find somewhere to live.
Tom changed the locks on his doors.
One of the kids broke the lock.
It's very unlikely that he is actually the same man you met ten years ago.
Thank you for giving this to me.
Do you know what's going on there?
This sentence needs to be checked.
Do you know how it feels to lose an old friend?
Would you please tell me the way?
She made him happy.
Tom couldn't help.
Are you as tall as me?
I think Tom can help.
I don't think Tom can hear me.
They are sitting at the table.
I love to read books.
I think Tom is normal.
"If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money?"
Tom is self-centered.
I'm sure that wasn't Tom's dog.
You'll never make it out here alive.
Now it's your turn.
I had the gardener plant some trees.
Nobody lives in this house.
It happened.
We sang in loud voices.
Who owns this ship?
You're jealous.
I want you to take me to Tom.
Don't swim in the river.
Are you looking for a job?
That's my answer.
That's Tom's.
You know your stuff.
I didn't feed the dog.
He's a very nice boy.
Tom thought that his house was haunted.
Tom bought an engagement ring for Mary with money he inherited from his grandfather.
I don't know how I can help you.
You keep forgetting to do your homework.
He deserves a promotion.
The bread really smells good.
I'd like a Manhattan.
Tom had to run.
She then proceeded to negotiate with her bank.
I just want to know if you love me.
I knew Tom would be back.
Can you see the difference?
You seem to be relieved.
Tom should have been eating more vegetables and not as much meat.
It is absurd trying to persuade him.
Why is this happening to me?
She needs a coat.
"Give us two knives and four forks, please."
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
I want to buy a new computer.
That girl looks like Mary.
A secure income is an important thing for me.
"Had it not been for your help, I couldn't have done it."
Advanced countries must give aid to developing countries.
He taught me how to swim.
Tom and Mary looked at each other with concern.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
What are you going to be when you grow up?
Tom died in an accident.
Tom loves going out with his friends.
Many people do this.
He pretended not to know me.
I can't just lie to Tom.
Don't you want to say goodbye to Tom?
I would do anything for Tom.
It will cost you more to go by plane.
I wasn't asleep.
We didn't want to worry you.
I wear contact lenses.
There was nothing we could have done.
This information is confidential.
Everyone is waiting anxiously.
This place is very dirty.
How do you like my new hat?
I found the missing piece of your necklace.
He trusted you.
Are you still upset?
I'm ready to leave this place.
I need to talk with Tom.
Tom will agree.
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
How long have you been busy?
Tom sleeps all day and is up all night.
Tom has gained thirteen pounds.
We understand each other.
They caught a bear alive.
Let's take a walk for a change.
I'm not going.
He's standing on his head.
I knew Tom would do something stupid.
Tom is trustworthy.
He forced his way into the room.
Would you have time to help me with something?
"Every time I practice shooting, I miss the target."
I did everything I could to save Tom.
I'm not going unless Tom goes.
They're taking Mary to the emergency room.
I love the way you kiss me.
I think it must've been Tom who sent Mary that note.
I talked with her for an hour.
Have a nice time.
It has sentimental value.
It's perfect.
I bought a used truck.
Are you staying at this hotel?
I hope you practiced your solo.
He found my bike.
You've lost too much blood.
"That brown one is mine, too."
He was about to speak.
He just texted me.
I will protect you from danger.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
Have you dug up the potatoes?
Stop telling everyone you're my brother.
Aren't you going to say goodbye?
You're worried.
Tom said that he thought that I might need to do that by myself.
Tom is willing to do almost anything for money.
What makes you think I want this?
I don't know when he entered the building.
Yesterday was the first time Tom had ever played in front of an audience.
We saw a boy run over by a truck.
It was a wise decision.
You must learn from your mistakes.
Do you have jeans in my size?
Are you watching your weight?
Tom is coming with me to Boston.
Did you remember to do what I asked you to do?
The girl didn't say anything.
Do we really need it?
Mr. Jackson is in a very important meeting right now.
Did Tom work there?
Look up there.
There's not a chance.
Who's your favorite singer-songwriter?
She began crying.
"Tom lives on a farm with his wife, Mary, not too far from Boston."
You're very good at what you do.
Do you want to end up like Tom?
They set fire to their neighbour's house in revenge.
I couldn't get back to sleep.
I arrived in Kobe around two thirty.
Tom helped Mary get back on her feet.
Are you a doctor?
Could I borrow this book for a few days?
My life is so boring.
"If I were to tell you the whole truth, you would be amazed."
It's not a joke.
Are you going to stop me?
What he is saying does not make sense.
"Frankly, I don't like your idea."
They are playing chess.
He had the last laugh.
Does that make a difference?
He and his friend sat on the bench.
"I like it, too."
Tom made me say those things.
Can you open the door for me?
Aren't you going to study French?
There's only one copy of this document.
He broke the flower vase on purpose.
It's not exactly rocket science.
Tom wrote his phone number on a napkin and handed it to Mary.
Please don't make me help Tom.
I took my clothes to be cleaned.
"Tom opened the door, expecting to see Mary."
She's wearing a light blue suit.
Tom has asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
You're just in time for dinner.
Be careful not to burn yourself.
Let's split.
There's a difference.
Can I speak to the doctor?
I am a Muslim.
Once in a while everything goes wrong.
Tom and Mary got married without their parents' consent.
I need to find out.
Tom immediately began crying again.
They're cold.
I just want to improve as much as I can.
Can I see the special exhibit with this ticket?
Do you buy that explanation?
I'll teach you how to write.

Do you have a cellphone?
How was it?
Did the test results shock you?

How far along are you?
His dog appeared suddenly from behind the door.
You were happy.
Can you make yourself understood in French?

My mother made me practice the piano every day when I was a kid.

We've got less than three minutes.
Fish live in the sea.
I think I need to see a doctor.
This boy gives us a lot of trouble.
What should I say to Tom?
I assume you can speak French.
I saw you yesterday.
Many Italian-Americans can't speak Italian.
What is it you're afraid of?
You aren't allowed in here.
"I'm going to miss you, too."
Let's wait until six o'clock.
I'm beginning to see the picture.

Tom was afraid to cross the road.
Tell me why you want to go there.
Let's put up the Christmas tree here.
Don't rely on what he says.
"Come on, Tom. Don't be shy."
I suppose I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.
They walked upstairs.
I need to know.
I don't think you're being honest.
We should call Tom.
The plans for the offensive were secret.
Tom always had to do everything himself.
We had not gone very far when it started to rain.
He walks his dog every morning.

These are interesting times.
I've got a lot of work to do.

Whatever we find in here is mine.
You don't have to hurry.
I like this cup.
This is by far the best way.
The girl seems to be rich.
I'm happy you're happy.
It is cruel of him to say such things to her.
I assume you're angry.
I dropped my sandwich.
I love to watch anime.
Tom smoked.
Who's that cute guy I saw you with yesterday?
I thought that was obvious.
Where did I leave my glasses?
Which one do you like best?
Aren't you late?
I was just about to go to bed.
Why don't you come over to my house for dinner tomorrow?
We're wasting precious time.
My father gets up early.
The police could not control the mob.
Why didn't anyone tell me?
I thought you said you didn't speak French.
Instead of fewer accidents there are more.

That's not how it works.
Follow behind me.

Tom made it look so easy.
Did you know this?
All the boys were whistling and cheering.

"I love you, too."
"You have a little fever today, don't you?"
That's pretty easy to fix.
Tom agreed reluctantly.
We had snow this morning.
She likes music very much.
Tom heard the door open.
What's the most disgusting food you have ever eaten?

Tom is dancing.
What's your favorite color for carpets?
The girl was always following her mother.

They think that Tom followed Mary home and killed her.
It has begun.
You look stunning.
Tom has a point.

I found it easy to speak English.
His aim is to become a lawyer.

Could you please overlook it this time?
It's time for me to be on my way.
She has an eye for beauty.
The price depends on the size.
How can we achieve a balance between work and personal life?
Beat it.
She answered my letter right away.
Would you mind reading it to me?
Why do you want that anyway?
I'm totally confused.
I look forward to reading your report.
It's very kind of you to help me with my homework.
I was just teasing you.
It is courageous of you to say such a thing.
What pretty flowers!
What we did was a mistake.
Tom wants to be here.
Tom has a poor memory.
Mother told me to clean the room.
That doesn't happen often.
Why is it so quiet here?
Tom called the suicide hotline.
I think that Tom can swim fairly well.
What do you expect me to do?
I pigged out on pizza.
We still want to help you.
What do you want that old thing for?
Tom stopped digging.
Some children are swimming in the sea.
Do whatever it is that he tells you to do.
Will you accompany me?
I am afraid he will make a mistake.

It's fun to build a snowman in winter.
It's really annoying.
Do you want him?
Tom has some good news to tell you.
It would be a pity if you missed out on seeing Tom while you're in Boston.
She did not keep her promise to write to me.
Jealousy was the motive for the murder.
We held a farewell party in honor of Dr. Kawamura.
It's fifty kilometers to Paris.
Tom allowed the police to search his home.
Are you sure about that?
Tom is a little taller than you are.
He behaved like a child.
We haven't yet done everything we need to do.

"Because my mother is sick, my father will cook today."
You don't have to stay to the end.

How deep is it?
This was the right choice.
You have an alternative.

He has another son.
It's a matter of personal preference.
Tom stole a lot of money from Mary.
It wasn't a coincidence.
When do you leave for school?
I've just been mugged.
The president is out now.
"If I knew that, I'd tell you."
It's getting ridiculous.
I told you you'd be disappointed.
Do you have a big family?
We're going alone.
I realized that I had grown up when I started heeding my parents' advice.
There isn't much money in this business.
Tom was sleeping when Mary rang the doorbell.
I am dying to see her again.
The side of the house was covered with ivy.
Why am I so tired?
He is my colleague.
I thought you'd want this one.
His family emigrated to the United States.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I think Tom wouldn't mind.
We only have three bicycles.
Please peel the potatoes.
Can you direct me to the train station?
It has been the driest June for thirty years.
"I tried to call him up, but the line was busy."
Mary is knitting Tom a scarf.

Tom spent three years in jail.
Tom needs hope.
I like this house as it is.
The building is already under construction.
I love hanging out with my friends.
I was the first to begin speaking.
Tom squinted.
The problem was very difficult.
Don't be worried.
The government should invest more money in industry.
Pick up your things and go away.
What'll you have to drink?
A friend to all is a friend to none.
She is a beauty.
Please pay at this counter.
I don't quite follow you.
Tom disappeared without a trace.
This is a very entertaining story.
I decided to give Tom another chance.
Success depends mostly on effort.
I want to buy this material for a new dress. How much does it cost?
I can't bear it any longer.
Mary is very attractive.
They sat on a bench in the park.
Can I help you with that?
Tom hasn't been back here for years.
"If you find money on the street, you should take it to your local police department."
The man took my arm.
Tom is planning to study abroad next year.
Will we arrive on time?
Tom is chopping firewood.
Don't leave me behind!
Tom is creative.
Your approval is important to me.
I found it difficult to use the machine.
He behaved himself like a man.
I just wanted to make sure you knew what to do.
I've been in Australia for over a year.
I'd like to be like Tom.
We went as far as Kyoto.
Please don't sit on that bench.
Stop looking at that girl.
Tom really loves animals.
Perhaps Tom was wrong.
There's also a yellow one.
I'd like to hear you play the clarinet.
You may have it.
Wait in the waiting room.
I'm fairly certain that Tom will pass today's exam.
There's no need to hurry.
Our problems are nothing compared to theirs.
Let's begin on page 30.
Excuse me for opening your letter by mistake.
Tom was quite pleased with himself.
Water is as precious as air.
Tom has just finished eating dinner.
They'll try again.
I haven't spoken French in three years.
He arrived at the station.
He got bored quickly.
We studied English.
I have no one to play with.
He tried to speak French to us.
Where's the ice?
Tom rushed home to get his washing off the line before the rain started.
We need to protect Tom.
He listened to the music with his eyes closed.
Tom thinks that the world is getting worse all the time.
I met her in the winter three years ago.
I can't get this old TV to work.
The old church on the hill dates back to the twelfth century.
Tom will hurry.
I don't wash my hair in the morning.
There is no milk left.
I missed my flight. Can I get on the next flight?
Tom is very good at it.
It seems that Tom is lying.
You lost the game.
"We have three dogs, one white and two black."
Why don't we take a taxi?
This cold weather isn't usual for June.
Tom opened the door for Mary.
I feel like another person.
Stand aside.
Here are your keys.
Just tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.
Tom fell in love with a beautiful girl.
Nothing special happened.
I am convinced that he did nothing wrong.

She is able to skate.
She boiled the eggs.
We used to work together.
He's in hot water.
What are we going to do about that?

They're not a threat.
He will not stay for more than four days.
You lied to me.
I'm sure you'll like Tom.
He has been working on a new book for two months.
I am terribly hungry.
I went fishing with Tom last weekend.
Let's take it one step at a time.
Their names were crossed off the list.
Why are you learning English?
She disappeared in the dark.
They're students.
I don't know what's in this box.
It makes no difference what she said.
Shoes are sold in pairs.
I don't care what you think.
It's all over now.
"If you will excuse me for a few minutes, I'd like to make a call."
What you're saying makes no sense.
You're too young to understand.
Tom knows he can't change Mary's mind.
We're not happy.
The old man tends to exaggerate.
Tom said Mary was good at French.
The river carries a huge volume of water.
The day isn't over yet.
"May I have your attention, please?"
Tom turned green with envy.
I wish I'd planted more lettuce this year.
They'll announce the winner tomorrow.
She will have to cook for everyone.
Tom shouldn't have driven Mary's car.
Please write it down.
The garden was surrounded by a wooden fence.
Your services are no longer required.
I shouldn't have wasted my time.
We have to start at once.
I haven't got much money with me.
How did Tom know that Mary would be here?
Just check it.
A child whose parents are dead is called an orphan.
Tom and I are twins.
Tom says that he's never lied to Mary.
I hate the tie you're wearing.
"If she had told me the truth, I wouldn't be angry."
Tom is working on it now.
Please have a drink.
I don't know her at all.
Tom was bitten by a snake.
It's not a game.
Tom turned around quickly.
Tom grew up in the ghetto.
It'll save time if we avoid Park Street.
We conducted our investigation with the greatest care.
I owe him $100.

I expect to be paid for this work by tomorrow.
There is enough time to finish this homework.

They're not here.
Don't worry. I won't tell.
Have you visited a zoo in your country?
That boy has black hair.
I have a bad pain in my back.
I hear you're moving to Australia.
You can't carry on like this.
"The moment I held the baby in my arms, it began to cry."
"If they were Canadians, this problem wouldn't exist."
Nature is cruel.
Tom took a picture of his own camera.
That's all for today.
I want to climb Mt. Fuji again.
Tom had no idea of what was going on.
"I'm in none of the pictures, because I took them."
She admits that she stole the jewels.
Did you find anything in the room?
Tom and I'll go with Mary.
I can't picture Tom doing that.
Tom is a corrections officer.
You're dying.
He had all the attributes of a leader.
I knew better than to ask questions.
"Seeing me, they suddenly stopped talking."
What day of the week is it?
We are accustomed to wearing shoes.
It looks like you were right. Tom was the guy who stole Mary's violin.
I wish I could take back what I said.
"As you already know, I don't speak French very well, so I'd rather not give a speech in French."
She heard him scream.
He gave me what I needed.
Millions of people starve to death every year.

She doesn't know what she really wants.
I can't deny it.
This box is full of books.
Your things are all here.
I have three friends that often drop by on Saturdays.
Tom can drive a car.
Tom is very sweet.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you've done.
That house over there is where Tom lives.
He accepted my idea.
What do you see in Tom?
I am waiting for my driver.
He spoke for ten minutes without a pause.
I offered to help her with her homework.
Put that knife down. You're making me nervous.
I have a lot of flowers.
It's very difficult to carry out that project.
Tom works in archaeology.
I had never done anything like that before.
Give peace a chance.
Tom tried to attract Mary's attention.
Can you please look the other way?
What do you have for me today?
He gave it to me.
It's an optical illusion.
Tom never listens to what the teacher says.
Tom has his eyes closed and is pretending to be asleep.
Tom began coughing.
Do you want one of them?
It must be pretty cold.
Tom's amazed.
Do whatever you have to do.
I have three pieces of baggage.
Take this prescription to your pharmacy.
Tom is polite and sensitive.
The weather was getting worse and worse.
It's a nice day for a walk.
They were too tired to fight.

It was an amazing game.
Tom stayed seated.
My mother is a teacher.
Tom can speak French pretty well.
You may sit wherever you like.
Tom spends all his time thinking about Mary.
What're you watching?
It's open to interpretation.
Tom and Mary have become very good friends.
I can keep a secret.
I have trouble falling asleep because I always have a lot on my mind.
You're wasting our time.
"It is easy to form a plan, but it is difficult to carry it out."
Tom shouldn't have written that.
Mt. Fuji is noted for its beautiful shape.
Deal with it!
"As long as there's life, there is hope."
Why don't you go?
"From my point of view, Australia is one of the best countries in the world."
I finally gave up.
Tell the truth.
Tom began to like Mary more and more.
I will be sixteen in May.
Tom may come at any time.
"You're busy, aren't you?"
I came to this country for the purpose of studying music.
I still have some homework to do.
He attended the meeting in my place.
Tom is a farm worker.
There's no freedom of religion in this country.
I wish I hadn't spent so much money.
This is accurate.
That trio has already put out five albums.
Tom said he'd never planned to stay that long.
I want you to stay on the beach.
I'm going back to America.
He turned off the light.
What did you eat for lunch today?
It's an hour's walk to the station.
He tends to tell lies.
The opening ceremony took place yesterday.
Tom claimed he was the son of a rich man.
This is too important to overlook.
Get out of my office.
Some abstract art is difficult to understand.
Please read the whole story.
Tom went without lunch because he didn't have enough time to eat.
Help me with my homework.
Will you please let me go now?
Please correct the sentence.
Tom said that he needs to learn how to do that.
Stop pulling my hair!
They won't find you.
His dog was named Popeye by him.
I can't let you leave.
You have no idea what this means to me.
We spent three hours in the open air.
When did you buy this car?
Tom reached for a dictionary that was on the very top of the shelf.
The princess couldn't help laughing at him.
All you have to do is wait and see.
You're busy all the time.
Look at the large building over there.
Why don't you drop in?
When was the last time you tidied your room?
We're a long way from being finished.
There was a lot of furniture in the room.
I feel queasy.
We were not to blame for the accident.
That's evident.
It was extremely cold.
Where's Tom?
The slave tried to escape.
Who're you calling now?
Do you want me to call Tom?
"Excuse me, but I think this is my seat."
How many books are on the shelf?
"Come again tomorrow afternoon, when I will have more time to talk with you."
Tom could never fall for a woman like Mary.
Tom talked Mary into going to the concert with him.
Tom heard the scream.
You had better see the cloth with your own eyes.
You're really gifted.
You smell good.
He ran his fingers through her hair.
It had been snowing for a week.
I wish you didn't always yell at Tom.
Tom is very ambitious.
I praised him for his diligence.

I like things done properly.
Tom was patient.
I think you should work a little harder.
I'm never late for school.
It's well past Tom's bedtime.
I want to go skiing with Tom.
He was robbed of his youth.
I always see him when he comes to Madrid.
For what purpose?
I'm freaking out.
The ship went through the Suez Canal.
They won't have arrived yet.
English is spoken in America.
You promised that Tom would be here.
Tom didn't know that Mary understood French.

Can you read that?
Tom sounds upset.
Come anytime you like.
This train runs nonstop to Nagoya.
Tom comes from a musical family.
Aren't you happy about this?
It's surprising how many unhappy marriages there are.
My parents were opposed to our marriage.
I'd like to go abroad one day.
Did Tom steal something again?
Tom doesn't want to look.
"If you don't take a vacation, you'll collapse."

I'm not the same fool I was fifteen years ago.
I'd like to make a reservation for next Monday.
Tom said he was having problems with Mary.
"In Japan, we still sometimes see someone use an abacus, but not as often as we used to."
There's nothing we can do about it.
Mary is very gentle with her baby sister.
I didn't look at it.
He quit smoking.
The toy store is closed.
Bergen is the second largest city in Norway.
We have a holiday today.
We can't let Tom get away with it.
The committee members are all men.
I'm here because of Tom.
Do you want another one of these?
Tom showed me a magic trick.
When was the last time you plucked a chicken?
I was half expecting this to happen.
"Excuse me, how much do these cost?"
I'll do the dishes.
I always catch a cold in the winter.
You can't deny it.
I've been waiting for this.
I'd like to take this with me.
I plan to spend the New Year's holiday in Australia.
Can you suggest a better idea?
Why don't you try to behave like a gentleman?
Please feel free to make a suggestion.
There is a lot of furniture in his room.
We are Arabs.
Smoking is permitted.
"Tom was in Australia last month, wasn't he?"
I don't know what Tom wants.
Swimming is easy for me.
The rainy season begins towards the end of June.
I couldn't tell what color his shirt was because it was too dark outside.
The place is worth visiting at least once.
They climbed down the tree.
I think it's a shame that some foreign language teachers were able to graduate from college without ever having studied with a native speaker.
I had fun.
May I ask you some questions about your name?
I don't understand this at all.
Are you sure you want to do that?
Tom used to smoke two packs of cigarettes a day.
Tom isn't listening.
You gave up on me.
"To tell the truth, I didn't do my homework."
They cheat.
This piece is impossible to play.
It wasn't just me who didn't like that movie.
Tom likes French and he's good at it.
He saw suicide as the only way out.
Do you have any idea why that might be?
Tom was crushed.
Tom wants to become rich and famous.
Light the lantern so we can see.
Did you break the window on purpose or by accident?
It could be Tom.
"Yes, it's true, but he doesn't need to know that."
I can hear something.
What mileage do you get with this car?
I'm afraid that won't be enough.
Tom noticed Mary wasn't wearing the ring he'd given her.
A fish can swim.
Tom followed Mary out into the hall.
I saw him go into the toilet a few minutes ago.
Please follow me.
You're a workaholic.
I'm out of breath.
Guess what? Tom and Mary broke up.
You are a doctor.
I wanted to be with you.
Six of us are going on an excursion to the beach this weekend.
They lost no time in leaving their home.
He never saw his mother again.
"To make a long story short, he was fired."
I know this isn't easy.
He drives very fast.
You may swim now.
Do you know Tom's parents?
It's up to you and me.
We agree.
Would you please lock the door?
I lost my way in the woods.
Tom and Mary gathered nuts in the forest.
Tom wanted to get married.
I am fond of Australian food.
I'm a night owl.
The teacher pokes his nose into everything.
What would you like to do while you're here?
Tom has a house with a pool.
It's okay as long as no one finds out about it.
Tom told his children to sit in the back seat.
The mice ate some of the bread.
I'll have to take this with me.
The man swimming in the river is my friend.
Tom doesn't drink beer.
Could it be a virus?
Tom has a secret crush on Mary.
I think that's a lot of hogwash.
This was too much for Tom.
The food disagreed with him.
I don't like that idea much.
Tom knows about that.
They aren't waiting for the bus.
I can't leave you here.
Would you help me clean the bedroom?
What you say is right.
Don't expose this chemical to direct sunlight.
They were terribly upset.
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Can you answer this question?
Tom made a list of things he needed to buy.
Tom could hardly hear what Mary was saying.
I'll say it again.
How long have you been living on this island?
What you say is right.
How do you like Boston?
A beautiful object like that never loses its value.
The kitchen is downstairs.
How did you get so dirty?
What have you decided?
Tom did everything he could.
I left my wife.
He was quickly recaptured.
I am starting this evening.
We can still be friends.
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me?
The suspect is armed and dangerous.
English and German are two related languages.
"After the storm, the sea was quiet again."
Tom can keep a secret.
I saw Tom standing outside a cheap motel.
All you have to do is to make a comment.

You ought to thank him.
The two boys look more alike than I thought.
I never go to Kyoto without visiting the Nanzenji Temple.
You are to come with me.
"We're sorry, but we can't do anything more for you."

I was a little surprised.
My kids have all left school.
Let's have dinner.
Are you taking any medicine regularly?
Does this train have a sleeping car?
Concentrate your attention on this problem.
I won't be able to come tomorrow. I hope you will be able to make it without me.
You are supposed to take off your shoes when entering a house in Japan.
I met him the other day.
Is your dog mean?
You should not go alone.
I don't normally lie.
It was still there.
Don't forget to take out the garbage.
He kept his promise.
I wonder if Tom likes Chinese food.
Tom took a few things out of his suitcase.
You asked us to do that.
Germany then had a powerful army.
You'll have to be more specific.
I don't feel up to playing tennis right now.
The cat crept under the hedge.
Can you teach me how to steal?
Cows give us milk.
How could you leave a four-year-old child all alone?
"I've never told anyone that before, not even my mother."
Let's go to Boston together.

I've asked you several times not to do that.

What did they have to say?
The human body is composed of billions of small cells.
There are millions of stars in the universe.
I don't have time for you.
The piano is expensive.
You never answered the question.
We need to clean the car.
The wind knocked the birdhouse out of the tree.
I spent two hours yesterday trying to fix that broken radio.
I'm one of the thirty people who had to do that.
It was pitch-black.
He looks very good.
You should tell your mother as soon as possible.
Money does not grow on trees.
How else can you account for it?
We're just doing our job.
"You don't listen, do you?"
You'll see it.
My plans failed one after the other.
I hope it will be overlooked this time.
Everyone does it.
You didn't let me finish my sentence.
Tom didn't get a driver's license until he was thirty.
I have a friend in England.
It was very hot this afternoon.
I consider her to be an honest woman.
We should have made a careful plan in advance.
Tom said he was very tired.
I'll be in my office if you need me.
I have insurance.
You can't take it with you.
Tom tried his luck.
I fell asleep.
I admitted that I didn't know what to do.
Sorry for the delay.
It is Paris that I want to visit.
She is quite satisfied with her life as it is.
Take some bottles of water to the meeting room.
I wasn't pleased.
I'm doing OK.
What were Tom and Mary supposed to do?
"You can't understand this sentence, can you?"
Mary doesn't wear makeup.
Don't play games.
Tom resented the fact that Mary got the promotion instead of him.
I live in a rural area.
It probably would be cheaper somewhere else.
May I have a piece of it?
Tom loves fishing.
I regret not having taken my doctor's advice.
I arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
I really need your help.
I think you'll enjoy the picnic.
"If you have questions, ask away."
Tom has been my best friend for a long time.
All my friends like Tom.
I'm friends with everybody.
I lived in Sanda City last year.
Tom is a hard man to deal with.
Do you like looking in the mirror?
Maybe she can tell you more.
I would like to read some books about Lincoln.
I meant to thank you for your help.
I am sneezing.
I thought you would say that.
It wasn't an accident.
That has nothing to do with this problem.
I saw that movie a long time ago.
This is an automatic door.
Why aren't you dancing?
She decided to be a doctor.
My house is your house.
I'm lost. Could you please help me?
Is this going to hurt?
These are for Tom.
We were all present at the party.
There are no tickets left.
A lion is an animal.
He got well again.
I fed my dog what I thought was good quality dog food.
Tom and his friends are playing soccer in the park.
They can't see you.
Something very weird happened to Tom.
I want to see your boss.
I have bad eyesight.
Tom saw John and Mary holding hands.
Tom didn't tell anyone who he really was.
"I have seen ""Star Wars"" twice."
Tom has many enemies.
"You don't give up too easily, do you?"
They murdered Tom.
How did you celebrate New Year's Eve?
Just because you're my girlfriend doesn't mean I have to agree with you.
It's almost impossible to read Tom's handwriting.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom probably didn't even know about the meeting.
You have to take the bull by the horns.
They took a leap of faith.
The actress is studying her role.
What can I help you with?
The text is too long.
What bus do I take to get to Rampa?
I thought it would make you laugh.
Nobody cares for me.
I know exactly what you were going to do.
Tom usually only eats oatmeal for breakfast.
I really appreciate all your help.
It's the same every time.
"Whose knives are these? ""They are the butcher's."""
I had my hair cut at the barber's.
Please say a prayer for those who were onboard.
I've got time.
I've never seen that man before in my life.
"If you do that, you're going to subject yourself to ridicule."
Tom finally changed his name.
I love doing this.
The parking lot is empty.
Tom didn't believe Mary.
The actors appeared in historical costumes.
Who goes there?
Tom hid his weapons.
Don't let it get you down.
You're too young to travel by yourself.
It'll be a waste of time if we wait for them any longer.
That was not the only problem.
"What's wrong? ""I don't have a key."""
I won't sell my soul.
Tom knows that Mary can't speak French.
"Tom eats asparagus, but his brother doesn't."
It took us a week to locate their hideaway.
I got a letter from a friend of mine in London.
What do you want me to do with Tom?
Lightning struck Tom's house.
You're not Canadian.
I'm impressed with how much you've improved.
Ten people were packed into the small room.
Everything that Tom said is true.
An image is worth a thousand words.
Isn't there a better way to do this?
It seems to be working now.
This house needs painting.
"Tom, you'll be here for me if I need you, won't you?"
Do we know for sure it's Tom?
The government is not doing its best to solve the housing problem.
The work has already begun.
You were fortunate to be here.
Tom's teacher called to say that Tom has been bullying a couple of kids at school.
He sometimes makes dinner for us.
You have to learn the basics first.
Tom said that he wants to do everything by himself.
He asked me if I was busy.
My grandmother owns many scarves.
Would you mind if I took a break?
I've told you all of this once already.
Tom will drive you home.
I threw it in the river.
I'll never see her again.
Tom wanted us to attack.
My guess is that Tom is looking for you.
Six families live in this apartment house.
The doctor took my pulse.
He is well known in our country.
Tom can be insufferable at times.
We should be very careful.
He likes walking in the park.
I like science fiction better.
We can't win.
He was a tall man.
Tom is a very good student.
I've learned a lot from you over the past year.
Have you found something?
"Seen from a distance, the big rock looks like an old castle."
What is your opinion on this issue?
There were several couples on the beach.
I do not know anything about him.
Tom told me I should spend more time with my family.
The blade was very sharp.
Mary is talking in her sleep.
I can't remember why I did that.
Please don't go.
My aunt wears glasses when she reads the papers.
It was a lovely sight to see.
You're hurting me.
Take one of these.
That medicine helped a lot.
Tom said that he didn't know Mary could speak French.
Pull me up.
Tom and Mary have gone swimming together a number of times.
Did he ask you to spy on me?
Everyone in town is gossiping about us.
These shoes are not suitable for running.
I'm not sure about that. It depends.
My cat will love this.
The girl did not say anything.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
The family mourned the tragic death of their young child.
I'll call you right after the meeting.
It's obvious that you told a lie.
I want back what you've taken from me.
Step on it!
He was born in 1960.
I'd rather live in a small town than in a big city.
He lives in a luxury apartment close to Central Park.
What we should do next is the question.
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before she left.
"This box is very heavy, so I can't carry it."
The escaped prisoner is still at large.
"Tom has been working here since October 20, 2013."
Tom grabbed his coat and headed for the door.
Today I don't feel like doing anything.
I went swimming in the river.
He let me stay for a night.
Tom is doubtful.
"Would you like a drink? ""I've already got one."""
"Now that we're alone, let's have fun."
No attention was paid to his warning.
Come and help me out.
All the evidence points to his guilt.
You should apologize.
I don't need your help.
I'm going to deal with the problem in this chapter.
You are not at all what I expected.
Tom doesn't go to the movies as often as he'd like to.
This is fine.
I came by bus.
Tom is escaping.
Tom lost consciousness.
You should look after the children from time to time.
It wasn't until I heard him speak that I recognized him.
I have a friend who cuts his own hair.
It's been fun.
I like mathematics.
Did you know that Tom was kidnapped when he was three?
Why are you wearing gloves?
I'm just saying you shouldn't trust Tom.
"And to make matters worse, he met with a traffic accident."
"Hopefully, you will come back."
"Tom was asleep in the hammock, snoring quietly."
Let's take a 10 minute break.
Some people argue that technology has negative effects.
He never wears a tie.
"Well, now you know."
Tom left Boston three weeks ago.
Bring me a clean plate and take the dirty one away.
Tom is only given fifteen minutes to eat his lunch.
"Could you clear the table, please?"
My sister is pretty.
You don't have to work today.
The world's largest telescope is in the Canary Islands.
The problem is not so much the cost as the time.
Dreams come true.
All the church bells started ringing together.
Give me my money back.
I'm not ashamed of what I did.
He works for an American company.
How old are your children now?
We know who they are.
It's not too late.
She proceeded with the work.
I'd like the most inexpensive room you have for four nights.
Today is October 20th.
Let's go grab a burger.
Mary is the cutest girl in the class.
"Without humility, courage is a dangerous game."
That's a fact.
You must really be proud of yourself.
I need a job.
Let's pretend that nothing happened?
I knew you'd make it.
Tom sensed danger.
I'm looking forward to spending time with my family.
I was born there.
I'm leaving today.
You are not allowed to leave the room.
I should have told you everything earlier.
The meeting will have finished by the time we get there.
I'll be there tomorrow.
"Due to the lack of students, the school will be closed at the end of the year."
What are you doing up there?
It isn't suitable for minors.
Why do you speak French so well?
Maybe Tom and Mary just weren't meant to be together.
I was wondering if you knew where Tom was.
You can spend the night if you want to.
She guided me to the palace.
I ruined everything.
Mary said Tom was in trouble.
Please find a solution to the problem.
This novel isn't as good as his last one.
He is a very nice student.
It's not anybody's fault.
Tom and Mary take turns washing the dishes.
I don't know when he'll be here.
I think we have to be very careful.
When are you going to get here?
You have made many mistakes.
Don't look at me.
I have no clue what I'm doing.
"Tom and Mary walked down the path, holding hands."
I won't go back there.
It's an embarrassing question.
Have you seen any movies lately?
My mother has cooked ten eggs.
"You're a good boy, Tom."
What is the name of that river?
That'll complicate matters more.
There was an awkward silence when he appeared.
I will have finished my homework by Tuesday.
Tom loves fishing.
I believe men are basically good.
Tom looked pretty tired.
Would you excuse me a moment?

Do you need our help?

The calendar is hanging on the wall.
Tom has been living in Boston since 2013.
Tom doesn't know what to buy Mary for her birthday.
I believe you have my umbrella.
We'll stop you.
I've been very busy since this morning.
It's not easy for me.
I want to study abroad next year.
Your time is up.
Tom says he really likes his new job.
I don't say it without reason.
The boy fell from the bridge.
It's my horse.
Hold on there.
"If you need anything, ask the chambermaid."
Your lawyers want to see you.
Is Tom sleeping?
Everybody thinks Tom is a bit crazy.
She takes after her mother in every respect.
I have blisters on my feet.
I've given up smoking.
My mother cooks well.
Tom is very smart.
This company doesn't even have a meeting room.
Yours is over there.
I couldn't help but cry.
I know your brother very well.
The water is clean.
Look at what you've done.
I'm ready for anything.
You've got willpower.
He often lets me use his typewriter.
Don't you want to know what this is all about?
"The mountain path was under a blanket of leaves, soft and easy to walk on."
They released the prisoner.
Would like a soda or something?
We walked along a narrow path.
Is that all Tom told you?
Is there a problem I should know about?
It is hardly raining.
"May I speak to Tom Jackson, please?"
You've lost the ability to concentrate.
I think I know where Tom is.
Tom has cerebral palsy.
Have you been to London?
Tom doesn't like it when Mary criticizes him in public.
Tom died three months later.
I think we're all a bit crazy.
I'll be back as soon as I find Tom.
We all need to work together.
My father quit drinking.
Tom shot himself.
It is no use trying to solve this problem.
He will arrive within an hour.
May I introduce myself to you?
I am a teacher.
"She is a beauty, admittedly, but she has her faults."
Can I stay here tonight?
Tom has a small farm just outside of Boston.
It's redundant.
Tom read it for me.
Tom and Mary kept their marriage a secret.
There's nothing left to be done.
Her courage supported her.
I don't know you anymore.
Tom kissed the tip of Mary's nose.
I'm a huge fan of golf.
How old were you then?
You made a horrible mistake.
I hope to see you the next time you are in Tokyo.
I'd like to check your blood pressure.
I never imagined we'd end up like this.
"All of a sudden, all the lights went out."
You must do as you are told.
Tom asked me if I were happy.
I met him the day before yesterday.
Tom and Mary meet in downtown Boston once a month.
I only hope we're not too late.
I'll never doubt you again.
He slipped while crossing the street.
I no longer want to live in Boston.
He reminds me of my grandfather.
Tom sent Mary home.
You said you loved Tom.
I haven't washed my hair.
Call Tom and tell him I can't meet him this afternoon.
You're fifteen minutes early.
"No matter how busy you are, you have to do your homework."
There is the train at 10 o'clock.
Tom owns a hunting rifle.
Tom never drives over the speed limit.
They told me that the cemetery is in terrible condition.
He has a small advantage.
He may have been right.
I've only just started studying French.
We should drink 64 ounces of fluids a day.
Does Tom know about this?
I can't hide my feelings.
You seem disappointed.
Does Tom believe in miracles?
I'm glad to see you again.
I've already drunk half a bottle of wine while I was waiting for you.
You can't force me to go.
What's Tom looking at?
You rarely ever wake up this early.
Tom doesn't seem to be unhappy today.
The toy department is on the fifth floor.
How in the world did you find me?
I wonder how Tom managed to park his car in such a small space.
Salted monkey nuts are popular in many parts of the world.
I remember his face but I can't remember his name.
Don't say things like that.
Only Tom didn't want to go.
When will you call?
I'm just writing a letter to my girlfriend.
They pitched their tents on the beach.
Show him how to do this.
How do you think we can help Tom?
My old job was extremely boring.
It may be important.
I plan on skipping lunch.
"Machines may one day think, but they'll never laugh."
Only I could answer the question correctly.
Please write down your name.
My neck hurts.

They are peace-loving people.
What you are saying doesn't make sense.
All you have to do is to wait for her reply.
Mother and I are different in every way.
You're uninteresting.
Tom felt uneasy.
How was the French class?
We don't have to go anywhere.
Do you have any tape?
I really enjoyed your company.
Thank you for coming early.
I was so unhappy then.
That did me good.
I was also impressed with the school's cleanliness and the students' pride in it.
Tom refused to tell us what had happened.
She's promised to give me a ring.
He knows how to spend his money.
That's not what I wanted hear.
Tom went to an all-boys boarding school.
Why is everybody so worried about Tom?
I'll take my father's place.
How do you feel about what she said?
I lost my camera.
Tom loves chili.
Is Tom bluffing?
We lost sight of him.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.

Can you take a break?
He was very old.
The bishop took pity on the desperate immigrants.
This factory produces 500 automobiles a day.
I've worked with Tom for three years.
That's upsetting.

You'll go to school tomorrow.
The temperature has suddenly dropped.
There is enough bread for all of you.
We hope you will enjoy the show.
We danced all night long.
I'll get Tom for you.
I thought his opinion was relevant.
"You freaked out, didn't you?"
We've been looking in the wrong places.
This mule can't carry a heavier load.
How long'll that take?
"He didn't divulge the information, not even under pain of torture."
"If you don't leave right now, I'll call security."
My mother makes the best cakes in the world.
Are you OK with this?

There's still plenty that needs to be done.
Tom said that he thought Mary knew who John hoped would win the election.
Tom will probably be here all afternoon.
What's the scariest thing that ever happened to you?
I can't risk getting captured again.
Tom sleeps on his back.
"Suppose your father saw us together, what would he say?"
Tom and Mary were very close.
She is attractive.
I didn't say a single word.
That was well worth the trouble.
There's no point in denying it anymore.
There are no women here.
When was the last time you missed the train?
He owes his success to his parents.
I didn't buy that car.
I go to the movies once in a while.
Tom didn't show up for the meeting.
Tom said he had some personal problems to take care of.
She wants him.
Tom may do whatever he wants to.
Everyone was satisfied.
Would you recognize Tom?
We all make mistakes.
Show this gentleman the way.

We need to discuss the situation.

African elephants have less hair than Asian elephants.
Tom's house is tidy.
We're a family.
How did it all come about?
Tom runs a company in Boston.
"Different people believe in different things, but there is only one truth."
A lot still remains to be done.
I knew you'd come after me.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John asks her to do.
I would like to know how much it costs.
We only use our basement for storage.
I'll fix you something to eat while you take a shower.
Tom has three sisters and an older brother.
Tom is ambidextrous and can use his right hand equally as well as his left.
We have to protect our children.
Put it where children can't get at it.
I'm glad to hear that.
I swim in the sea every day.
The police think Tom has been kidnapped.
We agreed.
The work has already begun.
Your order has been carried out.
"I, too, am a teacher."
We watched a new program on television.
I can assure you we'll never make that mistake again.
I had my reasons.
He is the richest man on earth.
"That's good, too."
"Come on everyone, let's dance!"
Don't ask too many questions.
Tom wants to be at home.
I'm impressed with how well you speak French.
Do you like Moscow?
Please don't go out of your way on my account.
That story is a famous one that everyone knows.
I'll try to keep up with you.
How will you stop him?
Tom didn't want anything to do with Mary.
"In a minute, I'm going to tell you my life story."
Have you told him yet?
Tom's embarrassed.
It was in this room that we had the meeting last Friday.
I believe Tom knows.
Tom noticed that Mary was sitting in the corner by herself.
We're not killers.
Whose side is Tom on?
It's more trouble than it's worth.
What was his name again?
He asked her to call him later.
I don't want to be shot.
He's a man we can trust.
Tom is looking for Mary now.
How many guitars do you own?
I'm sure I saw her two years ago.
How is your father?
We may meet again in the near future.
Tom got the children to laugh.
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
What is your opinion on this matter?
Is this a new car?
I barely got out of there alive.
You must not stay here.
I asked Tom a question.
Tom is excused.
Clean that up.
Tom stopped taking his pills.
Who is the person in charge?
Tom used to live next door to me.
Tom and Mary were too tired to argue with each other.
There was a commotion when store security guards detained some young men for shoplifting.

She's the most beautiful woman in the world.
Atoms cannot be seen with your own eye.
He is superior to his competitors in everything.
How much does he earn in a month?
I still have an hour or so before my next appointment.
"I'd love to go with you to the show, but I'm flat broke."
I have to go there.
I was very scared.
I waited until the last minute.
You need not have come here so early.
That's never stopped you before.
That sounds fishy to me.
I think death is preferable to shame.
Would you like white wine or red?
Have a nice day.
"There is little, if any, hope of his being alive."
I want a lot more.
This book isn't as heavy as that one.
There's narrow road to the village.
Will it rain tomorrow?
He lost sight of that bird.
Something's not right.
The reasons Tom gave for doing that weren't very good.
The ship changed its course.
You're confused.
Are we doing this correctly?
It's really windy.
I can wait no longer.
Why didn't you get married?
How did you come to hear that?
Do it yourself by all means.
You never understand anything.
Tom is a football player.
Are you absolutely certain about this?
Did the dog bark?
Tom and his family live in Boston.
You can't keep Tom from going to work today.
I recognized Tom.
She is ashamed to speak up.
She found it dull living in the country.
Is lunch included in this price?
Mary is 36 weeks pregnant.
She speaks clearly enough to be easily understood.
Tom wants to kiss Mary at midnight.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Do you want the job or not?
We can't last long in this heat.
All I can do at the moment is sit here and listen.
We saw monkeys at the zoo.
I was embarrassed.
What's your asking price?
You should stay at home today.
I have an invitation.
I'd never suggest that.
Tom promised me that.
It was pretty obvious.
I didn't think you were going to make it.
What's this for?
Tom and Mary's little boy loves sitting on the kitchen floor banging pots and pans.
Tom told me a really funny joke this morning.
She is able to speak ten languages.
My baby brother sleeps ten hours a day.
Tom put his clothes in the suitcase.
War may break out at any moment.
You remind me of Tom.
I thought Tom was at school.
I really don't want anything to eat right now.
This newspaper has no political slant.
I've been fired.
The two of us are finally alone.
Mercury has a very thin atmosphere.
"Why are you a cop, Tom?"
The soldiers were equipped with weapons.
The kid is a pain in the neck.
Tom pleaded guilty and is now in prison.
He'll never beat me.
I love Korean food.
"Tom pulled into his garage, turned off the engine, and then got out of the car."
I can't tell you any more about it.
Keep walking.
I don't care what it is.
Do you like your car?
I think it might help if you'd talk to Tom yourself.
I like poets like Takuboku.
Choose one person.
"Farther on, we came upon a house."
The chickens were killed by a fox.
They were satisfied with the result.
I don't know what I want.
I would never have guessed that Tom couldn't swim.
The room is warming up.
"You lost, didn't you?"
"A Chinese farmer was told not to shave before the visit of President Hu Jintao, so that he would look ""more rustic"" on TV."
This is the lady who wants to see you.
I study English at home.
Tom is always short of money.
We're not terrorists.
I fished in the Thames River.
It's truly frightening.
Prepare yourself.
She undertook the responsibility for the project.
Tom looks healthier than he used to.
Give me a break here.
Dreams sometimes come true.
I love the sound of wind chimes.
I have Tom's keys.
Why are girls so cute?
Bring your children along.
Tom was in a bad mood.
Tell her to call me.
The old man predicted our success.
I'm not as poor as I used to be.
Mary is Tom's wife.
They thanked God.
You were correct.
I think you're ready.
Our living room is sunny.
She's worried about your safety.
I'm sorry I woke you.
Tell me what we're doing here.
Tom was relieved to see Mary.
Tom and Mary talked over a cup of coffee.
Have you ever eaten turkey?
This river is three times longer than that one.
Where did you go with Tom?
Tom saved all of the letters Mary sent him.
He has been engaged in foreign trade for twenty years.
My notebook is pink.
Her beauty drew his attention.
You're not rich.
Either way's fine with me.
Tom picked up a rock and threw it.
I haven't spoken to Tom.
We've finished cleaning the classroom.
Please tell me about your trip.
Birds sing.
White smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel.
He built them on an assembly line.
I'm sorry for not replying to your letter earlier.
They saw Tom.
His family is very large.
Tom likes to observe the people walking by.
Just look at those legs.
I'm really worried that my parents aren't going to like Tom.
There is no satisfactory answer a parent can give to this.
"If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just 500 dollars."
My thirteen year old girl loves to watch romance movies.
I always see him when he comes to Madrid.
Tom told me you only want two hundred dollars for your guitar.
They were both drunk.
Where would Tom go?
Mary loves shopping for clothes.
I didn't want that.
That man's not to be trusted.
I wanted to marry him.
"If it rains tomorrow, I won't go."
Will you send it by mail?
He's jealous and irrational.
Tom watched Mary work.
They live across the river.
I want facts.
He's intelligent.
"Concerning this matter, I'm the one to blame."
We got involved in a traffic accident.
You shouldn't say such rude things to him.
I've just learned the news.
I have to go back to work now.
I appreciate you telling me.
He got a good grade in mathematics.
Tom tried not to smile.
Good for you.
Who's the girl in a yellow raincoat?
This parcel is addressed to you.
Have you told your mother?
Tom didn't tell me much about it.
The boy is clinging to his mother.
North Korea decided the time was right to invade.
We got to the station at six.
He takes his time when he works.
Take off your wet clothes.
Mom bought a pretty doll for me.
"Please tell me what's wrong, Tom."
I didn't see him again after that.
Tom and Mary have actually never been on a date yet.
Tom has asthma.
Could you do me a big favor?
Did you steal it?
I'm happy to hear it.
How many people did you invite?
Are you afraid of a little girl?
Do you often travel abroad?
I don't need advisers.
I need those shoes.
Let's just make the best of it.
Do you want me to wait?
You must be careful.
It didn't end well.
Can I help you?
He accepted her gift.
How many bags do you have?
We went down a river by canoe.
I received your letter the day before yesterday.
Why do you care what other people think?
I'm in pain.
That's the most important thing I've learned from you.
We've got to help those who can't help themselves.
No one would've remembered Tom if he hadn't painted his name on the ceiling of the classroom.
He asked me if I had slept well the night before.
I played tennis after I studied.
How do you think Tom does it?
I really want to see Tom.
We defeated the enemy.
We were both hungry.
Tom found it.
What part of Australia are you from?
It just doesn't work that way.
Tom was tempted to tell Mary the truth.
Not that I have any objection.
My dog is big.
He was elected mayor of the city.
I've heard nothing.
Tom is waiting for you at the front door.
I asked Tom to explain.
Don't act surprised.
Tom was good at playing the violin.
Tom hugged me.
The old man lives by himself.
We stayed at home because it was very cold.
That's exactly what we did.
We actually saw the accident.
Do you think I want this?
You can't outrun that bear.
Let me have a taste.
I spoke slowly so that they could understand me.
I would've said yes.
Tom wears glasses.
Why is he hiding under the table?
We've got better things to do with our time.
He was shy at first.
The darkest hour is just before the dawn.
Do you have the most recent version of this software?
Tom played a few tunes on the piano.
"This book costs 3,000 yen."
"Foreigners are interesting, aren't they?"
Why is the parking lot so slippery?
Attack is the best form of defense.
It was impolite of him to do so.
He ran into the classroom.
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
How come you didn't call me last night?
"She requested help, but no one came."
"You were too smart for me, Tom."
I'm not going to touch it.
She must have been very beautiful.
"We love her, and she loves us, too."
Why do we have to help Tom?
Did you draw this yourself?
The beach is an ideal place for children to play.
Tom has a room at the hotel near the river.
Tom usually eats his lunch alone.
Tom says Mary is lying about where she was last night.
You may take my word for it.
We have two lessons in the afternoon.
I can't stand being contradicted.
"That's not very good, is it?"
What are your favorite books?
Tom relented.
We have not heard from him since last year.
Was I supposed to buy something for you on my way home?
Tom and Mary are sitting in the living room talking.
No one knows his real name.
Is there something in particular that you want to eat?
He is a woman hater.
He has bought a new car.
Her son's death broke her heart.
This is a sign.
Tom is the one who told me that I should study French.
Ask her if she'll sew up the hole in your jeans.
We would be very pleased if you paid us a visit.
The wheat is ready for harvest.
We'll have to deal with it.
I just want to go home and sleep.
You're useless.
It is pitch dark.
He'll be glad to see you.
"I don't trust anyone, not even Tom."
Sunday is the first day of the week.
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.
Should I see a specialist?
The teacher pointed out the grammatical errors made by the students.
Mary's not happy that her boyfriend has to kiss another girl for the school play.
My father's going to kill me.
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
I'll pick Tom up in an hour.
What's Tom asking?
Could you please translate this for me?
The only access to the farmhouse is across the fields.
You can't always get the one you want.
It was really nice meeting you.
I'm sensing a little hostility here.
Tom confessed to the robbery.
It's only a temporary solution.
Thanks for ironing my clothes for me.
Tom will manage.
Don't you sleep well at night?
We're counting on you to help.
She quit school for health reasons.
Old habits are hard to break.
Tom is wrong.
This is not enough.
Don't talk about this to anyone.
The girl playing the piano is my daughter.
I fell into a hole.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Tom has three weeks of paid vacation.
Tom explained his decision.
You're really gorgeous.
Are we leaving now?
Tom lay down in the grass and looked at the stars.
Tom rode the roller coaster.
Don't you dare touch that.
He doesn't know what to do with his money.
We'd better leave her alone.
The trip was canceled because of the terrible storm.
Why do they want me?
It would take forever for me to explain everything.
Tom hanged himself in his jail cell.
The next meeting will take place in a few days.
When will it begin?
This is not for me.
Make sure that the dog does not escape.
"I can play chess, but I can't play checkers."
"Could you repeat that, please?"
"Tom is really unlucky, isn't he?"
He wrote to his parents.
How was your flight?
Do you know who I am?
Tom wouldn't talk to Mary.
Don't you remember who gave you that?
I'm scared of dogs.
You're not trying hard enough.
I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother.
No one can stop us now.
Mary is quite snobby.
My older sister is good at singing.
I've never given it a second thought.
He lost all his possessions.
Everyone screamed.
"Be gentle, but firm."
There was dead silence.
I'm OK.
Do you know how to whistle?
I thought it was a bottle.
I knew it was wrong.
We're going to have a test today.
I would rather quit than work under him.
War must be avoided at all costs.
Tsunamis swept through rice fields and flooded the towns.
What I really want to do is to ask Mary for a divorce.
Don't feed the animals.
I teach French.
Come and see me soon.
Guys are supposed to respect girls.
Tom is handcuffed.
How are you feeling?
"This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday."
The blood alcohol limit for drunken driving is .08 percent in Texas.
Tom and I sat next to each other on the plane.
I have to give the money back to Tom.
Tom wasn't nice.
She thanked him for all his help.
I'm in my car.
We met through a mutual friend.
Tom's methods were unorthodox.
Why did Tom give you that?
You would have failed without his help.
Tom told Mary about his plan.
Would you like to have a cup of tea?
I wondered why Tom was absent from school.
Hope is not a strategy.
Write down your name here.
Tom doesn't read.
Mary is extremely beautiful.
I heard it hasn't changed.
I don't know what you want to do.
Tom said Mary is at home.
He had his car stolen in that parking lot.
"If this is your knife, then I have lost mine."
Tom quickly got dressed.
It will never happen again. I swear.
"When I was about to leave my house, I got a phone call from her."
I don't want any popcorn.
We're like family.
We'll continue.
Those are my pants.
Tom is a very good man.
I left my new pair of gloves in the library.
Go away!
They helped Tom.
May I pay with a credit card?
That is not a proper subject to bring up in conversation at the dinner table.
You're not young anymore.
"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
We're in third place.
Leave them alone.
The sun had already risen when I woke up.
About how much money do you have?
Tom took a picture of himself and sent it to his girlfriend.
I am sure this book will be of great use to you.
JST stands for Japan Standard Time.
The precise time of their arrival is not known.
Make sure the stepladder is firm.
The snake swallowed a frog.
What is going on here?
Tom walks his dog at least once a day.
Could I have some of your beer?
I was alone.
Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong.
I thought that you'd recognize Tom.
He was covered all over with white paint.
"According to Tom, Mary killed herself."
That's your seat.
When is this crisis going to be over?
Tom never spoke to Mary again.
Tom broke into the deserted shack.
The big question is why.
Reading is to the mind what food is to the body.
That's a joke.
They will be safe with her.
Tom's bicycle was blue before he painted it red.
Who's after you?
I only speak French at home with my parents.
This English novel is not easy enough for you to read in a week.
We ordered 40 minutes ago.
I'm a black belt in karate.
Tom lowered the bucket into the well.
The weather yesterday was horrible.
You're the prettiest woman I've ever seen.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
Yokohama is a beautiful port town.
I'll go and see Tom.
I didn't buy the book.
Tom is too stupid to be scared.
I refused at first.
I'll be there Monday.
It seemed that he was short of money.
Will you use this?
It happens more often than you would think.
"I'm sorry, I'm busy right now."
What does it taste like?
Compare this copy with the original.
Did you write this book?
Save it till later.
I would never lie to you.
Where did you pick up that accent?
Do you know what you've done?
I'm trying to find the person who owns this guitar.
I need you.
Tom and Mary ate a six-course meal together.
You should be able to walk in a few days.
I'll be very happy if I can serve you.
The meeting will be postponed till the 20th of this month.
I don't recall asking you for help.
This book says the earliest man-made bridges date back to the New Stone Age.
Tom saw Mary coming towards him.
She lifted up her head and looked at him.
"Could you break a 1,000 yen note?"
Tom arrived just in time to catch the train.
Don't be so modest.
That's free.
I'm not what I used to be.
Shall I prepare you a warm meal?
Tom climbed up so high that we couldn't see him.
Did your mother use to play the piano when she was younger?
I'll get to that in a moment.
He decided to feed his dog the rabbit that he had shot earlier that day.
Don't talk to me!
Would you say Mary is attractive?
I know it's not as easy as it looks.
He is contented with his lot.
Lack of money brought my travel plans to an end.
Tom is a very outgoing person.
The ship was at sea.
Here's the key.
Speaking the truth is not a crime.
I think Tom went to Harvard.
"Listen to me, OK?"
Sit down and shut up.
Who is this woman?
The train is made up of fifteen cars.
Tom is in a good mood.
I don't know how to use this.
Tom will return at 2:30.
I don't know if this is the right thing to do or not.
Have you ever tried not being rude to people?
She danced with him.
Tom told everyone that he thought Mary would make a good wife for someone someday.
I wish we had your problems.
She invited him to her party.
Get off this ship right now.
That's the most beautiful ship I've ever seen.
Now I recognize you.
Few people noticed her absence from the party.
The train arrived on time.
Her husband wants to have his own way in everything.
Tom was unmarried.
We should do away with this regulation.
I got sick last week.
Tom says that he has no trouble understanding Mary's French.
I'm getting married.
Draw a circle.
Everybody laughed at the boy.
Tom changed his mind at the last minute.
We need your help.
Tom was my great-great-great-grandfather.
The problem is what we should do with this money.
Do you want to risk that?
Tom was struck by lightning.
Tom wondered what he was supposed to do.
"In 1994, there was a shortage of water and rice in Japan."
He is tired of reading.
Tom stole Mary's lunch money.
"He gave me 10,000 yen."
We are excited about the move to the new building.
Tom has bad eyesight.
Tom doesn't drive as carefully as I do.
I didn't know that song.
Don't be so greedy or you'll wind up with nothing.
I've got great news for you.
Your friend's in the other room.
Tom came to play.
Why didn't you just pay Tom?
You must've been wrong.
"After we had eaten, we went outside to skate."
I'm at the airport now.
Is Tom at home now?
He's better at the piano than I am.
All of the tree's leaves turned yellow.
Neither of us got our wish.
Tom concealed the fact that he had been in prison.
Tom is angry with me.
Did you close the window?
This pond isn't deep enough to swim in.
I'm saying no.
Don't risk everything you've worked for.
You have to account for your absence.
Don't you remember anything?
Got it?
Tom and Mary are unbeatable at tennis.
What was the result?
We don't have time to do that today.
Many plants bloom in the spring.
Tom couldn't believe that no one laughed at his jokes.
That's how we do it in Boston.
I can't tell you how thrilled I am.
I don't feel like telling her the truth.
I thought you'd left.
I know you better than your wife does.
Go home. Get some rest.
What are the chances Tom will actually come?
I think he wants you to notice him.
Many railroads have been replaced by highways.
Do you have any cheaper rooms?
I didn't understand what Tom said in French.
Tom would like to see you.
Where is the mate to this sock?
Will I be able to get it before then?
Tom says he always told Mary the truth.
Tom drank coffee while Mary smoked a cigarette.
"I ran as fast as I could, but I missed the train."
You should take a canteen full of water with you.
It's very effective.
"Tom is partially right, isn't he?"
My friend has arrived.
How about something cold to drink?
She was stupid to make such a mistake.
We were best friends.
That looks expensive.
I can't stand loud music.
A new student came into the class.
The understanding of the present is impossible without a good understanding of the past.
The second lesson is very simple.
They went outside.
I hope we don't starve to death.
He was challenged to a drinking contest.
The wind blew her hat off.
I just found out last week.
I go to work every day.
Don't overexert yourself.
"When I was your age, I had a girlfriend."
This restaurant has been here a long time.
Tom easily won.
What does he want to do?
She's eight years old.
I'd prefer not to get home until after 2:30.
He is a clever boy.
I'll inform Tom.
I'm in a bad mood.
Tom seems to prefer spending most of his time alone.
There is a picture on the wall.
You could lead.
Tom was surprised.
We are with you.
I'll return at 6:30.
Isn't that childish?
I want you to come to Boston.
They stepped a few paces forward.
Tom tried to pick up his keys with his toes.
Please bill me.
You are working too hard. Take it easy for a while.
I want to know how Tom thinks.
What have you gotten us into?
Her old bike squeaked as she rode down the hill.
Tom looks a little annoyed.
My father made me wash the car.
I'm thinking about something else.
They're in the garden.
Is that all you want to know?
What's that you're working on?
He blushed with shame.
There were many ambulances filled with gunshot victims.
I'd like to make more money.
I don't feel like studying.
I have not finished my homework yet.
"I think I'm right, but I'm not going to fight about it."
We found him bound and gagged.
That's where I'll be.
It's a necessary evil.
The ocean is really big.
I saw the film and found it interesting.
The same thing happened three years ago in Boston.
I agree with you absolutely.
How cold is it?
That's not completely accurate.
He stayed in New York for three weeks.
What do they want with Tom?
You need to get out of the house more.
I told you not to turn on the lights.
I hear you have friends in the CIA.
It's getting darker and darker.
How dare you insult my sister!
Tom has to go to work.
I cannot understand what you say.
We have to do it together.
We swam until it got dark.
This was Tom's idea.
Isn't it about time to go home?
Why did I get a C?
"I didn't have to thank Tom, but I did."
My brother died of cancer last year.
It is said that global warming is directly related to carbon dioxide emissions.
Tom couldn't take it any longer.
Leave it to us.
What exactly don't you get?
Tom isn't at home.
There is a gentleman to see you.
The patient is out of danger now.
We don't like violence.
Is it too far to walk?
Do I have to write in ink?
Call the FBI.
Do you need more time?
An up-to-date edition of the encyclopedia will come out next month.
The only reason Tom went to the party was that he expected Mary to be there.
That's exactly what Tom was afraid of.
Thank you so much for inviting me.
Mahjong tiles are very beautiful.
Tom said that he was extremely tired.
It sounds like someone is crying.
"On Sundays, the museum is not open."
Please tell me how to get to the airport.
Getting down this mountain will take about three hours.
Make it smaller.
Roger Miller died of lung cancer in 1992.
It wasn't what we wanted.
"It takes a lot of money to do that, doesn't it?"
The meat smells terrible.
I am taking a bath now.
You can't talk to me like this.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
I can not put up with his insults any longer.
I find her manner a little hard to take.
My father may be at home now.
Come here and give me a hug.
I think I like it.
We complained about the poor service.
That's my stuff.
Tom is Mary's chauffeur.
Few students could understand what he said.
I hope that no one saw you coming in here.
Tell me why you aren't planning on going to Australia with us.
Tom seldom wins.
Let's go to my office.
I slept aboard the ship.
This word is still in use.
Don't trust anyone.
Tom is wearing John's pajamas.
"At seven-thirty, we too closed the door behind us."
They're with me.
Her beauty will fade in time.
Tom has never been in love.
Tom remembered the rabbits he used to raise.
Tom doesn't drive as fast as Mary.
I'll live with the consequences.
I can't help you with this.
They pay Tom well.
It is their right to vote.
She asked me if I was all right.
I'll never be as good as Tom.
One of the dogs is alive.
One is Japanese and the other is Italian.

That one's OK.
Tom put his briefcase on the floor next to his desk.
Are you sure you can do this?
Tom returned one day earlier than expected.
She gave him a piece of paper.
It gets quite cold in the winter.
I wish my problems would all go away.
Identify yourselves!
I water the flowers in the garden every day.
School is out.
Tom's position on this matter is well known.
Are you here to see Tom?
Please wait in the lobby.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Please keep the fire from going out.
Do you like facial hair on men?
I think we made a wrong turn.
I can't reach it.
It is a curse.
"Since I was tired, I went to bed."
What's your favorite kind of book to read?
I want to thank you for all your help.
Tom would like to be reincarnated as a woman.
We didn't reach the summit.
The man was folding and unfolding his arms.
Will it help to say that?
I've been on the city council for five years.
I'll come by bicycle.
Tom was pushing me.
Ancient coins were found inside the mysterious tomb.
"I am happy, she said to herself."
We traveled to Mexico by plane.
He might have lost his way.
Long skirts are in fashion.
I believe that's correct.
I had never seen a windmill until I visited the Netherlands.
He comes to see me nearly every day.
I saw the way you two were looking at each other.
Tom hasn't washed his hair for two weeks.
They shot the film in an actual desert.
I'll call the police.
Three people were slightly injured.
Tom's parents often fight.
Tom had two pairs of skis tied to the roof of his car.
He has the freedom to do what he thinks is right.
Tom had no reason to be angry.
Did you bring the book?
This is exactly what I wanted to see.
I hear you're moving to Australia.
We regard him as the best player on the team.
That's one of my dogs.
I know your names.
Stop being cruel.
There's not a single safe place anymore in Japan.
Tom unfolded the newspaper and started to read it.
He will have no choice but to accept.
He refused to pay.
That red sweater looks good on you.
Set the lamp on the table.
The instinct for survival is innate.
I escaped death.
I can't stand violence.
She advised him where he should stay.
This is one of the best schools in the city.
I can't say that.
I don't have to be here.
Send the bill to me.
The trees were in a row.
He walks his dog every morning.
Tom loves Mary with all his heart.
I hope you'll reconsider.
Can you manage alone?
Gold is more precious than iron.
She baked three cakes.
Tom only wears brand-name clothes.
I read a most interesting novel yesterday.
Tom can't talk to you right now.
"The earth is round, not flat."
What happened afterwards?
Most car accidents occur due to the inattention of the driver.
He doesn't like being told what to do.
She looked puzzled at the abrupt question posed by a reporter.
How would they find out?
I'm sick of hospitals.
I'm used to being ignored by my parents.
He makes life miserable for everyone around him.
Do you really believe in ghosts?
Tom sat down on the sofa.
He helped the lady into the car.
I expect that Tom won't do what you want him to do.
"You can still swim quite well, can't you?"
It was impossible for him to solve the problem.
I need more time to prepare.
I understand why you're here.
Do you know how to grind beef?
I'll be happy to go.
The speed with which we forget is just unbelievable.
Put yourself in my position.
We won the battle.
Does a child's musical talent depend on heredity?
He often went fishing on Sundays when the weather was good.
The weather is so oppressive.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I would rather stay at home than go out on such a cold day.
I can defeat any chess player.
I was waiting for you.
Lay the book on the table.
We'll stop you.
Many people were waiting in line.
Which house do you live in?
He took off his hat.
They offered assistance.
German Shepherds are good at sniffing out drugs.
This car was so cheap that he could buy it.
Can you swim?
It might be too late.
Spaghetti is one of my specialties.
I can't think about this right now.
The man at the door wouldn't tell me his name.
Do your children speak French?
Tom said he'd get home by 2:30.
Tom didn't want to talk with Mary.
I love weddings.
My grandfather on my father's side is celebrating his 88th birthday tomorrow.
I quit smoking a year ago.
She celebrated her fifteenth birthday yesterday.
"When my bicycle hit the rock, the front tire blew out."
He thinks he's a genius.
Tom and I have written several books together.
I'm an officer.
My book is very heavy.
Tom has a car.
I was asked to wait here.
She's not a good person.
You don't drink enough water.
"Tom, why can't you just accept the facts?"
When is your school festival?
It seems that you don't want me to succeed.
Could you please overlook it this time?
That's where I want to be.
They were going to shoot Tom.
How much money have you got?
Don't do it again.
I'd never expected to meet her in a place like that.
Is Tom available?
Why can't you just be honest?
I saw him wash the car.
I am in a bind as my money has been stolen.
I'm going to tell you everything.
You must take into account the fact that she was ill.
I'd like to lose some weight.
I don't know what you want and I don't care.
I considered changing my job.
You don't have to come.
It's too risky.
Tom was dumbstruck.
Don't try to blame this all on me.
I don't think Tom is capable of doing that.
Tom had no idea how tired Mary was.
I'm absolutely sure!
He went to Boston by car.
Let us out.
"In Venice, there are always lots of tourists."
I don't know what to do.
Do you remember how we met?
Do you believe that good always triumphs over evil?
Tom and Mary can't stand each other.
I miss my mom.
Do you have anything else to say?
I killed them both.
I studied English for two hours after dinner.
There is a rumor that gold has been found in the valley.
What are your plans?
Be careful.
I'm just trying to figure out why someone would do such a thing.
I have some money with me.
Tom was hit by a truck and died instantly.
This question is difficult to answer.
He wishes to become a doctor.
Tom could feel nothing at all.
What is it you're afraid of?
I advise you not to do that.
"Tom is lying on his back, staring at the ceiling."
She went to the hospital by taxi.
I can't get her out of my mind.
Tom noticed that he and Mary were finally alone together.
I wasn't sure what to say.
I've only just started studying French.
It's not blood. It's tomato sauce.
I keep a dog.
Tom asked Mary what kind of movies she liked to watch.
We lost our cat and Tom found it for us.
Tom kept his hat on to hide his baldness.
That boy over there looks about the same age as you.
I want you to find out about Tom.
Were you spying on me?
The hostages will be released.
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday.
I'll wait for you in the car.
He knows how to lock this door.
There's a traitor among us.
Girls don't like you.
You should work hard.
Could you please wait just couple of minutes?
I feel worse today.
Tom started moaning in pain.
Tom wanted to be a writer.
This is complicated.
He is a doctor.
"The more I sleep, the less I feel like working."
I am completely against it.
Does that make you happy?
"The girl, closing her eyes, listened to the pastor."
Who am I talking to?
I'm looking for a job.
Tom knocked on the door and Mary answered it.
Why do you always talk about Tom?
Enjoy your evening.
Tom will arrive in Boston tomorrow morning.
Explain yourself.
Do you like sports?
I usually get up at six.
It isn't easy to understand his ideas.
She's probably ashamed of her apartment.
Do you agree with this?
The meaning of this sentence is obscure.
She ignored him all day.
I admire your optimism.
Tom is wearing a new pair of shoes.
I ran across an old friend near the bank.
This book is out of print.
Tom is a slow walker.
You'll need a flashlight.
What are your wishes?
Thanks for the information.
I'm not jealous of Tom.
You should have prepared for the lesson.
The mayor presented him with the key to the city.
You are responsible for this accident.
He kept silent for a while.
Both of the students passed all their tests.
Tom has done that.
I'm meeting Tom for dinner. Do want to come?
This is a very important meeting.
I can't believe Tom was an undercover cop.
I have a boiled egg for breakfast every day.
Have you ever noticed how unhappy Tom seems to be?
Tom spent the afternoon messing around in his garage.
Tom and Mary weren't particularly kind to me.
My hobby is collecting watches.
Tom is as tall as me.
This bed is too hard to sleep in.
Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Take a bus.
I heard the news that there had been a big earthquake in Awaji.

I despised Tom.
What makes you think I'm going to follow Tom?
Tom made a mountain out of a molehill.
You must not stay in bed.
Tom decided to become a monk.
Tom wasn't at home.
I want to watch television.
I can't share that information with you.
I didn't think you'd believe me.
Tom got along with everybody.
I'd like to have more time to talk with you.
He didn't agree to my proposal.
I don't care for eggs.
I want the recipe for this. It's delicious.
He showed little interest in books or music.
Where did you take your gloves off?
Would you like some of those cookies?
Have you ever seen a car accident?
I think they saw us.
We'll be watching you.
Do you mind their coming too?
"As the crow flies, it's about 20 miles from here."
Cold weather and insects destroyed their crops.
You are very beautiful.
I have Tom on the line.
Some people seem to agree with you.
You should've told me earlier.
Are you bored right now?
"If the phone rings again, I will ignore it."
Shame on you for lying.
Tom wondered where he was supposed to sit.
Everything went better than I had expected.
My son can already count up to one hundred.
"Tom has long, curly hair."
Where did I put it?
She left her umbrella in the train.
Is this the best you can do?
The plane took off at 2:30.
I love vanilla ice cream.
We have a mutual friend.
Tell us the story from beginning to end.
Did you cut the paper?
Metaphors aren't meant to be taken literally.
Do you know him at all?
Don't disturb me!
"As far as I know, he is reliable."
Tom sees Mary three times a week.
He didn't say a word.
He's very lonely.
I had not been waiting long before I heard footsteps coming upstairs.
It's been ages since we last met.
I'm impressed with how well you speak French.
Anybody can do this.
He earned his living as a teacher.
It's junk. Throw it away.
Why doesn't your dog wear a muzzle?
I heard you got engaged.
Are you recording this?
We'll be here all day.
Is that your mom?
Tom said he thought that Mary needed at least $300 to buy what she needed.
Did you speak to Tom yesterday?
I'm a fan of German opera.
Be careful. It's very inflammable.
Tom has been a close friend of mine for a long time.
She kept on talking.
We don't have any drinking water.
What does this have to do with me?
Give Tom whatever he wants.
We should all help provide starving people with food.
You'd better go to bed at once.
You don't seem to be very happy.
I thought that you'd find it interesting.
You and I make a good team.
I know the feeling.
Tom's house is within walking distance of the nearest train station.
That's a useful piece of information.
I get the feeling that I've heard that somewhere before.
Mary is a very pretty girl.
They have a lot in common.
Tom has tried to kill himself again.
Tom visits Mary every time he's in Boston.
Do you want to go fishing with me?
I'm free today.
Tom is a dedicated family man.
Tom was highly educated and spoke several languages fluently.
Stay with us for a few days.
I've already had a coffee.
I have nothing to say to any of you.
They made me go there.
Let's go somewhere private.
You have to try again.
There is a connection between smoking and lung cancer.
You're even more naive than I thought.
I caught him in the act.
Everyone is talking about it.
The answer is completely wrong.
He lives far away from my house.
I thought you understood.
Tom said he thought Mary's suggestion was good.
I think we should have Tom do that for us.
Does it work?
I'm looking for a job.
Tom isn't doing that the way he should be.
Make yourselves comfortable. We have plenty of time.
When will we arrive in Tokyo?
Scientists can easily compute the distance between planets.

Japan is in Asia.
Did you mean it?
Tom ripped off the band-aid.
"I have two sisters, both of whom are married."
"When her mother came, she pretended to be studying."
I tried to put an end to the quarrel.
She bought a pair of boots.
The maid hasn't made up the room yet.
Tom is a world-famous conductor.
She's happy.
He looked at her angrily.
This was meant as a joke.
You had better not read this book.
Tom went to a family reunion last weekend.
I'm sure Tom will get over it.
Mom is making a cake.
She wanted to wash the dirty clothes.
Don't worry.
We're now about a hundred miles away from Boston.
We can't go back to Boston.
I'm proud to be Canadian.

Reading this book was really worthwhile.
We're nearly out of time.

What do you know about the CIA?
What did you hope to accomplish?

Just put those packages anywhere.
Speak to the manager of the firm.
I can't make it alone.
Was the door locked?
He has no idea that I'm coming.
Tom needed someone to help him.
Tom wants to work in a factory.
"All right, I'll do it."
What is the name of that bird?
They eat fish on Fridays.
Tom went down to the lobby to meet Mary.
I did what Tom asked me to do.
He's not a team player.
Keep your eye on the ball.
Tom begged for mercy.
I haven't seen Tom in 2 months.
Mary sings best of all of the girls in class.
They were destined never to meet.
What did you think it was?
That's all for today.
I'd like you to assist Tom.
The tree was felled with one hard blow of his ax.
You're too inflexible.
I'm not an expert in this field.
The island has a fine harbor.
It's a full moon.
Tom told me he had skipped breakfast.
Can all your children speak French?
The teacher gave us a lot of homework.
He isn't able to do it.

What do you think it's for?
They're in Boston.
I was too shy.
I love the way you dress.
The soldiers lowered their weapons.
Tom found out where Mary was.
The whereabouts of the suspect is still unknown.
Tom didn't have enough time to finish his homework.
"If you did that for me, it would help a lot."
Tom looked miserable.
Tom couldn't unlock the door because he had the wrong key.
He made it clear that he had nothing to do with the matter.
It's in the fridge.
I need to search for my pen.
Can you help us find Tom?
Tom speaks relatively fast.
Don't take too long.
Tom said he has to go.
Ulaanbaatar is the capital of Mongolia.
I miss talking with you.
We listened to her for some time.
Why didn't you come to yesterday's party?
When will you leave?
"You're not very hungry, are you?"
We're not going.
"The novel has sold almost 20,000 copies."
Will you join our club?
She thanked him with all her heart.
His condition is critical.
Clean up the room.
This isn't about that.
Is your father a doctor?
It left me indifferent.
Do you eat meat?
I'm a lot heavier than you.
"You live here, don't you?"
I assume that you've proofread this already.
Did you see it?
Are you on Facebook?
He had an accident at work.
The button battery for my computer's timer died.
Don't you think that Tom is a little too young to be doing that?
When was the last time you shaved?
"I can't go, nor do I want to."
This is the neighborhood where I grew up.
It is easy to tell him from his brother.
Tom liked his old car.
You ought to have told me that before.
You can't leave yet.
I must organize my thoughts.
It's Tom's fight.
What page are you on?
Tom will be so happy.
Tom was detained by the police.
Tom hates his job.
Tom was laughing.
Why can't you accept me as I am?

"If it's a nice day tomorrow, we'll go on a picnic."
Tom listens.
Do you have any more questions?
Do you think I'm stupid?
We're very disappointed in you.
My mother hates writing letters.
What do you think of these shoes?
How many languages can you speak fluently?
I'm sorry I have no pencil to write with.
Can I sleep on the couch?
Would you check this?
They eat with a knife and fork.
The tape recorder was lying on the table.
It was not until yesterday that I noticed it.
They say that old house is haunted.
Tom spread the towel out on the sand.
He cleared his throat.
Tom isn't the kind of man who would say that kind of thing.
They supplied the soldiers with enough food and water.
She told me to open the window.
The sunglasses made him look like an undercover policeman.
I arrived on the night he left.
Tom told me that everything was ready.
Where is everybody?
I want to talk to you about something.
Get out of my kitchen.
Tom is a financial advisor.
Tom broke that one.
They kept talking all the time.
Tom is sure that he'll be able to pass the test.
You can't smoke in school.
It isn't there.
Tom corrected it.
Don't tell my wife.
I haven't made much progress.
I don't know if I should stay or run.
My mom will kill me.
Everyone screamed.
That's just your imagination.
You should've done it yourself.
I had hoped that he would recover.
Tom told everyone that he was able to speak three languages.
What do you like to eat the most?
Tom appeared busy.
Her hair was long enough to reach the floor.
He dressed like a girl.
There's nobody in the house. Everybody's outside.
I need some soap.
Are you sure you don't want some of this?
Please don't ever do that again.
He made me his assistant.
Stop yelling at me.
Ancient customs are dying out quickly today.
Tom spoke loud enough for everyone to hear.
He talks as though he knew everything.
I doubt whether he is honest.
Do you have a smartphone?
A truck ran over our dog.
It's something Tom made.
He has a loud voice.
This is a good book for children to read.
I look forward to it.
Tom and Mary exchanged numbers at the party.
He doesn't know how to write a letter in English.
How come you don't do that?
Tom apologized to the families of the victims for the explosion at the factory.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
"Tom is my age, or maybe a little younger."
He speaks English as if he were an American.
Tom looked scared.
"After months of looking, Mary purchased a new dress."
I was the one who dug this hole.
Push this button and the door will open.
This is the office in which he works.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
What was Tom's reaction?
Let's not let things get us down.
I'm afraid the doctor is out.
You look as healthy as ever.
The campaign succeeded and he won the election.
You'd have fun.
Can I have half a kilo apples?
It must be Tom.
I caught up with him soon.
Tom and Mary are both very happy.
A group of teenagers robbed me of my money.
I just don't get it.
What'll you do this weekend?
Why don't you sit next to Tom?
Many American planes were shot down.
This made me very sad.
Why do so many people visit Kyoto?
I haven't downloaded the files yet.
We're at home.
Have you lost your ticket?
Is there any truth to that rumor?
You aren't thinking.
I don't like him coming to my house so often.
"I have looked everywhere, but I can not find my wallet."
What does Tom like to do that you don't like to do?
I'm on the way home.
Let me introduce my sister to you.
Tom often comes to see me on weekends.
Have you tried it before?
What does PTA stand for?
The old book was moldy.
Her mother must have smelled something fishy.
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today.
My grandmother went peacefully in the night.
She opens the window.
"If you studied hard, you would get good marks."
Everyone voted for it. No one voted against it.
It was not until five years later that I heard of his marriage.
I can only stay a few minutes.
The theater was jam-packed.
They've never met.
"I know you're here, Tom."
What does Tom think of Mary?
Don't expect any miracles.
Tom left his parents' house this spring and has been living alone since then.
Comfort Tom.
"I'm really tired, so I'm going to go to bed early tonight."
Go ahead and tell him if you want to.
You'll regret having said those words.
I would not be the same without you.
Tom can't picture himself as a teacher.
May I talk to you?
I'm very sorry about Tom.
My cat loves toys.
Tom and Mary don't know what to do.
Wait until I tell Tom about this.
Help yourself.
I'm sure Tom won't help us.
The cat caught the rats.
Do you know how to cook fish?
I believe I have now told you everything.
Tom turned when he heard Mary shout.
Tom shuffled the cards.
The lack of money is the root of all evil.
Put this medicine where children can't get it.
I'm skimming his report right now.
Don't let such a good opportunity go by.
Why do we have to do this?
Both my father and I went to the museum for the first time.
This book is not available in Japan.
I could tell by the look on his face that he had come on very important business.
You should look into it.
Tom gives us money.
How could you do that?
I didn't want to disappoint Tom.
I must convince Tom.
Tom spent most days begging for money in front of tourist attractions.
Tom kept dropping subtle hints about what he wanted for his birthday.
He sometimes goes to Tokyo on business.
Tom is being blamed for it.
"Unfortunately, an error has occurred."
I never knew Tom could speak French.
Do you know how Tom got that scar on his chin?
Are you back home now?
I had no idea you were here.
The man was sitting on a fallen tree.
I ran out of the house.
Tom caught a thief.
There were three men in the room.
I play trumpet in a symphonic wind orchestra.
"I'm not rich, but not poor either."
I think Tom's homemade cookies are better than the ones Mary makes.
I am prettier than you.
Tom is pretty good at chess.
Tom said you might be interested in this book.
Tom opened the curtains.
You must be joking!
You know very well how it happened.
I requested extra salt on my French fries.
We don't have much choice.
He's buying an old hat.
"Thanks for this, Tom."
"Who will be the next class president, Tom or Mary?"
Are you sure that this isn't true?
That could take a few months.
Can I be excused?
I could not catch as many fish as I had expected.
Tom pointed at one of the names on the list.
Don't ever give up hope.
Tom didn't let Mary kiss him.
"It's not exactly a hot spot, it's more of a dive bar."
I often play volleyball.
Tom looks OK.
She has completely recovered from her illness.
Some children do not like vegetables.
Has Tom ever asked you to loan him money?
This is the boy I met there yesterday.
Tom opened the window to get some fresh air.
Tom usually goes to school by bicycle.
Did you reserve a room at the hotel?
Tom is not as good a chess player as he thinks he is.
You're not a very nice person.
It's like magic.
Tom is married and has three children.
Tom has already eaten.
Tom can't see anything without his glasses.
My aunt made me a new skirt.
I found nothing interesting in that magazine.
I'm really glad I came here.
"Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead."
I don't know anything about his past.
The dress Mary was wearing was white.
We have a lot more food than we need.
You've lied to me before. Why should I trust you now?
You'd better go to see your family doctor at once.
They had a boat.
Tom and Mary are about the same height.
Tom is eager to buy a new car.
Always obey your father.
This explains everything.
"Stop, or I'll shoot."
Don't underestimate my power.
Do you have any money left?
Tom doesn't want to admit that he has a drinking problem.
Reflect on what you have done.
"Unless you listen carefully, you'll be in trouble later."
I was badly in need of his help at that time.
I didn't say anything to hurt his feelings.
We meet once a month.
Watch out for Tom.
I had my wallet stolen.
They weren't impressed.
The man ran away.
I'll be seventeen next year.
Do you guys think I'm fat?
Something is wrong with my typewriter.
You're surrounded.
Tom was up until about 3:00 a.m. reading a book.
He was never to see his wife and family again.
That's what my friends keep telling me.
I'm really looking forward to Tom's visit.
Medication and alcohol often don't mix.
I liked your story.
I think Tom will like that.
They don't talk to me anymore.
"I gave one to Tom, too."
I'm a total wreck.
Tom was obstinate.
I received your letter.
He has three older sisters.
How much is the ticket?
Hundreds of people work in this factory.
Aluminum is a metal.
Tom is lying about that.
I think Tom is jealous.
We're not going anywhere.
"We miss you, too."
Let's go now.
We don't make anything anymore.
What're you looking at?
They parted with a firm handshake.
Isn't it cool?
I'm going away for a month.
This matter does not concern me.
You've got to stay awake.
Do your children drink milk?
Some people say they can predict the future.
Try these on.
We listened carefully in order not to miss a single word.
May I leave this book with you?
He baked muffins.
Have you made your decision yet?
Save yourself.
You are absolutely right.
He didn't see anything.
"English is just one of over 2,700 languages in the world today."
She shot him.
The front door was open.
We stored the hay in the barn.
I want you to love me.
Do you like being famous?
Take an umbrella with you.
Do you have a headache and a sore throat?
Sorry I'm late. I overslept.
I have a truck.
"May I have a cup of tea, please?"
I want him to leave.
Who'd believe you anyway?
We're going to try to find a way to do that.
I think about him all the time.
Get away from here.
Who makes the decisions here?
Tom could have dealt with the problem in a better way.
Where are we eating tonight?
I have never seen anyone like him.
I don't care if you believe me.
Tom is extra careful.
It doesn't matter.

I would like a piece of cheese.

"You stole the money, didn't you?"
I don't know you.
I meant to call you.
Tom didn't believe me.
How are they doing it?
Stay absolutely still.
What a pity you can't dance!
I thought you were a nurse.
I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
Would you mind if I drive?

I'm much heavier than you.
You could do that.
Tom is under the bed.
Did anyone see you come in?
She prepared the meal in a very short time.
I'd love to meet him.
Tom is in pretty good shape for his age.
I saw the way you were looking at each other.
Where was the princess?
Please sit down!
I don't read newspapers much.
My father is a teacher.
It's still raining.

Don't ask them where they are going.
We have no other option.
I don't like people like Tom.
Do you recognize this T-shirt?
Tom can't go home until after 2:30.
Was she seen?
I've never told anybody this before.
I've never seen anything like it.
Have you solved all the problems yet?
You should have helped him with his work.
I got her to wash dishes.
We reached the top of the mountain.
I didn't let them know.
No one believes me.
"I heard that, but I didn't know it was true."
What'll Tom do with that?
Tom runs a charity.
I got it.
Tom is shirtless.
We don't have a whole lot of time.

I hope we meet again someday soon.
You don't give orders here.
My brother has a gift for painting.
Do you know why she's jealous of me?

Please make way for him.
I have a friend who cuts his own hair.
The road continues for many miles.
Why does that interest you?
They seem busy.
My watch is five minutes fast.
"Envious people die, but envy never does."
What can I get you?
Keep singing.
I just have one question for you.
I can't identify it.
I have to see Tom at 2:30.

How are you going to convince Tom?
Tom turned and walked to the exit.

I know what you look like.
Tom had both of his socks on inside out.

What time's your shift?
I wish you would shut the door when you go out.
They trust each other.
I will stay.
I'm glad to see you enjoy your work so much.
We're out of stock now.
I haven't seen Tom in a month.

Tom has known Mary for a long time.
We are sure of his honesty.

They're my cousins.
Tom saw a crack in the wall.
Tom betrayed Mary's trust.
What does it mean?
A year has twelve months.
What do you want me to do about it?
Mary placed her baby in a car seat for the flight.
Tom loves telling the story about how he and Mary met.
It would be stupid to say no.
There's no turning back.
No one knows the answer.
Many Americans supported Nixon.
Someone took my place.
How's your day going?
I want you to get off my back.
Let's go to the flea market tomorrow.
She will be able to answer your question.
I caught him stealing the camera.
He came here ten minutes ago.

I think it's time for me to close the window.
He likes fishing.
Do you think Tom knows what's going on?

Tom is out of his mind.
Some of the luggage hasn't arrived yet.
That's a tower.
I don't want to know his name.
You are confusing me.
It was a terrible day.
Naples is a picturesque city.
Do you enjoy losing?

Come downstairs.
I'm just about to head off to the station.
When was the last time you saw her?
I read an exciting story.
We've got something for you.
Tom is a man of few words.
Tom was completely devastated when he heard that Mary had been killed.
It's not always so easy to do the right thing.
How many times do you have to go to the dentist?
Tom lost 30 kilograms.
City life suits me very well.
You'll feel better after you eat something.
"In some ways, Boston is nicer than Chicago."
"Do you think he'll come? ""I hope not."""
I only work part-time.
Don't play dead.
Does Tom have any brothers?
Tom deserved it.
She's three years older than I am.
"Unfortunately, there was no one around."
Drive faster.
The barking dog kept Tom awake most of the night.
This is your only chance.
Tom was just trying to do the right thing.
Tom didn't even look at Mary.
Tom may do whatever he wants.
Tom had ambition.
Are you really a doctor?
I don't know which one to choose.
Did you see what Tom did to Mary?
Maybe your name really is Tom.
How did this misunderstanding ever arise?
The grass is always greener on the other side.
How may I help you?
Would you like to visit the White House someday?
He was delicate as a child.
Tom sat there in silence.
I will listen.
Tom stole something from my house.
How much applesauce did you eat?
I think Tom might've said something he shouldn't have.
She fell in love with the new teacher.
I ate a banana.
Keep mum about this plan.
"Are your parents home? ""Only my dad."""
This is how I feel.
I can't believe Tom made a mistake like that.
I don't need advisers.
I need more time.
Tom and I were both right.
Tom doesn't know where Mary went.
We were greatly relieved to find that the worst dangers were over.
Did you enjoy your winter holidays?
Why are you picking on me?
Computers are better than us at playing chess.
We're all right.
What does this remind you of?
Tom looked cold.
"I enjoyed it, too."
They vanished.
Organ donations save lives.
Tom might want to go there with us.
Tom is the Jacksons' gardener.
I think I'll come back soon.
Don't get caught.
They loved it.
How did such a strange thing come about?
It was just stupid.
It is soft to the touch.
That girl is more cute than beautiful.
"Tom seldom, if ever, complains about anything."
I enjoyed your company.
Your names were crossed off the list.
His house is within a stone's throw of his school.
She became more and more beautiful as she grew older.
I saw him coming upstairs.
Do you want to know the truth?
I play the violin.
That's not what he said.
I have nothing to do with this accident.
I'd do the same for you.
Who volunteered?
Tom and Mary both like to cook.
Tom bought a camera to give to Mary.
"As is often the case with her, she didn't show up on time."
How did you enjoy the party?
What are the animals that you can see in this picture?
When did you find out?
We must keep a diary every day.
There was a terrible accident on the freeway.
I can't keep lying to Tom.
You know what Tom wants.
Tom spends a lot of time with Mary.
Why is life so difficult?
It's high time you stopped wasting your money.
She left home with everything she owned.
Don't act like you're so innocent.
He knows lots.
Tom doesn't seem like himself.
Sorry to be late.
I thought you had already eaten.
I like this song better than the last one you wrote.
Let's stop and take a rest.
I'm standing.
"When you leave, I'll miss you."
We have no alternatives.
Please turn around and look at me.
No one voted against it.
He didn't jump high enough to win a prize.
She had to part with her fur coat.
It could happen to anybody.
Leave Tom.
Who buys this type of art?
My husband is a good man.
You have to turn in the reports on Monday.
My heart aches for those starving children.
I miss talking with you.
Tell me what you want me to do.
I can't understand what happened.
The cat is lazy.
I read comic books.
Tom says he wasn't here yesterday. It must've been someone else you saw.
The moon is brighter than usual tonight.
I've come all the way from Boston.
I've used up all the toothpaste.
Don't say anything that you might regret later.
"Tom wants something, but I'm not sure what."
It is none the less true.
Let me congratulate you on your marriage.
Her mother made her a new dress.
You're going to have to do better than that.
Be discreet.
How many times have you done that before?
Two against one is not a fair fight.
I'm a good teacher.
Does Tom eat fish?
No one was more surprised than me.
May I take a few days off to visit my family?
Do you mind if I open the door?
You've upset Tom.
I'll bring it back.
Are you aware that Okinawa is closer to China than to Honshu?
Could you bring me something to eat?
You need a joystick.
Tell me everything Tom said to you.
I just flew back from Boston.
She heard him cry.
I tried to avoid looking at her eyes.
What does Tom really want?
Do you have one a little bigger than these?
Did Tom say what happened exactly?
I can't help it.
Most opponents of slavery did not vote.
I don't like to go outside when it's raining.
Do you need much money?
We're about three blocks from the train station.
The alarm didn't wake Tom.
Why did you lend money to someone like him?
This is a captivating story.
"Tom couldn't do that, could he?"
It's a once in a lifetime experience.
He is sure of success.
"In a way, you are right."
Will that ever change?
When do you usually go to bed?
I believe you can help us.
I saw her yesterday.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
He can move quietly and quickly.
I have what you want.
Take me to your leader.
You didn't have to do this.
I can't believe that a guy like Tom was married to a woman as beautiful as Mary.
I must remember to see her.
A bat is no more a bird than a rat is.
Do you work here?
Tom kept fighting.
Tom sat nearby.
Tom wrote his name on the cover of his new diary.
Why don't we go dancing?
My plan is to spend the New Year's holiday in Australia.
You can't keep me here.
Didn't you like breakfast today?
I have many books that I haven't read.
Nearly a thousand people participated in the demonstration.
Tom often cuts classes.
Are Tom and Mary in Boston?
She pretended to be a student.
Would you like to have some tea?
I hope nobody followed you.
You barely touched your food.
What time is it now?
Tom supported the proposal wholeheartedly.
I wonder why we haven't run into each other before.
Tom played Moonlight Sonata at his high school recital.
Have you guys seen Tom?
Have you ever seen a puppet show?
Tom called a cab for me.
Tom said you wouldn't come.
Ask Tom what he's done.
"At the Battle of Verdun, French forces stopped a German attack."
It's because of you that we were able to complete this job on time.
She opened the door.
The policeman took the thief by the arm.
He had an accident.
I feel like an amoeba.
We're not ready to order yet.
I should've paid a little more attention.
I am well.
Why did you move out?
This new bus service will meet the residents' needs.
I have the same number of books as he has.
He had few teeth.
All the exams are now behind us.
I just want a little more coffee.
"Tom, what would you like to have for dinner?"
The premier is likely to resign.
Everything else doesn't matter now.
Where do you see yourself in five years?
Is there anything new?
Tom's way of talking gets on my nerves.
It makes me happy to hear that.
Why isn't it good?
The thief ran quickly.
Tom saw Mary driving her new car.
A bad workman always blames his tools.
I have a friend who went to school with Tom.
She was in such a hurry that she left her umbrella behind on the train.
You're out of touch with reality.
I'm not worried and neither should you be.
I'm going to have breakfast with Tom tomorrow.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
Tom's not in his car.
He can read and write.
Tom is the oldest player on our team.
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.
Some kind of party upstairs kept me up till one last night.
The victim's body was lying face down on the rug.
You are a troublemaker.
You had no reason to do that.
Perhaps we could talk later.
The telephone rang several times.
Tom was ruthless.
I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.
You ought to write a book.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
The ice cream is melting.
Tom wants to discuss the problem with Mary.
Her old cat is still alive.
Boston is a wonderful city.
How many pies did you bake?
Your work is below average.
Do you sell fruit?
We're undressing.
I looked in the window.
Has anyone found Tom yet?
I wonder what Tom's favorite color is.
I'm surprised no one else heard the gunshots.
The bottom 40% of the U.S. population has only 0.3% of the wealth.
She was moved to tears.
"Eight years ago, we were in the early stages of what would become the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes."
We'll check on it right now.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow.
Tom is trying to do just that.
Don't let Tom near my kids.
What are you saving up for?
Tom and Mary wrote many of their songs together.
Let me do my job.
Tom works from early in the morning until late at night every day.
I hid in the woods all day.
There's something she's not telling us.
It is in April that our school years start.
Am I boring you?
You're reliable.
Tom was with the FBI at the time.
Did you live here?
I am disgusted with him.
I can't do this all by myself.
Tom said you were busy.
I don't want to see Tom.
Can I book two seats on that flight?
He is a good doctor.
I couldn't help overhearing your conversation with Tom.
You can put your name on a name tag.
Mary isn't really sick. She's just pretending to be sick.
Some members were not present.
Tom can't remember his kindergarten teacher's name.
Tom said he'd be right back.
Tom sleeps with his window open.
Have you seen my pen?
That was just plain stupid.
Tom says he can't remember what he and Mary were talking about at that time.
Could you put this report into Italian for me?
Tom looked up at me.
That's what I've always loved about you.
I know about Tom.
Tom appreciated Mary's advice.
Tom sat cross-legged on the couch.
I hope you don't mind walking.
He's had a fever for the past few days.
I want you to meet my cousin.
There is a black BMW parked in front of your house.
Tom looks perky.
The two companies are competing with each other.
Commodity prices were rising.
Tom looks stuck.
She picked me an apple.
Is that singer popular among your friends?
I'll sleep on the couch.
I'll stay here until you return.
He did it the old fashioned way.
Tom will never tell you what really happened.
There's hardly any coffee left in the pot.
I like to play tennis.
It's a matter of etiquette.
This diamond ring is too extravagant for me.
I'm sorry for ruining your birthday party.
I sat down and opened my laptop.
I've got to get back to the meeting.
Tom liked Mary's new hairstyle.
"Without your advice, I would have been robbed of my bag."
They love this song.
I'm making scrambled eggs.
Tom sat cross-legged on the floor.
Which city are you going to visit first?
We'll watch you.
"I don't know what we're going to find, but we should find something."
He is a jealous man.
Tom deleted Mary's email message.
I want you here tomorrow by 2:30.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Are you sure you don't want to wait till tomorrow?
The bar where Tom works lost its license because they had been selling alcoholic drinks to minors.
Tom failed the test.
I can't go any further.
She's gone on a trip.
Please open the door for me.
That's a great picture.
She always gets up early.
They lived together for two years before they got married.
He's still at work.
Tom and I looked at each other in amazement.
Do you really want me to give your computer to Tom?
I must've sat on it.
She is talking.
Tom is mean.
"When I got out of prison, my ex-wife and I got remarried."
Of course!
I'm surprised that you won the prize.
Don't forget to close the door.
Tom broke both of his legs.
This desk is good.
I bought some bread on the way home from work.
You have no right to tell me what to do.
I think that helped me.
It's just so exciting.
Did you check this?
You've done so much for me.
There's no right or wrong way to grieve.
My uncle drives a Ford.
I shaved.
Do you still love him?
I want to have this letter registered.
The method Tom suggested might work.
You look familiar.
Tom likes carrots.
This area is off-limits.
You were absent from school yesterday.
Did you love Tom?
This apartment is within biking distance of the university.
He sat surrounded by his family.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
"When I was in school, left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hands."
I like languages.
I support the proposal.
I saw you.
Tom will never see you again.
I want to be here with you.
Tom can't remember Mary's address.
Everybody but Tom knows why his wife left him.
How long did you stay there?
Tom cut down a cherry tree.
Be cool.
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston.
He paused to have a cigarette.
Tom was amused.
You have to accept the inevitable.
I meet him at the club from time to time.
He's walking around in his underwear.
I know the police suspect me.
Why don't you give Tom a chance?
He was wearing a dinner jacket.
Would you like to go?
They say that she was born in Germany.
How about having a barbecue party next Sunday?
These goods are in great demand.
Barbecuing is one way to cook meat.
How do I get my dog to eat dog food?
I've saved you a seat next to me.
You're not welcome here.
"From here on out, it's smooth sailing."
A terrible thing has happened.
You alone can help me.
She tore the letter up after reading it.
Tom is something of a musician.
The pond is too shallow for swimming.
Sydney is far from here.
We knew this.
She stood by him.
I know what Tom did to you.
I'd completely forgotten that Tom used to be a vegetarian.
Tom isn't particularly bothered about what other people think of him.
Did you invite him?
We should be fine.
Tom wondered how many times he'd have to tell Mary to clean her room before she finally did it.
Go and speak to my colleague.
I'm not too certain about it myself.
I won't be able to pay for it.
Tom said his job was a lot of fun.
It's really hot in here.
The method Tom suggested might've been better.
Tom had a hard time finding work.
I'm not worried about him.
All I can do at the moment is wait.
I am pleased with the result.
It always makes me feel a bit uneasy.
I hate Mondays.
"That's what I love about you, Tom."
Tom and Mary split the bill.
I happened to be in Boston at that time.
I don't like dogs.
I'll stay with you until Tom gets here.
I usually take a bath before going to bed.
How do you do that?
The agreement was a product of compromise between the two governments.
He caught a big fish.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
I don't even know what Tom's real name is.
Tom ignored my advice.
Tom took piano lessons for several years.
Why do you have to do that?
I guess that she is over thirty.
He picked up a red stone.
Mary is folding the laundry.
Tom said you speak French.
I'm not as stubborn as Tom is.
You have nothing to worry about.
He is his own master.
What would you do if you were in Tom's place?
My jacket's in the car.
Wouldn't you rather sit by the window?
You're looking good!
There were about one thousand people.
She picked him up at the station.
Don't talk about it anymore.
Does it hurt when you breathe?
Tom is oblivious.
Don't you believe me?
"Tom, there's a call for you."
She waited patiently for him.
I was just in time for the flight.
Do you like the colors?
We took a back road to avoid the heavy traffic.
Have you bought your ticket already?
Where did Tom learn that?
You missed.
"You won't be busy this afternoon, will you?"
He never gave way to temptation.
All I found is a pair of scissors.
The couple decided to adopt an orphan.
I don't know what you want to hear.
Tom thinks it'll be fine.
You have to fight.
Is your mother a good cook?
I'll see you in October.
All of my brothers have jobs.
Tom may do that for you.
I admit to being careless.
Tom is now staying in Boston.
Time goes by quickly when you're having fun.
It was his wish to go to Paris.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
To master English is hard.
It won't matter in the long run.
I'm going to go shopping after lunch.
Tom kept the secret to himself.
Remove your coat and empty your pockets.
"I am going to my room, where I can study."
You must be joking!
He doesn't need to get up so early.
We're going to have a lot of fun. I'm sure of it.
Don't be noisy in this room.
May I escort you home?
Don't be a cheapskate.
I admit that I was a little drunk.
I'll do what I have to.
Mary fluctuates between having an exaggerated sense of her own importance and an inferiority complex.
Don't touch my stuff.
It was a waste of time and effort.
I thought you'd changed.
Tom likes beans.
Tom nervously entered.
Tom married Mary.
What are you watching?
Please don't look at your mobile phone while we're eating.
Let's go somewhere private.
He can imitate the rest of the family.
Dr. Bell treated the patient.
Tom read the book Mary gave him.
Can we talk about what happened that day?
I'm not really worried about it.
Spain is the host country for the Olympics in 1992.
What's your decision?
Are those people terrorists?
I promised Tom I wouldn't say anything.
Tom received a commendation for bravery for rescuing a woman from a burning house.
Not all of the books are instructive.
You didn't need to take a taxi.
Willingness to correct is an indication of wisdom.
This is so dumb.
This kid is wearing shorts.
Don't you believe me?
"Don't speak so fast, please."
I live in Australia.
Tom has a sore back.
I walked to the door and opened it.
You'd better have a good explanation for this.
Where will you be on October 20th?
"I heard you last night, Tom."
She's only interested in fish and cockroaches.
She talked as if she were my mother.
Improved medical technology has been one of the spin-offs of the space program.
Primitive calculating machines existed long before computers were developed.
I had him repair my watch.
Do you know her father?
I don't have the money to do that.
The cathedral's clock just struck three.
I don't understand what you're saying.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom had a daughter?
I hate reptiles.
He shouts a lot.
Do you go to school on Saturday?
Tom and Mary are both students.
She died from TB.
Today's friends are tomorrow's enemies.
Tom knew that Mary was rich.
The snow prevented the airplane from taking off.
How long did you stay there?
Tom killed Mary because he found out she had started the fire that had killed his family.
How do you like your new class?
I got some shampoo in my eyes and it stings.
What do you know about that?
I had a suspicion that he would leave me.
I am reading a play.
Tom is good at handball.
What are you doing to me?
Tom just went inside.
Here's my number.
Tom is sweet.
We haven't come to a decision yet.
Australia exports a lot of wool.
I'm going to rest before I go out.
It's hard to keep up with you.
Tom was lucky.
Please let me in.
Tom wants to get to know you.
Are you going to sing here?
He thinks I'm jealous.
There are more clouds today than yesterday.
I knew it was a joke.
I want you to come with me to see Tom.
Tom opened a beer.
My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy.
Tom went to prison for selling drugs.
I understand French a little.
I was chained to the desk all day.
I think you should ask for your money back.
You are to do your homework before supper.
We will have a music contest soon.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Tom paused.
An antique pot was dug out.
He missed his flight.
You're not going to believe this.
The group is still performing. Why are you leaving?
I'm waiting for the right man.
Do you have a match?
"In this book, the writer contrasts Japan with America."
Tom doesn't sing so much anymore.
Tom wasn't home.
"He told me he was a liar, but I don't believe him."
The difference in their ages is six years.
My sister is a moron.
Is there a fee?
I am convinced that my son is innocent.
Will you please wipe the dust off the table?
Green suits you.
This is where Tom wants to live.
I'm sorry about the other day.
It's got to be now.
There is no wind today.
You of all people should know the dangers.
I wonder if that's even possible.
Let's have a go at it.
Eating habits differ from country to country.
We're always hungry.
Oceans do not so much divide the world as unite it.
There is a dragonfly on the ceiling.
Tom thinks he knows the answer.
Everything happened very quickly and it was all very strange.
I'll get the others.
"Tom is rich, successful and handsome."
This paper does not absorb ink.
What do you want to give Tom?
I sometimes hear my father singing in the shower.
Turn it up.
We drank all night.
I'm a prisoner.
He has a few pens.
"Will you have another slice of pie? ""Yes, please."""
We paid a heavy price for this victory.
Each of them was given a prize.
My girlfriend is very jealous.
My advice is to not tell Tom.
I don't get what you mean.
It's still crowded.
"I've got an exam in a few minutes, and I'm going to fail for sure."
Tom is going to love doing that.
Tom looked a bit sick.
I need a doctor.
Don't leave the engine running.
She kissed her father on the cheek.
All our attempts failed.
"She asked him to call her later, but he forgot to."
Check your car before you drive to make sure that your lights are working.
Do you think that's fair?
Have a beer with me.
They've fooled you.
Tom and Mary seem so happy together.
I wish you hadn't done that.
We tried to do something about it.
I wish I'd bought a white dress!
You don't have to hide your feelings.
This bus will take you to the airport.
Get me up at eight.
Why would I care where Tom is?
The baby stopped crying.
Tom has returned.
It was gambling that brought about his ruin.
I want to be treated with respect.
My son still believes in Santa Claus.
The plane took off exactly at six.
Did you hear what I said to Tom?
They are going to exhibit many famous old paintings at the gallery.
The house where Tom lives is in the old part of the city.
The boy standing over there is my son.
Can anyone hear me?
Tom looks dazed.
I don't seem to be having much luck today.
You have to give me more time.
I don't like the smell of the perfume Mary is wearing today.
I'm accustomed to sitting up late.
Tom had no time to waste.
My father and I go fishing once in a while.
This book is too expensive.
He extorted a large amount of money from her.
Tom will find out sooner or later.
That's important.
I helped her hang the picture on the wall.
The concert wasn't very good.
There's no need to worry.
She is quick at everything.
She kept me waiting for a long time.
The defendant's innocence could not be verified.
Are you from here?
We want to know.
Who's going to stop me?
What does it taste like?
You cannot do this.
Are you the new teacher?
I am taking a rest in my car.
What's your sister's name?
Tom does this for a living.
Tom blocked Mary's punch and kicked her again.
She smiled at him.
They're having a break at the moment.
I said I'll be fine.
Tom recovered.
I like you just the way you are.
Tom didn't think what Mary was wearing was appropriate for the occasion.
The muddy road has ruined my new shoes.
"Fill out this registration card, please."
I have been associated with him for ten years.
We went up the mountain by cable car.
Why's Tom staying in Boston?
It may rain.
The kitchen of this house is very large.
Please don't say anything embarrassing.
"This man is very, very old."
I'll call you in the evening.
How did Tom convince Mary to marry him?
Tom can't remember exactly where he parked his car.
That man said his name was Tom.
Have you read this book yet?
Tom is moving back in with us.
He carried on with his experiment.
She is a famous singer.
Make sure you go to a doctor if you get worse.
That's a new record.
Tom is arrogant.
Did Tom go to Boston?
I'd like to play tennis with you.
I'd like to rent a car.
Paper is a Chinese invention.
"If anyone can fix this, it's Tom."
You may take either of the books.
I like red wine better than white wine.
Tom helped Mary to her feet.
Do you know if he's coming to the party?
Tom and Mary's friends helped them move into their new apartment.
"Tom started as a janitor, but he's now the president of the company."
I don't think that I'm the only one who noticed.
I'll give it back next Monday without fail.
Tom starved to death.
Let me know what time you plan to be here.
Will you join us?
I saw the figure of a man.
I'm looking for a job.
I can't take my eyes off her.
Tom coughed.
"You're from Boston, aren't you?"
There are no classes in August.
My friend is really a clown.
Someone left their umbrella in the hall.
Please go.
Tom had his house painted white.
Jesus was a carpenter.
No one is watching us.
They each paid separately.
Where've you been?
I remember what you said the other day.
Your dreams have come true.
He stuck out his tongue at his teacher.
You should get to the airport early.
What will you use it for?
She took a deep breath.
What happened to the rest of the food?
My hair is wet.
He fell ill a few days ago.
Tom said he thinks that you're stupid.
Why are we going to Australia?
"A bad habit, once formed, is difficult to get rid of."
Cocoa can be very bitter.
I can't do it without you.
Where else in Boston do you want to go?
You're forgetting Tom.
I didn't know that Tom didn't know how to swim.
I just don't believe it.
My mother gets up early.
Are you certain you've made the right decision?
What do I owe you?
What's wrong with him?
Proverbs are still very popular in America.
Tom has trouble admitting that he's wrong.
Tom put the key in the lock and paused a moment before he turned it.
I ate with my baby brother.
Tom bought a weekly magazine at the station.
Tom was in the classroom when I left.
This doll is a gift from my aunt.
Please answer the phone.
"She likes animals, you know?"
She removed her hat when she entered the room.
The house is heated by solar energy.
Did you go to Hawaii or Guam?
Why didn't you mention this before?
I am learning Chinese.
That's not the way it happened at all.
Will she be able to leave the hospital next week?
I wish I hadn't done that.
I watched a documentary about sushi.
I don't know if I have the time.
I watched baseball on TV after I finished my homework.
We tend to forget this fact.
Tom won't be doing that anymore.
"Father has lost his job, and what's worse, Mother has fallen ill."
The villagers went in search of the missing child.
Let's pretend we didn't hear that.
He would often go fishing on Sunday.
You should treat people with more respect.
I heard you got married.
About how many books do you have?
I don't know what's wrong with Tom.
The river flows too fast to swim in.
"Go to work, Tom."
Tom made a healthy salad.
He wrote three books in three years.
I know you don't remember me.
I don't like big cities.
It's a bad habit.
He went to the hardware store to get a shovel.
I don't like studying in this heat.
I met my friend on the street.
I thought you'd never call.
Tom likes you very much.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom is unfit for that job.
"From the moment Mary became the boss, she made herself very unpopular with her subordinates."
That'll make me happy.
It's our duty to help.
Elephants are the largest land animals alive today.
I have a daughter.
I hope we can make it to your party.
Why does everyone think I'm stupid?
He admitted he had taken bribes.
Tom isn't a Japanese citizen.
She has a claim on her deceased husband's estate.
Did you see the solar eclipse yesterday?
Are you good at mathematics?
"Being together all the time, my Japanese classmates got to know each other very well."
"Tom is hiding in the closet, isn't he?"
May comes after April.
I can't get anybody to tell me anything.
Tom had three of them.
Why did you even bother to come?
I cried myself to sleep every night.
Keeping a diary is a good habit.
I'd prefer red wine.
Studies have revealed that the average keyboard has more germs than a toilet seat.
Tom knows where Mary lives.
"Even though he was sick, he went to school."
The meeting was well attended.
It's your decision.
This one is on me.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help us.
Tom went into his office and closed the door.
Would you mind if I ask you a question?
I'm not letting you escape from here.
The garbage collector comes three times a week.
Tom and Mary both make faces.
I'll take it to Tom.
Tom is somewhere in this building.
We could learn a lot from each other.
Have you read the owner's manual?
What's your favorite car?
My passport has expired.
The girl made off with her employer's money.
Continue digging.
I wasn't sure if Tom had eaten yet.
We have a serious problem.
How is it that you are always late for school?
When are you going to get married?
It looks like it's going to clear up soon.
Don't make any noise or you'll scare the birds away.
What exactly is it that you want me to say?
This is the coldest weather in ten years.
How are you getting along in your new job?
How can I know if a girl likes me?
He stayed at the hotel for two days.
It wasn't me. It was the cat.
My friend invited me to go out to dinner.
Some people consider Led Zeppelin the greatest band ever.
Tom was trying to kill Mary.
I get on well with him.
Tom said he isn't happy.
Finally she gave in to temptation and ate the whole cake.
Slavery was legal in the new Republic of Texas.
You can't always avoid problems.
We need water.
She almost drowned.
I hope Tom never gets out of prison.
Don't touch that.
Tom and his brother play on the same team.
Tom is a wealthy man.
"Can you turn on the light, please?"
Don't tempt me.
How are you?
I've told you not to call me Tom.
You don't know them.
How could you tell Tom was in pain?
"The instant the girl saw her mother, she burst out crying."
I don't mind sharing my table.
Did you kiss Tom?
I can't believe Tom made such a mistake.
I heard that one way to stay healthy is to avoid eating any food with unpronounceable ingredients.
I also like cake.
Look what you made me do.
"Tom is good at French, isn't he?"
What have you come here for?
Do you want your friend back?
Tom is a good dancer.
I'll stop by later.
Venus is a planet.
I got a bicycle for Christmas.
"I've heard that Tom can cook as well as, or better than, his wife."
Tom kicked the door open and went into the room.
The woman is reading.
That's what I want.
"In case I forget, please remind me."
She whispered something into his ear.
I have an aunt who lives in Osaka.
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow.
I like a lot of sugar in my coffee.
Tom turned on the tap.
She put her elbows on her knees.
The bottle Tom was holding had a purple label.
I'm not disappointed whatsoever.
"I wanted to ask Tom how much he paid for his new house, but Mary told me that would be impolite."
I'd also like to have a try.
I'm sorry to call you so late at night.
That's a nice brooch.
He was absent from school for a week.
Did you catch the first train?
The boy remained silent.
Tom pretended not to know how to get to Mary's school.
Do you think we'll return before dark?
I'm not afraid of the future.
Is that a trick question?
That's irrelevant.
I was woken up by the noise of the traffic outside.
He has gone to Hokkaido.
Give my regards to Tom.
You're among friends.
You can buy stamps at any post office.
Tom wondered what Mary was going to do.
This money is for a rainy day.
"I'm busy, so I can't go."
You're among friends.
He can swim well.
I've got to leave soon.
You are really very good.
I cannot stand being made fun of.
Who told you Tom broke his leg?
That will cost thirty euros.
See you.
Tom introduced himself.
Do I owe you something?
I was just going to call you.
Tom is a risk taker.
How did you get into our room?
He was forced to return to Washington.
Tom is cultured.
I'm at a loss for words.
Tom got up.
That's my job.
How long do butterflies live?
You're probably thinking we don't really need to do that.
I'll arrange for someone to pick you up at your home.
Let's walk.
It's hard to believe.
Who took care of the dog while you were away?
He was eventually sentenced to five years in prison for that violent crime.
It took only ten minutes to walk there.
"Finally, I have time to reply to the mail that I have received these past three weeks."
This is Tom's car.
Tom and Mary looked at the stars together.
How long do I have?
"His daughter, as well as his son, was famous."
I feel a great love for all of humanity.
Is this information right?
The woman hugged the baby.
You promised that you'd stand by me through thick and thin.
Would you mind not doing that?
It's clean.
He's old and crazy.
Tom seems like a really nice person.
I'm sure you're not half as glad as I am.
Isn't this what you want?
I'd like to know more about it.
I have a lot of things to do this morning.
Did you not know that?
Where are you?
The world is worried about the nuclear capabilities of Iran and North Korea.
I don't think that's a real word.
We gather here once a week.
What were you doing at Tom's house?
We have two kids.
This is the best restaurant I know of.
What have you been doing this week?
Thanks for the tip.
Call me at the office.
What kind of books do you like?
Misery loves company.
How are you today?
Is this your first trip abroad?
I just wanted to say thanks.
Why did she go to the station?
His son was expelled from school.
"Leave us alone, please."
How're you doing at home?
She refused my invitation.
Tom couldn't resist the temptation to kiss Mary.
"Tom sets the table on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Mary sets the table on the other days."
He has completely recovered and can go back to work.
Why do humans smile? This is a very difficult question to answer.
I've known Tom a lot longer than you have.
I took the book.
Are all of these books yours?
How many sisters do you have?
I think you ought to forgive us.
Tom can't describe how exciting it was.
You'd better leave.
I caught a big fish yesterday with my bare hands.
How long does it take to walk to the station?
I go every year.
Maybe someday you'll understand that.
This year the circus has ten elephants.
Who's the gorgeous girl I saw wandering around in the mall with you?
I thought you were from Boston.
Get the oranges out of the fridge.
I was just devastated.
They asked me here.
It might be Tom.
We must act at once.
Where can we meet you?
This is highly inefficient.
Now you're safe.
Tom and Mary intend to get married in the spring.
I want to keep working for Tom.
Do you want Tom punished for what he did?
Tom padded his resume.
We never get enough to eat.
She's a bad liar.
Are you hurt?
Tom isn't going to stop doing that.
She's taller than him.
That's not safe.
She sang as she walked.
Please answer the question.
Mary went about her business as if nothing had happened.
I'll let you know later.
They walked.
Tom was welcome wherever he went.
Why is my dog always scratching himself?
Tom reluctantly followed Mary.
Did you change your clothes?
I really want to be a good teacher.
Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
Take it apart if necessary.
Please wait your turn.
Are you afraid of me?
It's Saturday.
"Climate is what we expect, weather is what we get."
She writes to me once a month.
Why are you sleeping?
What do you think of my theory?
Tom is a grown man.
Mary made a reservation at a Japanese restaurant for Valentine's day.
Tom didn't keep Mary waiting too long.
I don't like scary movies.
I thought what Tom did was cute.
Go away.
I found out where Tom lives.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.
I should go now.
Keep doing what you're doing.
They should lock him up and throw away the key.
Why don't you answer your dad?
Why are you stopping?
No one succeeds in the world without effort.
Tom couldn't stop talking about Mary.
The trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
He discovered that he had made a mistake.
Tom didn't agree.
Tom will go as well.
Tom likes to eat cold pizza for breakfast.
That's not what Tom is talking about.
Clark Kent is the hero of the Superman stories.
"My uncle, who lives in Paris, came to see us."
This new medicine may aid your recovery.
I can't swim.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Our food supplies will last till April.
What is it that you want me to do now?
I thought it was a good idea at the time.
I suddenly felt really strange.
It's a bit further way.
Brush your teeth after eating.
I can do magic tricks.
Tom is a good friend of mine.
Pick me up at 2:30.
A man is as old as he feels and a woman as old as she looks.
We're armed.
He is the richest man in town.
I've been put in charge of this project.
He wouldn't dare show his face around here again.
It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
What're you so happy about?
How much money did you spend in total?
I had a little fever this morning.
I'll never help you.
Do you know why Tom is absent from school?
They say that he was very poor when he was young.
The number of working women is increasing.
I asked Tom where he had bought his car.
"All at once, I heard a shrill cry."
Go home.
I don't like dogs.
He read the document aloud.
It doesn't matter what we do.
I don't know where I'm going.
Does anyone know where Tom is?
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
"As is often the case with him, he was late again."
Tom read about Mary's accident in the newspaper.
It could be a hoax.
I expected to see Tom yesterday.
Tom is now in jail.
Where's my shirt?
Would you like me to explain it to you?
Do you have a tattoo?
"The more she talked, the more bored I got."
"Everyone, including Tom, was sitting around the table."
Tom has a good chance of getting elected.
I painted a picture for you.
Tom saw John and Mary holding hands.
I can't imagine what Tom might be thinking about.
You look surprised.
I'm a married woman now.
Tom interviewed Mary.
I'm going to miss being here.
Did Tom mind?
Tom isn't mad at you.
Have a safe trip.
The children were sitting on the floor in front of Tom.
Explain that to me.
Would you like to sit?
We should keep up friendly relations with neighboring countries.
Tom gave Mary flowers.
You're a fantastic kisser.
Who else was at Tom's party?
I won't deny that.
I always wondered what that noise was.
Can I go with you?
Cut it in half.
May I ask why it is that you don't want to talk about it?
You look like a tourist.
I don't want Tom's help.
The construction of a highway will contribute to the growth of the suburbs.
Tom closed his speech with a beautiful song.
Do you think that I'm not trying my best?
What is considered impolite in one language may not be considered impolite in another language.
That can't be Mary. She's in the hospital now.
Have you eaten dinner?
Do you really want to risk that?
What's going on up there?
I'd be very grateful if you'd help me.
What time is it by your watch?
Tom is the only witness to the crime.
How lucky we are!
I can't see any difference.
He was imprisoned.
How many times am I supposed to give you the benefit of the doubt?
She returned safe and sound.
Tom is in no hurry to sell his car.
This room is very warm.
The old man is hard to please.
Tom found Mary's diary and read the last three pages.
Tom picked up the coins that had fallen behind the sofa.
Is there anything else I need to know?
She has been studying English since the age of ten.
This is too long.
I thought you'd changed.
This statue was erected ten years ago.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
Do you know the man standing on the bridge?
Rice grows in warm climates.
The floor feels cold.
Come on. Give it a try.
You're not expected to do anything we wouldn't do ourselves.
"You're going to have to do it yourself, aren't you?"
Stop being so emotional.
Don't stand up.
You should both just relax.
I'm certain he's coming.
Would you please leave?
I hardly ever remember dreams.
Stop complaining.
He may have misunderstood you.
Yesterday was the last day of school.
My sister is also my best friend.
I won't let you escape.
Is French harder than English?
I was told to contact you.
I think it was a misunderstanding.
Tom left step-by-step instructions for the person who would be filling in for him while he was on leave.
"In Singapore, it is a crime to spit on the ground."
This is the most interesting book I've ever read.
It is regarded as a grey area.
The policeman is now on duty.
Tom put some branches into the wood chipper.
I just don't feel like it.
I want you to go there.
Can you touch the bottom?
"Thanks to them, I got well at last."
Tom made us do the work.
Tom is old enough to be Mary's grandfather.
He is his usual self.
The mail is delivered once a day.
I'm pretty sure Tom is dating Mary.
She went to a movie the other day.
There's a lot of competition in business.
Roll down your window.
It's been a long night.
Let's go to the beach.
Do you always help Tom with his homework?
Tom saved your life.
When would you like me to come over?
He wants to be a policeman in the future.
A sponge absorbs water.
"In both appearance and personality, Tom is exactly like his father."
You can't kill us all.
Tom was worried.
Tom and Mary live near the library.
Tom won't come.
Have you ever tried to swim across this river?
Tom wants to go with us.
You'd better go back home now.
Divide this among yourselves.
I have one with me.
Tom was away at camp all summer.
Don't use computer translation.
We waited for you all day long.
I can't pay my rent today.
I purchased one bag.
Tom never wears red.
You've got a bright future ahead of you.
Tom said that he didn't think Mary really needed to do that.
Tom seldom breaks his promise.
Tom dresses well.
"You aren't happy, are you?"
Why don't we just cancel the meeting?
Read that for me.
Your mother has made you what you are.
Tom straightened up his desk.
Put the car into the garage.
Tom claimed he was the son of a rich man.
We just need a plan.
I hear she is going to get married next month.
I bought you a present.
I have better things to do.
What's Tom going to do for Mary?
Tom usually accomplishes whatever he tries to do.
He has a good memory.
Why is it there?
I think that you're wrong.
Find Tom.
"These are Tom's, aren't they?"
Stop shooting.
How did it end?
Tom was invited.
She has no enemies.
She didn't expose her skin to the sun.
Let bygones be bygones.
The station is not far from here.
Is today your birthday?
He reads a great deal.
"Where are you, Tom?"
Tom isn't in prison anymore.
Tom's parents sent him to Boston because he kept getting into trouble in Chicago.
"Two adult tickets, please."
Tom begged Mary to stay.
"After an absence of ten months, he returned home."
Not all men are like that.
Don't shake the table.
Did you see their faces?
I shudder at the thought of what might happen.
I met a student from America yesterday.
Many Americans welcomed the plan.
I'll quit my job at the end of the month.
What do you think is down there?
Tom lives in a large house with a pool.
Tom is excellent.
Do whatever you want.
How long does it take from here to your home?
This book is too expensive. I can't afford to buy it.
Can you count to ten in Chinese?
I'll give these to Tom.
He was the leader of the movement.
"Even though Tom has never even tried eating one, he says he doesn't like kiwifruit."
He looks his age.
Tom was completely soaked by the rain.
Who said it was going to be easy?
Say goodbye.
Could I ask you a big favor?
I don't know how to thank you.
You were so sweet.
"It wasn't you, was it?"
"In general, women tend to live ten years longer than men."
Could you say that in plain English?
Have you heard from Tom?
He left the restaurant without paying.
"I'd like to study with you tonight, but I can't."
"Come on, wake up."
Why don't we take it with us?
Tom and Mary have gone their separate ways.
Dad is in the kitchen because he's cooking.
I'm happy tonight.
She can do 90 miles an hour.
Tom is very busy right now.
She's pregnant with twins.
Tom said so many times.
Tom doesn't live with Mary.
He came in spite of bad weather.
Empty the purse into this bag.
I'm the youngest child.
"How do you pronounce ""Wi-Fi"" in French?"
Your watch is similar to mine in shape and color.
Tom tried to distract the guards so Mary would have a chance to escape.
It's not as hot today as it was yesterday.
Didn't I tell you to close the door?
The bridge is under construction.
I showed my ticket at the door.
It took all night to climb Mt Fuji.
I stopped smoking and drinking.
Good luck with the new job.
"Even if you rack your brains over it, you won't solve it."
"Wherever you go, I will follow you."
I don't have any pencils.
Tom's French is improving.
Tom still hasn't come back.
Tom is by far the smartest kid in our class.
I can't help Tom with that.
How many times have you done that before?
The lake was frozen.
Who's your favorite DJ?
This tastes good.
The pain was unbearable.
Tom is a very rich person.
The group of noisy boys was getting out of hand.
I'd like to call him. Do you have his phone number?
He is wearing sunglasses.
They have no idea what I intend to do.
Tom doesn't have either a cat or a dog.
You must buy a ticket to get on the bus.
I'm not a Canadian.
How did you learn to speak French so well?
"People who don't work, won't be fed."
This is unacceptable to us.
I am sending the invoice by fax.
Tom sings off key.
Tom left the party at 2:30.
Mary was wearing a black sweater when I met her.
Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
Aren't you afraid?
Who is the tall guy with long dark hair playing the guitar?
Tom disappeared three weeks ago.
May I put it here?
I ripped the envelope open.
Are you attempting to bribe me?
We are looking into the cause of the accident.
"It was sunny when we arrived, but rainy when we left."
Tom was bitten by a dog when he was thirteen.
I can't make myself understood in German.
You had better not make a noise here.
It will be dark soon.
Few people will admit their faults.
You seemed bored.
He's doing his German homework.
I was having a bath when the telephone rang.
I don't know when Tom left.
Did anybody else see it?
Tom may be home.
Everyone attacked my opinion.
I recommend you to go by train.
I've never seen anybody die.
"Excuse me, but do you mind if ask your name?"
He is sure to win the game.
He had a blue jacket on.
We all had the same idea.
One wonders how it's possible.
I couldn't walk.
Tom likes to eat while he's watching TV.
I expected Tom to be late.
What's it we're waiting for?
I am not a Canadian.
He had a leg amputated.
"Tom can't stand the hot and muggy summers here, so he heads for the mountains."
Tom revealed his secret to us.
Don't deceive me.
Tom is fully aware of the problem.
They have no more wine.
I can't go to the movies.
Do you think Tom likes Mary?
Tom looks amazing.
Let's begin with this problem.
We want to see the king.
Did you live here?
Tom forced me to open the box.
I've never met a person that I've disliked immediately.
Tom is a boy's name and Mary is a girl's name.
"My father likes fishing, and so do I."
There's nothing worse than a long-distance relationship.
It's very white.
Did you go straight home after school yesterday?
I hope you are not catching a cold.
You must remain calm.
Please tell me your present address.
I don't have time for a vacation this year.
I don't know much about math.
Tom cried a lot when Mary left him.
Some bugs were fixed.
She will be able to swim soon.
"You owe me $1,000."
That doesn't belong in here.
Shouldn't we be doing something to help Tom?
Tom doesn't let his children drink wine.
Venus and Earth are almost the same size.
Tom came home after dark.
Many things have changed in the last five years.
It is no use crying over spilt milk.
Mary was amazed at how precisely Tom sensed how she was feeling.
"That's what I want, too."
That's my favorite blue shirt.
You must be new around here.
I will join you.
I thought for a moment Tom was really going to tell Mary about what happened.
Do you have time the day after tomorrow?
You are mistaken about that.
She did it in her own way.
I want to tell Mary I love her.
China is bigger than Japan.
I speak a little Japanese.
Remove your hat.
I think Tom likes his job.
I don't like meat. I prefer a vegetarian diet.
They started dancing.
I found out what Tom does for a living.
We came to the conclusion that he had been right.
That is what I have wanted to buy.
Tom was unaware of the danger.
We live near the large library.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to go out with him.
Tom was very late.
"Tom sat near the fire, playing his guitar."
I know exactly what you're feeling.
You must come back before it gets dark.
She went with him to the movies.
There were no roses in the garden.
"What are you doing here, Tom? Mary doesn't want to see you."
Do you think we'll win?
What's the catch?
Is Tom still sleeping?
How many Christmas cards did you write last year?
Tom stripped off his clothes and got into the bathtub.
I don't like this watch.
I wish I had more time to talk with you.
Do you want another cup of coffee?
I pressed my forehead against his.
You may invite whoever you like.
She showed me her room.
You deserved it.
Please come back as soon as possible.
Tom said he didn't have the courage to do that.
Tom enjoys himself at everything he does.
He doesn't like any sport.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
Don't touch me again.
He showed me his new car.
Are you still interested in learning how to speak French?
Why didn't you wake me?
I lived in Sasayama two years ago.
Tom stabbed Mary with scissors.
We now know that's not true.
Do you know what his name is?
Tom is beginning to irritate me.
You won't believe what Tom told me!
Vote for Tom.
She likes the teacher.
Tom let the cat in.
How many subscribers does this magazine have?
Tom started to feel like his life wasn't worth living.
Tom had to go to Boston on business.
Swimming in the pond is dangerous.
She parked her car in a vacant lot.
Are you a member of the baseball team?
"Who is heavier, Tom or Mary?"
He was given a gold watch as a reward.
What do you do with these?
"Like it or not, you have to go."
I'll see him next Friday.
Tom has told us quite a bit about you.
We have limited resources.
A parasol is used during the summertime to shade the face.
It's strange that he hasn't come yet.
When did you work in Boston?
I think it's worth a try.
I dislike being alone.
She goes jogging every morning before breakfast.
Tom says he can't ignore the smell any longer.
You might have an accident.
Don't be crazy.
"If I don't get the job, I'll tell Tom."
I escaped death.
I am good at math.
Whose beer is this?
I guess that's good.
I know exactly what you're doing.
What color do you like?
How did you guys meet?
Tom was assertive.
Tom said he'd kill me if he ever saw me again.
He doesn't seem to be a very intelligent boy.
Clean up this mess.
I have to say that I'm sorry.
Women are better at this than men.
Tom and Mary sat across from each other at a table in the corner.
Tom chased after Mary.
If only I had a pretty dress like that!
He always plays well.
Do you want me to wrap it up as a gift?
Is that what you're suggesting?
I've never heard Tom complain.
I want to stay longer.
I'm glad you noticed.
Have you asked the others?
Tom is on the day shift this month.
He treats his employees well.
"That's my job, not Tom's."
We should recycle more.
It's not necessary to write a long letter.
She is from France.
How did you get that nickname?
I hope you didn't lend Tom any money.
I'm going to take a bath as soon as I get home.
Tom let the cat out.
From which station does the train leave?
Do you have it?
Please air the room.
The soldiers occupied the building.
I believe I can handle it from here.
I don't have a date.
It's true that he is in love with her.
Tom is walking his dog.
It seemed that no one was in the village.
"He is short, but strong."
My brothers are already married.
Don't close your eyes.
It was just your imagination.
We know what you're doing.
I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
The truck Tom was driving slid on the icy road and crashed into a tree.
The doctor prescribed some medicine for her cold.
"Tom smiled, but didn't respond."
She's seventeen.
I tried to write down everything he said.
Tom let Mary play his guitar.
Tom is the only one who knows for sure.
His story was so funny that everyone could not help laughing.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
I have something to tell you.
Would anyone else like to say anything?
"Oh yeah, I remember that."
They want to better their working conditions.
Does Tom usually write to you in French?
I think it's better not to try it.
I checked outside.
Do you want to stop?
Tom and I talked about this three weeks ago.
I corrected myself.
He came out from behind the curtain.
They've seen Tom.
I know how difficult it is for you to admit that you are wrong.
I will give you the money tomorrow.
I thought Tom would figure it out for himself.
Do you have any beers from local microbreweries?
You need an interpreter.
Tom showed up at about 2:30.
Is this of any use to you?
The blind men walked slowly.
They paid separately.
Where do you come from?
Tom knows what's going on.
There's a slight possibility of a recurrence.
Tom is searching for something.
You've got the wrong number.
Tom hasn't bought bread yet.
He's no saint.
Someone is watching you.
It blew my mind.
Tom and Mary couldn't go on a picnic because it was raining.
Why would I fire you?
I'm sure my family is looking for me.
It's a done deal.
I began to sweat.
The U.N. building is very impressive.
How does Tom come to school?
Release Tom.
I'll be right behind you.
I had to stay in bed all day.
I think that we should forget about this.
It is never too late to learn.
Look at the contract carefully.
Don't ever mention his name again.
"No matter how many people tell Tom he made a mistake, he still insists he's right."
"I didn't want to come, but I had no choice."
This is food.
What do you do in your free time?
May I ask you some more questions?
His house was on fire.
I know you're working part-time.
She is a good tennis player.
How did you end up being Tom's manager?
I only have one condition.
What happened to make you laugh so much?
You're talking too fast.
I got up early enough to catch the first train.
I hope that you will like it.
It will be finished in a day or two.
The train is ten minutes late today.
Call it whatever you want.
I remember asking an old man the way.
Tom never wears a tie.
Tom is having a panic attack.
Please wish me luck.
My father's car is very nice.
It has been snowing on and off.
I went to Europe by way of America.
They were worried about getting caught.
I can't imagine life without him.
I just want this to never happen again.
Tom managed to put out the fire by himself.
I've come here to help you.
Tom would've helped us.
I'll warn Tom.
Nobody wants you to do this.
Am I in your way?
I'll be sixteen on my next birthday.
All her friends live in England.
This house is registered in my name.
Go back to your work.
Let's hope that common sense prevails.
She hid the letter carefully so no one would see it.
I won't let Tom thwart my plans.
Lower your voice.
No one is coming.
I'll go and get you a doctor.
We need to get rid of the guards.
I went to the park yesterday.
Tom hasn't changed a bit.
We thought his threat was only a joke.
I can't raise my right arm.
I'm buying a new car.
Here is a list of things you should avoid eating.
Tom gave Mary plenty to eat.
That's not my car.
I can name names.
Tom speaks French about as well as Mary does.
Have you tried it before?
"This time, I really mean it."
Flight 226 takes off at 10:30.
I play the guitar after school.
Tom and John pretended they were brothers.
It is said that she is a good cook.
I'm not quite sure yet.
I thought I'd go with Tom.
He wasn't so stupid that he talked about that in her presence.
Tom carried Mary on his shoulders.
I knew you'd be hungry.
Most boys like computer games.
Tom will probably like this game.
Tom asked Mary to meet him at John's house at 2:30.
Why are you so clumsy?
I thought I was doing the right thing.
Don't give me that!
Tom started to cry.
I'll be 30 this October.
"For this reason, I cannot go with you."
"Cucumbers, spinach, broccoli and onions are considered non-starchy vegetables."
A good management would listen to reasonable demands.
I'm the guilty one.
He must be crazy to say such a thing.
That was somebody else's idea.
Tom has always been shy.
I need to sit down.
My father often falls asleep while watching TV.
Be careful. It's very spicy.
It's a pity we can't stay.
What are you punishing them for?
I'm going to kill him for this!
"How's the world treating you, Tom? ""Pretty good."""
Please don't bother.
What makes you think that Tom prefers living in the country?
This bed is not comfortable.
I didn't sleep at all last night.
I never want to talk to you again.
All Tom told me was that he wouldn't be at the meeting.
I don't allow it.
Please give me another chance.
He wrote me a long letter.
Tom makes a lot of mistakes in French.
You are crazy.
Tom has his own bedroom.
I won't let you go alone.
His taste in music is superb.
Tom and Mary demanded better working conditions.
How many years have you been married?
There's just been another explosion.
Tom can't stand being interrupted.
I'm the expert.
Tom is muttering.
Tom is allergic to peanuts.
We swam in the sea.
I am prepared for the worst.
Tom and Mary named their daughter Alice.
Why are you being so kind?
I'll be ready in two minutes.
I'm not from a rich family.
You have to do this now.
My father has bought a new car.
Reducing the budget deficit is a major concern of the government.
Tom is trying to get custody of his sister's children.
I'll wait here till he comes back.
I don't want to come to Boston.
"He leaned over her and said, ""No, I'm not lying."""
"Being very tired, I soon fell asleep."
I am drawing a bird.
The water turned to ice.
Mary giggled.
"That man was standing a little ways away, but he turned when he heard Tom shout."
Tom may need help.
Tom wanted an economy car.
That's perfectly obvious.
She looks nice and healthy.
Tom put his things in his briefcase.
How do I get one?
Everybody who was anybody was there.
Won't it keep until later?
Here is your key.
She's grown up to be a beautiful woman.
I've spent my whole life looking for someone like you.
What's new with you?
I barely had time to think about it.
Tom kept coughing.
It's getting dark. Please turn the light on for me.
Does she like oranges?
My opinion is a little different from yours.
I will deal with them myself.
That's a possible explanation.
I didn't touch anything.
"Since I was sick, I didn't go."
It's not deep enough.
How are we going to do it?
Tom hurt me.
Tom saw Mary catch a fish.
Why are you so sure Tom told Mary about what happened?
"Sorry, I didn't hear you."
I knew your brother.
I bet my bottom dollar he is innocent.
Is Tom your nephew?
My zipper stuck halfway up.
He bragged about it.
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long.
It was the first gold medal that she had won.
Tom can't understand why Mary is angry.
He keeps making the same mistake.
I'm not done with you yet.
"At the party, one of his political opponents humiliated him in the presence of many guests."
Be reasonable.
Can I get your help with something?
My mother stopped her sewing and picked up her book.
Tom took the bait.
Tom was hit by lightning.
I sometimes watch TV.
This letter is addressed to you.
We adopted Tom.
"The minute I entered the room, they stopped talking."
Tom can't believe Mary.
I'm really grateful.
Tom really enjoys his job.
I didn't know Tom had a horse.
They missed the deadline.
I'm sure it would be a mistake to tell Tom.
He's a stand-up guy.
I have seen him many times.
We have a new puppy. He is about 12 weeks old.
This novel consists of three parts.
I will do it on condition that I am paid.
I've got a surprise for you.
I thought I could count on you.
Tom was walking.
It seems to me that the pictures speak for themselves.
Mary was very beautiful when she was a teenager.
"Frankly speaking, this novel isn't very interesting."
Do you know how to ride a horse?
"Listen to your father, Tom."
Sorry to be late.
"Tom is coming to the party, too."
It doesn't matter what she said.
They won't believe me even if I swear it is true.
My money was stolen.
I could hardly believe my eyes.
We should drink 64 ounces of fluids a day.
Tom said he doesn't plan to go by himself.
You don't have to hide anything from me.
All we know is that Tom is coming to our office at 2:30.
This machine is too heavy for me to carry.
I saw Tom a few minutes ago.
I am the tallest in our class.
Is it possible to buy the book at the bookstore in Akita?
They kept it to themselves that the king was dead.
Tom didn't want to talk about Mary.
"You have a son named Tom, don't you?"
He threw a stone into the lake.
They left without me.
Tom is writing again.
Boil some water.
We know who did it.
"Tom looked at Mary, but said nothing."
My brain is full.
This story sounds very unlikely to me.
Most of what you just said is true.
Life ain't easy.
Most of what you just said is true.
I don't want to do this.
It came to nothing.
We're not the only ones who've made mistakes.
Tom sounds worried.
Tom didn't see a thing.
Do you want to become a father?
I wish I could talk about it.
Do you really want to lead this kind of life?
Your son is an angel.
Tom is cooking.
My sister saw it with her own eyes.
She advised him to stop drinking.
Do you have a motto?
Tom left before I arrived.
My boyfriend sometimes flirts with other girls.
There was no furniture in that room.
Tom is very calm.
I haven't seen you in three years.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
Tom is going to pick me up at 2:30.
Ask me something easier.
I don't know which doctor she meant.
Do you talk to your dog?
Tom is a hypocrite.
Do you think I look like Tom?
I can't stand loud music.
Tom looks shocked.
Please don't tell Tom about what we did.
I had something else in mind.
Someone told me Mary left her husband.
Tom hugged Mary and gave her a little kiss on the cheek.
Tom and Mary are dependent on each other.
I was alone in the classroom.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
"Day after day, the dog sat waiting for his master in front of the station."
They regarded him as a national hero.
He likes to hunt.
You are tallest.
I am very pleased with my new house.
They each received a present.
The correspondent filed a report from Moscow.
Tom opened the envelope and took out the letter.
Give me back my wallet.
"The soldiers fought valiantly, but finally they had to give in."
When did you start learning German?
I nearly got hit by a truck today.
I'd like to watch TV.
I think you're both pretty good-looking.
He was first elected to the Senate in 1984.
I have a lot of friends here.
Tom's not in the office.
That kid was almost run over when the truck backed up.
Did you ever really love me?
She married a rich old man.
You may use my car.
I have nothing to open the can with.
Tom picked an apple from the tree.
The dress was trimmed with lace.
The days are growing longer.
Tom isn't looking.
I envy him.

Tom and Mary held hands and watched the sun set over the ocean.
We should probably ask Tom first.
The train was delayed because of heavy snowfall.

"We were sitting peacefully at dinner, when all of a sudden the lights went out."
Tom can't keep his eyes off Mary.
I was just making sure.
I'll read it to you.
"All of a sudden, he proposed to me."

We depend on you.
Tom will probably visit us tomorrow.
We use public transportation.
I should go with you.
Swallows are flying in the sky.
Tom dreamed about Mary.
They offered it to me.
Tom called Mary to see how she was doing.
There are a lot of trees around the pond.
You should have attended the meeting.

No one understands you like I do.
Tom wakes up at 8 a.m. every morning.
We knew Tom wouldn't be late.
Tom's really enjoying his new job.
Konrad Adenauer was the first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.
I've already told Tom that he should do that.
Please let me know.
They needed one another.
Tom felt strong.
We all want prices to fall.
Does your mother know?
It was lucky for you that you found it.
Remember these rules.
Tom knows he's not supposed to help Mary do that.
This isn't about me or Tom.
Are you still up?
I regret that I told you.
All three doctors agreed on the diagnosis.
Are you OK with this?
It's an artificial flower.
Will we be the only students taking the exam tomorrow?
I'm younger than I look.
I liked that book.
Why are you acting this way?
My cousin is getting married tomorrow.
"He used to eat out every day, but now he can't afford it."
I'll stop you.
Tom has a wonderful voice.
Tom walked over to Mary and hugged her.
What's all that racket?
My seat is in the third row. Where are you sitting?
I don't know where she lives.
Tom doesn't watch TV.
I have a feeling that wasn't too difficult to do.
Tom's hairline is receding.
The poor girl went out of her mind.
Tom took some things out of his bag.
Life is strange.
I always went to Miami in the summer.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
Tom is a pushover.
Who surrendered?
I think it's still worth a try.
Try these on.
Whose book is this?
I'd like you to meet my wife.
My situation is hopeless.
I lost a valuable medal.
You woke me.
I think you know what I think.
A little bit of luck sometimes leads to an unexpected success.
Where did you eat last night?
I hope it works.
Mary didn't have a husband.
Do you care what other people think?
Tom kept Mary waiting for three hours.
Boston is my home now.
I'll leave it to you to buy the tickets.
I don't want you to worry.
They think I'm a millionaire.
Choose one person.
Tom knew that Mary was tired.
I'm tempted to just stay in bed.
Get Tom.
I should've been more specific.
You shouldn't judge a man by his appearance.
They say that he was born in Germany.
Tom and I've been friends a long time.
What are you and Tom going to do for your anniversary?
I had fun.
We should make use of atomic energy.
Allow me to go with you.
Give me something to write with.
His speech was too short.
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
The door is opened every morning.
You made it happen.
He acts as if he were a king.
Tom is untalented.
This one's for you.
Tom has already won.
Tom died in October of 2013.
Two pages of the book stuck together.
"Tom, here's someone I want you to meet."
That thought crossed my mind.
The crime rate is decreasing in Canada.
The cat played with the toy mouse.
It suddenly started raining.
Tom bought a mask and a snorkel so he could go snorkeling with his friends.
I want to go to America someday.
Raise your hand.
Tom has a picture of his dog on his desk.
She entrusted her husband with a letter.
Tom once owned a lot of land.
I agree with you on this issue.
She tried not to cry.
Your question is very hard to answer.
Where were you when Tom needed your help?
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped to buy a chocolate bar.
What does that have to do with you?
"Have you taken a bath yet, Takashi?"
Please tell me how to get to the bank.
I was impressed by his magic tricks.
The town grew into a city.
Tom used to go to school with Mary.
I can feel it.
You need a new hat.
Tom is an evil person.
Do you have everything?
Tom always sets two alarm clocks when he's catching the early morning flight.
My father sometimes goes abroad.
Tom's body has been cremated.
Did you really think I wouldn't learn the truth?
That's hardly surprising.
I can't believe my eyes.
"Everybody needs food, don't they?"
One thing I've always wanted to do is run my own restaurant.
When exactly did you get here?
Can you please reduce the volume of the music?
"Asked if he was happy, Tom said that he was."
Who quit?
"Hey, you can't leave now."
They heard it on the radio.
Get some rest.
Have you checked the oil level recently?
I know what Tom would say.
Have you seen any movies recently?
I'm drafting a plan.
I am no longer tired.
He scraped the mud off his boots.
We've achieved a lot in the past three years.
I've been practicing.
She and I usually agree.
Please keep your cynical remarks to yourself.
You have to choose between honor and death.
I thought you were already in bed.
I like talking.
He's always clowning in class.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I'm not all that drunk.
Mary ironed Tom's shirts.
I felt naked.
Give me a piece of chalk.
Where is the bathroom?
Tom thought it would be difficult for Mary to get a ticket to that concert.
Tom told Mary that John was sick in bed.
I can't bring myself to trust his story.
We want to live here.
"When I hear this song, I think of you, and miss you."
Tom spent Christmas in jail.
He's intelligent and good-looking.
"When he finished speaking, everyone was silent."
She is busy preparing for the trip.
Tom has lots of things he has to do.
Tom lives in a wealthy neighborhood.
This bag is mine.
I want you to love me for who I am.
Did you call him up yesterday?
Is this your umbrella?
He has a son and two daughters.
Why don't you answer?
Do you have any pictures of Boston?
My grandmother on my father's side has turned one hundred.
"What I want isn't tea, but coffee."
Tom said he'd prefer that you not do that here.
That man is definitely a bachelor.
I don't think people use that word anymore.
Don't come.
She is dressed like a bride.
She's teaching us French.
I must resist.
Today is Monday.
Do you have a spare key?
All our attempts failed.
We're saved.
"Tom, do you have school today? ""No, classes were canceled because of the typhoon."""
Did you ask your mother?
You need me more than I need you.
Tom may not make it.
She practices the piano every day.
This is the best kushikatsu restaurant in Osaka.
Does this make any sense to you?
Tea was introduced from China.
He studied military history.
That sounded good.
Human beings differ from animals in that they can think and speak.
I've seen a lot.
He had friends all over the world.
"Every time I looked at him, he was yawning."
Tom has a reputation of never getting things done on time.
"Considering all I've eaten all day is just one slice of bread, I'm not really all that hungry."
Do you have a sister?
We have less than two hours until the deadline.
What time did you get to sleep?
"Tom is terrified, but Mary isn't."
Is your headache gone?
You're taking this too personally.
Will you dance with me?
Kunihiko hit the target with his first shot.
Did you go out last night?
I want you to go to Osaka at once.
He makes a point of attending class meetings.
Tom suddenly felt tired.
I don't have anywhere I need to be.
I don't think everyone is here yet.
I have to charge the battery of my car.
Tom bumped into Mary the other day at the supermarket.
Did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters?
I only threatened to shoot Tom. I didn't shoot him.
We don't have enough time.
Tom doesn't think it's such a big deal.
How do you spell your family name?
Tom ate my cookies.
I have never seen such a thing.
She is just as charming as her sister.
He hasn't written to them in a long time.
You seem to like fruit.
We know it was our duty.
That's part of my job.
Don't thank me. Thank Tom.
There wasn't a single survivor.
The mother was reluctant to leave her children alone.
She earns more than she spends.
It is written in simple English.
Help!
I have only just begun.
I'd like to know why you were late.
The line is busy again.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
Maybe we need to get a watchdog.
The lion is the king of beasts.
It's as clear as crystal.
It tasted good to me.
I am thirsty.
Would you like me to explain it to you?
I think you've got the flu.
Don't say his name.
Hard work really does pay off.
Everyone started waving their flags.
We should've phoned ahead and reserved a table.
It's an easy victory.
Tom has bigger hands than me.
Do you have a vacant apartment?
I thought you said nobody knew about us.
I can't wait for him any longer.
Tom scribbled something on a piece of paper.
It won't amount to anything.
Tom avoided answering Mary's question.
The border is closed.
I think I've made myself clear.
I thought you enjoyed swimming.
Tom can't explain it.
You're not telling me anything I haven't already heard.
Tom is hammered.
Tom means exactly the opposite of what he's saying.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
That's very considerate of you.
He slammed the door right in my face.
This photo was taken in Nara.
Follow your dreams.
Why do people like golf?
We trust him.
Why are you always so suspicious?
He lost sight of his friend in the crowd.
She wrinkled her brows.
Look at the sports car over there.
He seems to be having trouble breathing.
We're soul mates.
What's Tom going to say?
"He loves her. She loves him, too."
The movie was a lot better than I expected it to be.
Can't we just go home?
Tom waited until Mary was out of sight.
I suppose so.
I can tell by the look on your face that you're not interested.
Are you enjoying the view?
They're boys.
Everyone needs to quit whining.
The army quelled the rebellion.
That's OK with me.
It's just down the street on your left.
Few treasures are worth as much as a friend who is wise and helpful.
I know you didn't want Tom going to jail.
How long's it going to take?
That was a good sign.
They want to help.
Tom put his luggage into the overhead bin.
I was kind of expecting that to happen.
I wouldn't count on that happening.
You didn't have to do it straight away.
He is studying in the library now.
Some people want to amend the constitution.
I sympathize.
There's nobody there.
Make me happy.
I have some money.
Everyone agrees it was the right decision.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is looking for.
The door opened.
I don't want this anymore.
No one can help you.
I am afraid.
Did you receive my package?
"As he talked, he got more and more excited."
I don't need glasses anymore.
My wife and children depend on me.
It wasn't planned.
I tried to get Tom to help Mary.
Are you a perfectionist?
I want some water.
It's very easy to learn how to swim.
The accident resulted from his carelessness.
It's hard to achieve happiness.
They'll be looking for you.
How many people were aboard that ship?
I am not acquainted with him.
Tom is a successful salesman.
I'm not done with you.
Tom is energetic.
Can you feel the difference?
The queen stood beside the king.
What my mother had said was true.
I had all my clothes washed by my mother.
Tom caught three fish.
He is now on the way to recovery.
They're drenched.
You have a good camera.
Tell me about it. I'm all ears.
Tom evaded the question.
"I'll wash the dishes. ""OK, I'll dry then."""
He was elected mayor.
I feel like going for a walk this morning.
I still have your key.
I've spent most of my life here.
Tom died of cancer in October.
Tom usually gives good advice.
Where does it hurt?
Tom put gas in the car.
I don't want to do it like that.
I still don't see it.
Tom doesn't smoke cigarettes.
Tom died before the ambulance arrived.
I do my homework after school.
We stayed there for three months.
"Do it now, Tom."
She passed by without seeing me.
Tom smiled.
Don't get off the bus till it stops.
Tom admired Mary.
This dress is cheap.
"In the alphabet, B comes after A."
Let's play tennis after school.
This is going to be easy.
I'm just cleaning up.
The girl playing the piano is my sister.
He taught himself French.
Tom moved to Boston three years ago.
"We can't add days to our life, but we can add life to our days."
I'm replaceable.
These objects are very useful.
Tom and Mary loved each other.
All you have to do is fill in this form.
Let me ask you a simple question.
I know Tom had nothing to do with that.
The bus was ten minutes late.
Tom is driving the car into the garage.
Is that singer popular among your friends?
Are you seriously thinking about going?
She married him.
She herself helped him.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
"Mary isn't as beautiful as her sister, but she's still quite attractive."
"Don't run yourself down, Tom."
Your suitcase is too heavy.
Tom doesn't have insurance.
I think this tie will go great with that shirt.
Tom found his glasses and put them on.
Let's stop this fruitless argument.
I must work hard to pass the test.
There are many old men in this village.
Tom lives in his car.
Please lend me the video when you have seen it.
Tom has never been skiing.
I don't need your permission.
This book deals with life in the United Kingdom.
He was educated at a public school.
I think it's wrong to lie.
Has anybody here been to Hawaii?
Tom listened to music in his room until late at night.
She quit smoking.
I played catch with my father.
I can afford it.
Mary and I plan to have two children.
I wouldn't want you to think I was mean.
"I sold the picture for 20,000 yen."
They said such mean things about me.
There's a white building just around the corner.
"The American news is reporting that Hurricane Irene is as big as Europe, which is a bit of an exaggeration."
Tom got better.
I accept gifts.
I don't know English.
Tom can play the guitar.
I think you've got me confused with someone else.
He came from a tiny mountain town.
He works all night and he sleeps all day.
I never realized how hard it must be to be a woman.
She needs someone to talk to.
The typical Japanese person doesn't speak English.
I live here.
I'm in no particular hurry.
Tom loses his temper easily.
We almost didn't make it to the church on time.
I want to spend the whole day with you.
Tom was cheerful.
Tom smiled mischievously.
The road to the village is very rough.
She likes to go to the sauna.
Please put those chairs away.
My watch must be slow.
He'll win for sure.
You've got to be on your toes.
You still haven't told me why you quit your job.
I don't know because I wasn't there.
I know you're going to say no.
He died last year.
Would you mind watching my kids?
Have you tried it yet?
There's snow on the roof.
How far is Boston from Chicago?
The food was nearly inedible.
She is living in the middle of nowhere.
Tom always agrees.
How long have you been teaching English?
That's for you to decide.
My room number is 5.
Come on in here.
How can it affect them?
I'm not here to help you.
What should you do to decrease your debt?
Do you have a cell phone?
I won't tolerate your mistakes again.
I enjoy the challenge of translating the untranslatable.
I'm not watching.
Ants have a well-organized society.
Tom has changed a lot since then.
Are you guys going to be OK?
He saved no less than ten thousand dollars.
Tom had nothing more to say.
This cat is very fat.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I'm studying very hard.
We need additional staff.
He cannot be trusted.
Did you enjoy yourself at the theater?
It's no problem.
It's very nice of you.
Do you know where Tom got this?
"What languages do you speak, Tom?"
I want to speak German.
My father bought me this hat.
I am following that car.
I have a feeling that something dreadful is going to happen.
We'll get it.
Mary is wearing a low-cut top.
I had a premonition that something wasn't right.
It is nice and cool here.
Call me if there's a change.
It's already too late.
I want to know that what I'm doing is right.
Why didn't you ask me?
I demanded that he pay the debt back at once.
Tom really hoped that Mary would go to the concert with him.
That's not exactly true.
The street lights went on.
Tom and Mary helped each other with their homework.
I wish I could write as well as Tom.
I wonder if Tom knows where my umbrella is.
He was wearing glasses.
She came to Tokyo when she was 18.
Try to be patient with others.
That seems weird to me.
Supplies cannot keep up with the demand.
I always try to be honest.
I can't tell you what a disappointment it was that Tom didn't win the race.
I didn't know that someone was watching me.
I just wanted to warn you.
The temperature outside is four degrees below zero.
Just stay close.
It can be confusing at first.
"I'm sorry I am late, but there's been a lot of work to do."
That was hard to believe.
"As the crow flies, it's about 20 miles from here."
I'm just saying it's a possibility.
You should eat something before you go.
What kind of bird is this?
Which eye is hurting you?
Almost all the doors were closed.
It needs to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom remained a bachelor his whole life.
Tom's pitching is pretty good.
Where's the rest of your family?
I thought maybe you'd changed your mind about going to Boston.
I'd forgotten that you'd forgotten.
This is a nightmare.
I found it extremely upsetting.
We've been asked to help.
There is an urgent need for money.
I'm walking because my bicycle has a flat tire.
May I be excused from tomorrow's class?
I like chocolate ice cream.
I'd appreciate your help.
Everybody dies.
Would you check this?
Do you speak Albanian?
Tom is not a cat person.
I'm an ex-marine.
I'll be OK.
Turn off the TV.
We never had any problems with it.
Tom disagreed with Mary on that point.
He showed me her picture.
He is loyal to his boss.
I get by.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Is Tom lying?
How many meeting rooms do you have in this building?
"To hear him speak English, you would take him for an American."
I bet it works.
"In accepting the money, he lost the respect of the people."
They were really cold.
How do you know what I'm thinking?
Why isn't the ship moving?
Give it a try.
I want to pick out a present for my friend.
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
Tom backed up his data.
I can't attend the meeting.
Tom has never asked me for money.
They went whale watching.
Tom and Mary got back together.
Tom enjoys movies.
I don't want to tell Tom the truth.
Tom gave us that.
Tom didn't want me to become a soldier.
You said it!
Who doesn't write love letters?
How did you get into the house?
Photography is an expensive hobby.
"My father rarely, if ever, goes out on Sundays."
"Thanks for understanding, Tom."
"I have four computers, but two of them are so old I don't use them anymore."
Grandmother looks after the children during the day.
"I have 1,500 head of cattle."
Why are you being so nice to me?
That is a boat.
I expect you to be there.
Tom is taking a rest.
Tom is at school right now.
Both his father and mother are dead.
Does anyone in your office speak French?
Tom had to stay in the hospital.
Why is this computer here?
We'll survive.
I bought this for my girlfriend.
The new tax law is full of loopholes.
Tom said he needed three hundred thousand dollars.
Something's obviously wrong here.
Tom never talked about it much.
You don't have to make up your mind right now.
I saw him walking around town wearing his Sunday best.
Where did you see Tom?
I felt isolated.
Tom is the perfect gentleman.
Tom is a lot like his brother.
Shut your mouth.
Tom fainted.
You have something on your face.
You know who they are.
Forget about Tom.
Do you think we'll have a white Christmas this year?
He is no longer living here.
Are you going to take part in the English speech contest?
Please choose wisely.
He tried in vain to lift up the stone.
She went inside.
He's a little taller than you are.
Why are you so quiet?
"If it were not for plants, we wouldn't be able to live."
I didn't expect that to come from you.
Is it true they're planning on raising the minimum wage?
That's quite a problem.
She devoted all her energy to studying Spanish.
He speaks too fast.
We prefer to do our own work.
What was the diagnosis?
Those flowers have died.
I wasn't able to attend the meeting due to illness.
Bring all your friends next time.
What does all that mean?
Why did he have to wait for you for so long?
We don't study French.
He gave me a bad cold.
You need to learn to listen to our advice.
Tom should've told us about that earlier.
Let's have some fun.
Tom has trouble admitting that he's wrong.
What actually happened?
Tom loved his children more than anything.
She is in a bad mood.
Don't you ever say anything?
I cry every time I hear this song.
Tom likes chocolate very much.
Tom never liked Mary very much.
Have a cup of milk. It will do you good.
I knew who did it.
How well did you know Tom?
"Next time I come, I'll bring you some flowers."
She kept me waiting for over an hour.
How did you know I was Canadian?
We haven't had much rain this year.
That's Tom.
This is Tom's handwriting.
Tom wondered why Mary looked so sad.
We must water the flower.
What's asphalt made of?
I didn't know you had company.
I study psychology.
I have many friends I can talk to.
I forget his name.
Tom gave orders.
The spy made contact with the enemy.
"Come on, help me."
Mind if I join you guys?
I want revenge.
I'll take care of it.
Tom cut the apple in half with his knife.
You should write Tom a note.
"I had planned to stop at the supermarket on the way home, but it was closed."
Tom cheated.
Tom likes to tell dirty jokes.
She's lost her car key.
When did you buy your car?
You can help.
Tom is studying.
The top of Mt. Fuji was covered with snow.
Water is more expensive than beer at this restaurant.
We received instructions on how to make a bamboo basket.
Tom hung the laundry in the backyard.
I want him to be informed about that in advance.
He is a man to be reckoned with.
Can you break an egg with one hand?
I laid down for a short nap and fell asleep for two hours.
We don't get on well with each other.
Tom is a madman.
Tom is a very good basketball player.
I'm particularly impressed that Tom could remember all of our names.
Tom is depressed because his girlfriend left him.
I didn't see it coming.
Let's share the money.
I take back what I said.
Write your full name.
This work is by no means easy.
I'd like to ask Tom that myself.
Nothing much is happening yet.
Tom must be very tired.
The girl smiled at me.
I heard Tom singing in the shower.
"If I were him, I wouldn't put up with it."
Isn't it true that you visited her on the night in question?
I may never walk again.
That cost a lot.
Do you mind if I watch TV for a while?
We made pancakes for breakfast.
Here you are.
Tom doesn't have a car.
I wanted you to see that I'm not all that bad.
She was not a very good pianist.
Aren't you curious?
He's nervous and excited.
He took the public by surprise.
Their oldest daughter isn't married yet.
I think I have an idea.
I'd like to come to see the doctor as soon as possible.
Tom must be very happy after winning the race.
He doesn't care for sweet things.
Tom likes to play baseball.
"Tom laughed at some of Mary's jokes, but he thought some of them weren't very funny."
Can I make a credit card call on this public phone?
Nobody likes being laughed at.
I gave the books to this student.
I'm so happy to see you again.
They married when they were young.
Do you know what PKO stands for?
I deserve an explanation.
Ask Tom to do that.
Tom keeps a hunting knife in the trunk of his car.
This is just too big to carry.
Look at that one there.
She has a bike.
It is really nice of you.
He's going to cross the river.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom touched Mary on the shoulder.
That's pretty significant.
Aren't you from Boston?
"This one's crowded, so let's take the next train."
"Tom threatened me. He said if I didn't give him the money, he'd cut off one of my fingers."
Tom always tries to help others.
Are my ears red?
His suggestion is worth considering.
I am at school now and I will stay here until 8 o'clock.
The automobile stopped.
Preserves must be stored in a jar with an airtight seal.
Tom knelt down.
Our dog has been poisoned.
Tom sat on his bed crying.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
Will you help me for a minute?
I was away from home all through the summer vacation.
Tom has never cut his own children's hair.
She got engaged to him.
The exchange rate of the dollar versus the euro has declined.
I did that because I felt it was necessary.
She is looking for a large apartment.
I love you just as you are.
I use an electric toothbrush.
You've done so much for me.
Let's do our best.
I thought it would make him laugh.
Would you please leave?
It's really dark in here. I can't see anything.
The identity of the boy who had been missing was verified by the clothes he was wearing.
You should take care of your sick mother.
He tends to get angry when people oppose him.
The old woman is a doctor.
Can somebody open the door please?
Tom looked very happy.
They say everybody gets what they deserve.
"Last night, I fell asleep while talking with Mary on the phone."
That's possible but highly unlikely.
It'll be fine.
Tom is only a couple of years older than Mary.
Can't you just ask Tom to help us?
I caught more fish than Tom did.
Tom will come back.
I've already told you what I think.
I am interested in sports.
He was looking for a good job.
I want to catch the six o'clock train to New York.
The cherry blossoms are at their best now.
Find a job.
How did you spend your summer?
Don't read what's in the envelope. Just give it to Tom.
Tom is going camping next weekend.
Can we go over there?
I do not feel guilty.
Can't you see we're busy?
Tom acts like nothing else matters.
You're in love.
Tom is a professional wrestler.
I can't undo it.
All the kids at school made fun of me because I was fat.
Tom borrowed mine.
Is there space for one more person?
Are the Niagara Falls far from your town?
You're one of the most brilliant people I know.
Can you tell me where Tom is?
"They survived, even though the building was destroyed."
He is very fast.
That store had to reduce their prices.
Can I rest a bit?
A boxer and an actor are coming toward us.
I am happy to spend money on books.
Tom was absent.
Our car ran out of gas after two minutes.
Tom hummed along with the song.
Time is on their side.
Could you come back a little later?
Tom put the map on the table.
We do almost everything together.
The village needs your help.
Tom drives a truck for a living.
Pick me up at 2:30.
We have a lot more in common than you probably think we do.
I gave them clothing and some food.
Just apologize.
You are to finish this work by the end of this month.
How did you manage to talk Tom into working for you?
I've got it.
It is foggy.
I haven't walked to school in a long time.
Tom outlived many of his friends.
"Come on, Tom, show us how it's done."
I have to leave you.
Someone stole Tom's bicycle.

Is this not a good time?
"It's a hard, dirty job."
I will be sixteen in May.
Teach me how you do it.
Take as many cookies as you want.
How hungry are you?
Tom wasn't able to get his car started.
I can't believe Tom quit his job without talking it over with Mary first.
I'm just shocked.

I looked for the key.
Tom asked me to tell you something.
That was a mistake.
Tom didn't want me to go shopping with Mary.
I don't know and I don't want to know.
I will wait here until he comes back.
His sister is a real beauty.
Tom made us feel unwelcome.
He's afraid of dogs.
The cat is inside the box.
Germany of today is not what it was ten years ago.
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
Tom pretended to be my friend.
My car is German.
I'll take care of it personally.
I'm married now.
Tom didn't change his mind.
Tom doesn't seem to be very tired.
Are you going to school tomorrow?
I'm sure Tom will understand.
Tom says it's up to you to do that.
"I've always loved you, Tom."
Tom hopes the charges will be dropped.
I haven't seen Tom.
Women hate me.
Tom tried to open the door.
Tom can't even sharpen a pencil.
Tom kept trying.
Tom is missing.
Tom had expected something quite different.
"When you disembark the flight, you will go through passport control."
All of us except for Tom thought Mary was guilty.
I know how busy Tom is.
Tom will be a good teacher.
Tom came here for the money.
I would've said no.
What does that tell us?
I'd like to leave early.
How's that again?
I think Mary was the prettiest girl in our class when we were in the third grade.
He knows this town inside out.
He is on night duty tonight.
A lot of English words are derived from Latin.
"I didn't understand anything, either."
We're not going anywhere today.
Tom doesn't like to talk about his work.
All contributions are tax deductible.
Take mine.
You're good at that.
Will you be ready to leave tomorrow?
That's where I want to be.
I don't have books to read.
"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
Do you really want to know what I think?
What have I missed now?
I loved you.
What direction are you going?
I'm alone now.
My grandfather was wounded in the war.
I hope to see you.
Tom can't make it to the meeting.
The job isn't anywhere near done.
Tom is a science teacher.
He reached his goal.
Tom rarely wears a tie.
The Americans surprised the Germans.

This castle is beautiful.
My grandfather will be seventy this year.
Do you want to hear the truth?
He bowed to me as he passed by.
I would like to help you.
I'll look it up.
Tom kicked Mary.
Tom finally spoke.
I could hardly hear what Tom was saying.
I'm afraid you're right.
My uncle works in this office.
We're starving.
I started studying French a few weeks ago.
Do you know what they want?
This is plagiarism.
Tom didn't understand Mary's joke.
I'm leaving.
I have five times as many stamps as he does.
I convinced him that he was wrong.
I never want to see you again.
It was very kind of you to lend him some money.
I know this must come as a shock.
We are going to have a baby.
Tom had a thoughtful look on his face.
Thank you for attending this meeting.
How are you holding up?
Tom doesn't smoke anymore.
I quite agree with you.
"If you can't keep your promise, what excuse will you make?"
There isn't any need to speak so loud.
He tried opening the door.
Tom handed his son a lollipop.
What's wrong with your dog?
You sure have a beautiful garden!
Did you know this already?
Please leave your message on my answering machine.
Mary's my niece.
He is a dependable boss.
Does Tom like his job?
I haven't downloaded the file yet.
I simply cannot put up with her manners.
Tom explained it.
I've never told anyone that before.
They are plotting to kill the king.
My room is always clean.
I am taking French next year.
How did the party go?
I found out where Tom used to live.
I thought you said someone was going to meet us.
I only have time for coffee.
What is it you're afraid of?
Have you ever donated blood?
We can't keep pretending that Tom doesn't have a problem.
May I use the shoe polish?
We must phone the police.
"Will you pay attention, please?"
You're the same age as my girlfriend.
Only two people survived the earthquake.
Tom is fluent in three languages.
I'm counting on you.
He forgot to lock the door.
How could you not tell me you know my parents?
You always said you wanted to learn French.
This story was inspired by true events.
Tom's answer surprised me.
I feel bad today.
Put the flour on the shelf.
Tom gave Mary a pair of diamond earrings.
We're coming in.
Tom buried the stolen money in his backyard.
"Tom is never here in the morning, is he?"
I called my lawyer.
I wonder why my computer crashed.
We flew nonstop from Osaka to Los Angeles.
I wish I had married another man.
I'll be with Tom.
I'm not frightened of anything.
Would you like to play with us?
Tom can't stop looking at Mary.
They were swearing at each other at the top of their voices.
There is no smoke without fire.
He still loves her.
What part of Canada are you from?
He showed his album to me.
She lives alone.
That was Tom's personal opinion.

The teacher is Chinese.
My parents expect me to enter the university.
Open this door.
"May I have a napkin, please?"
It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella.
Is it here that the bus stops?
Do you know where he went?
This book isn't as interesting as that book.
Do you want me to give you a hand?
I'm just a farmer.
Don't walk away from me.
He lives near my house.
Tom put a cup of coffee on the table in front of Mary.
Don't waste your allowance on useless things.
Do you have enough information to go on?
He doesn't mean to be mean. It's just his nature.
They don't always obey their parents.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
Which way is the beach?
Listen a minute.
"My mom was very strict, too."
Tom's divorce from Mary reportedly cost him more than a million dollars.
Where will you stay when you go to Boston?
Does the hat fit well?
Do you have any pencils?
I would like to move to Australia.
What are you selling?
"Good night, Tom."
Tom didn't seem to remember Mary.
Tom is barely able to stay awake.
We'd better cancel the hike.
I'm sorry to hear about what happened to Tom.
"Excuse me, I dropped a chopstick."
Tom could smell Mary's perfume.
Maternal love is greater than anything else.
Please turn off the gas.
Tom is a good friend of Mary's.
Maybe Tom didn't do what everyone says he did.
That day shall come.
He never speaks of the accident.
That's about it.
I feel like someone is watching us.
Tom parties too much.
Why did you buy the flowers?
I don't have the address with me.
Can Tom see us?
The man couldn't so much as write his own name.
"Your cat isn't very affectionate, isn't he?"
How long does it take to walk to your house from here?
Would you care for some more cake?
Some things are better left unsaid.
Let me pay for your coffee.
My camera is the same as your camera.
I'll teach you how to write.
I have a house that needs painting.
I don't want to hear it.
Did you get that ticket from Tom?
The show was very interesting. You should have seen it.
I asked Tom to help out today.
Good luck. You're going to need it.
Is it safe to eat this?
The sky is clear almost every day.
"If you're cold, come here and sit down by the fire."
He received quite a few letters this morning.
It wasn't cheaper than any of the other stores.

He seldom orders anything new.

I was victorious.
Tom is off duty today.
Try it on.

Please write to me as soon as possible.
Who'll drive?
Did you tell Tom that?

"Tom can't remember all his passwords, so he keeps them in a list disguised as phone numbers."
My son can neither read nor write yet.
Nobody was helping us.
Tom is calm and patient.
Please turn off the light.
I don't understand what you are saying.
How come you know so much?
Don't forget your ticket.
Tom can't leave now.
He was punished for his crimes.
The island is situated five kilometers off the coast.
I'll be watching you.
His lecture had a large audience.
I have a little money with me.
I suppose I ought to apologize.
You'll find both of the books interesting.
Is your school far from your home?
I can't wait to visit my grandmother.
You might at least say thank you.
Tom knows no French.
I just don't want to be reminded of it.
What do you call this flower?
Do you think we will get there on time?
Have you ever gone sailing with Tom?
I'll be there tomorrow.
"Sorry, I couldn't catch what you said."
Tom could've killed somebody.
I'm going to bed.
We obeyed the rules.
She went blind.
Tom was clowning around at the party last night.
Might I ask you a question?
I wish I could stay longer.
I'd like that.
I think it's time for me to get a new pair of glasses.
There was something weird about the incident.
You are very brave.
No one has ever said such things to me.
Why do people tell lies?
Tom shared his chocolate bar with his friend.
Have you read the owner's manual?
Tom cheated on the history exam.

Tom is grinning.
Where will you stay in Boston?
A car hit Tom.
Let's not ever do this again.
How long were you in Boston?
I bought a dictionary.
The president is out now.
Is this the right way to the station?
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
This is never going to end.
Do you want to touch it?
I wouldn't rule it out.

"Could you pass me the salt, please?"
I don't like such sports as boxing and hockey.
It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
"He puts on a show of being impartial and unbiased, but I think he's just a guy with no opinion of his own."

There were some students in the classroom.
We're out of time.
They don't want you to know.
Are you looking for something?
Do you talk about us?
I'm afraid we can't rule out the possibility that she may have the disease.
What makes you think I'd want to see that?
How fast were you driving?
I haven't talked to anyone lately.
Tom has to stay in bed.
I wish he were here.
I'm going to go get dressed.
Get down!
Money isn't everything.
You will do no such thing.
Who is your godmother?
I will speak to you tomorrow.
You'll change your mind.
Tom is wanted by the police.
You look fine.
Don't let Tom leave before I get there.
She told me the wrong address on purpose.
Texas is almost twice the size of Germany.

Don't you want Tom to know you were right?
Tom said he wanted some company.
I do not have a sister.
I don't see Tom doing that.
I didn't know you were a poet.
Does Tom know you work here?
The mayor's office is in the city hall.
What is it you're afraid of?
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
My son won't listen to me.
He is very honest.
Take the children inside.
Tom is going to do that for Mary.
I can't necessarily agree with you on that point.
Tom parked the car across from Mary's house.
Tom doesn't want to go there alone.
She lied.
Tom doesn't know what this is.
I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom wins.
This is a really bad time. Could you come back later?
I hate Tom's guts.
I'm just about done.
Tom is home again.

Adjust the microscope's focus.

Tom will be glad to see you.
The bill is due on the 1st of next month.
Tom knows this.
You shouldn't eavesdrop.
I don't understand why you hang out with Tom all the time.
We left Tom alone.
I don't know what is worse.

Was the movie good?
Why do you keep giving him money?
She has shoulder-length hair.
I am watering the flowers.
My uncle said that he jogs every morning.
Why does Tom want to go with us?
Did you know he bought a condominium?
What's your favorite shampoo?
You've walked into a trap.
How many languages do you speak well?
He was fortunate to find the book he had lost.
His arguments don't convince me.
Only a few TV programs are worth watching.
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a wedding dress.
Tom seemed stupid.
He ran too fast for us to catch up with.
Are you free tomorrow?
Many restaurants and pubs are on Itsutsugi Street.
We confirmed the hotel reservations by telephone.
Tom went alone.
She filled her bag with apples.
Are you looking for anything in particular?
I only left Tom one message.
It's too ugly.
The radio doesn't work.

Are you still living with your mom?
Sign above this line.
It's a pity you can't come.

He emptied his glass.
Stay with Tom.
Tom was watching Mary and John.
Tom didn't mind helping Mary do the dishes.
I got him to polish my shoes.
Would you please lower your voice?
Tom means nothing to me.
He is looked up to by friends.
Tom understood exactly what Mary wanted him to do.
I guess we could try doing that.
That's a good question.
"It doesn't make much sense, does it?"
Tom appeared confused.
You're a hypocrite.
You had better go and speak to him in person.
Tom is a tall man.
He's not smart enough to add numbers in his head.
I have seen a UFO.
I'm not saying that.

Can you manage to carry the suitcase by yourself?
Have you ever warmed yourself by a fire?
Tom wants to sleep on the beach.
Wait up.
I'll tell you an interesting story.
Tom has two children.
Did Tom tell you why?
It was stupid of me to believe that!

Just tell me what happened.
Please add up the numbers.
Tom can't forget the day he met Mary.
I don't speak your language.
I want to get a sightseeing visa.
"Everyone knows what they have to do, right?"
There wasn't a single book in the room.

Did you sue Tom?
Are you feeling tired?
It sure is cold today.

This is a violent neighborhood.
Tom should've won the race.
I mean it.
You must not go up the stairs.
They are my cousins.
I suspect that Tom doesn't do his homework by himself.
They are having lunch in the garden.
I left Tom a message this morning.
I don't think you're heartless.
Your mother will repeat it to you as many times as necessary.

She knew neither his address nor his phone number.
"Because my mother was ill, I could not go there."
Tom said he decided it was too difficult to do.
Human life is sacred.
I don't think I have the time to help you today.
I've known you for years.
Why are we still talking about this?
You're one of us now.
The children were sliding on the ice.
Tom won't resign.
I like tea.

Stay cool.
We will talk over the matter later.

I ran as fast as I could to catch the train.
These are my CDs.
She took the shawl off.
We have come a long way.
We've run out of tea.
Tom chose to ignore Mary's remarks.
That's something to be proud of.
She tore his letter to pieces.
Tom signed a confession.
"At last, the truth was revealed to us."
I have to get home.
"How far is it from here to the station? ""It is about two miles."""
You decide.
Anything could happen in a place like this.
Tom and Mary rented three camels and a guide to take them into the desert.
Isn't it the other way around?
Nothing is as simple as it seems.
How long will you stay here?
Do you have school on Saturdays?
"Because I didn't know what to do, I asked him for advice."
I guess it was a joke.
I felt out of place.
You shouldn't have brought Tom with you.
Let's try another approach to the matter.
He was lame after the fall.
Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark.
Tom spends too much time playing games.
I can't wait till summer.
Would you like to see my stamp collection?
How is that possible?
I stepped on Tom's foot.

Tom grew up in a small town not far from Boston.
Do you really think that's fair?
Let's cross the street.
I have a lot of work still outstanding.
I expect you to be punctual.
Tom seems hungry.
You've been suspended.
Tom is extremely violent.
I'm making popcorn.
The Tokaido Line was crippled by the typhoon.
I never do that.
That's not something you forget.
You're confusing me.
Please pick me up at the hotel at six o'clock.
Did Tom say where?
Tom is never on time.
She made a wonderful speech at her friend's wedding reception.
How many apple trees do you have in your orchard?
We expect him tomorrow at ten o'clock.
He loves nightclubs.
I wish I had been with her then.
Tom is intelligent.
Tom never talks about his work.
"Oh, don't worry about that."
Women like men with mustaches.
I knew you were behind this.
"Except for Tom, everyone laughed."
He writes to his mother every now and then.
That may not happen.
Tom saw Mary do that.
It was all for nothing.
Please don't change anything.
Will you tell me how to spell the word?
Thank you all for coming.
No one knew who he was.
I once lived in Rome.
He didn't need to bring an umbrella.
Tom thinks he's being shadowed by a private detective.
I thought I was losing my mind.
He froze in his tracks.
Whoever guesses the number wins.
He will do anything to make money.
You know where I live.
I don't have a bathing suit.
Close your eyes.
Some people don't act their age.
"Even though Tom begged Mary not to go, she left with the children and went to live with her mother."
"I thought you liked him. ""I do."""
Why do you always wear that hat?
Our company supports several cultural events.
I hate not winning.
Tom is here because of me.
I washed my hair this morning.
"In France, a great amount of wine is consumed."
"Please, tell me."
The war is going in our favor.
Why is everyone looking at us?
Are you quite sure about that?
Money doesn't always bring happiness.
That will put you in danger.
Tom couldn't catch up with the other students after he came out of his coma.
I'll be right there.
Tom seems tired tonight.
How did you arrive at this conclusion?
"After supper, I washed the dishes."
"Don't worry about it, OK?"
What's the title of the book you're reading?
You can't hypnotize me.
I didn't see any tigers.
They didn't kill him. They just roughed him up a bit as a warning.
Read it to me.
Investigate the cause of it.
This word is new to me.
There are a lot of people here.
Don't you like Boston?
I've been alone on this island for three years.
That's just your imagination.
I found what I was looking for.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary planned on doing.
I think you've asked enough questions.
Tom is never afraid of anything.
The ladies' room is on the third floor.
Why don't you ask me what you really want to know?
Tom refused to go to the hospital.
Give me a second chance.
I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye.
What's your email address?
Tom went and shut the window.
All we need is a few more volunteers.
Tom wrote a love letter to Mary.
It is by no means an easy job.
You shouldn't depend on others too much.
Tom is still overweight.
She cared for her sick father.
I know what to study.
Give that to him.
What're you going to do?
There's fruit and meat in this market.
"In politics there are no friends, only partners."
Tom heard the scream.
I'm sure Tom intended to do that.
"What he said about girls holds true of boys, too."
Let Tom know there will be dancing at the party.
Why don't you have any clothes on?
Wet clothes cling to the body.
I have nothing else.
Mary has beautiful long hair.
"Where are my glasses? ""You left them on the kitchen table."""
I can do this.
I don't think it's good.
Japan is an industrial country.
B is the second letter of the alphabet.
I don't think it's true.
I was unable to write down the number of the car.
The police arrested the burglar.
I'm afraid you have to work overtime.
You probably don't have as much time as I do.
You amuse me.
It wasn't planned.
I'm there for you.
He was a little old man with thick glasses.
I always study hard.
Is Tom good at swimming?
Do you want to use mine?
Tom pushed me into the pool.
You need to get out of the house more.
Tom tended to the horses.
I'm the one they want.
My clock seems to be broken.
Do you know those people?
Do you see him often?
Who's picking up the tab?
I've got a flat tire.
Just be yourself.
"Tom is going to Mary's birthday party tomorrow, isn't he?"
The weather was very bad yesterday.
He translated a Japanese novel into French.
I guess it's time to leave.
Tell Tom to get back here as soon as he can.
English is spoken in many countries.
It'll rain soon.
They aren't here yet.
I love lasagna.
I saw you crying.
"He said nothing, which made her angry."
I don't care what it is.
I know you are rich.
Can you break this thousand-yen bill?
That girl isn't able to ride a bicycle.
I don't need your permission.
Nobody listens.
My brother is very tall.
I'd like to show you something.
You're the girl of my dreams.
Tom just watches.
There are plenty of rocks.
I'm not even Canadian.
I often talk to him on the bus.
I can hear someone talking in the next room.
Is there a hospital nearby?
He made a grave mistake.
Someone's coming.
You'll want to see this.
This is the house he was born in.
The prices here are a bit high.
I felt like crying.
I'm done with my chores.
Tom got wounded in the battle.
I'm being watched.
How could you be so cruel?
Tom and Mary were sitting on the couch together.
What are they asking you to do?
He lost a book.
Why do they do this?
What should they do in this situation?
She bought a chicken.
Would you like a banana?
I know you'll be happy here.
Don't tell Tom where you live.
Get out of the car.
"The more I think I about it, the less it pleases me."
You'll be missed by your friends.
I require your assistance.
I made him carry the suitcase.
Tom didn't know anything about Mary.
We ate bacon and eggs.
I met him yesterday for the first time.
I located the town on the map.
He always invites himself for dinner.
Tom and Mary probably don't know each other.
Tom threatened me.
Meet me there at midnight.
Water is leaking into my goggles. I don't think they fit right.
I don't study after school.
I'm supposed to see Tom.
Take the dog for a walk.
I wanted to make a good first impression.
Tom tried to stay calm.
We shook nuts from the tree.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Tell me the reason why Tom was fired.
He said that he had arrived there that morning.
Eating too much fat is supposed to cause heart disease.
I learned a new trick.
I expect him to come at any moment.
Tom wants to say goodbye.
Might I ask your name?
"Tom is now on vacation, isn't he?"
I've never met a Canadian I didn't like.
I guess that she is over thirty.
I've just returned from a trip.
My mother tried to reconcile the couple.
We can't afford this.
Tom and three of his friends went camping last weekend.
"Line up by height, please."
I don't want anyone to miss this.
I have no plans whatsoever.
Tom often helps Mary.
"In America, many people have fences around their homes."
I can't see a way out of this.
I want to drink some water.
Why don't you watch TV?
Don't cry over spilt milk.
Were you invited?
Tom looks like he's fine.
Please accept my sincerest condolences.
Is this what you want?
It's bedtime.
I have lots of work to clear up by the weekend.
Tom seems clever.
I got up at six-thirty this morning.
We had to walk home.
That's all you can expect.
Why did you come early?
Have you ever been to Mexico?
I'd like to hear what you have to say on this.
She is still a girl.
You don't want Tom to think you're stupid.
Your pulse is normal.
Why does Tom do things like that?
I'm doing this for you.
This is not something that anyone can do.
Go away!
I didn't ask Tom to go there.
I like the blue one. How much does it cost?
This milk has a peculiar smell.
Is that OK with you?
Tom says you can fix anything.
Tom got married to Mary.
He crossed the Pacific Ocean in a sailboat.
This room is cramped.
Please beat the eggs.
There's something wrong with me.
Tom didn't want to go to the doctor.
The Swiss consume a large amount of beer.
I made up my mind to be a doctor.
Tom said it was too cold.
Tom didn't stir.
This poison is very effective in getting rid of roaches.
I hope no one saw me kissing Tom.
Can you open it?
I recognized her by her fiery red hair.
Spring is the time to plant trees.
Her jokes made us all laugh.
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
I went to the zoo.
I know what you're doing.
Tom has lied to us.
My dad bought a model plane for me for Christmas.
Tom looks slightly uncomfortable.
Tom is disloyal.
Tom is painting his fence.
Give me a hand with this refrigerator.
Tom's leg had gone to sleep so he was unable to stand up.
I've always hated you.
Do you want another one of these?
Tom was mistaken.
The cost of living has shot through the ceiling in the last year.
They'll understand.
I'm too ashamed.
Tom knows where you are.
Tom didn't have the heart to tell Mary the truth.
She became an actress.
They went to Chicago by car.
Tom is one of the thirty people who were asked to leave.
Why do you keep provoking them?
You've just got to try harder.
I'm not going to ask you again.
My sister is always weighing herself.
I am 24 years old.
The ship was flying the American flag.
My book has to be somewhere in the room.
He is afraid of the dog.
I think I'll take that one.
We named our only son Tom after my grandfather.
I'm giving it back.
I'd ask Tom to do that.
Have you heard any good jokes lately?
Everybody had looked on him as a good-for-nothing.
Tom and Mary got married three years ago.
Tom has a heavy German accent.
Do you prefer reading to cards?
What a great idea!
I'm not getting any younger.
Telephone me if it rains.
It's the same every time.
"Weather permitting, we will leave in an hour."
The forest fire began to spread in all directions.
It's a fact of life.
I wonder why Tom is tired.
Tom did that three times.
I thought that Tom was in Boston.
I need to know by tomorrow.
Help is always appreciated.
It was a partial success.
Tom works very hard.
Tom is looking for a job.
Tokyo is larger than Yokohama.
Tom suddenly blushed and looked away.
He's a talented writer.
I canceled.
Tom knocked on Mary's door.
Did that answer your question?
Tom spoke only French.
You should have kept your mouth shut.
This letter's for me.
What time did the meeting end?
Tom was dissatisfied with the service at the hotel where he stayed.
"It's a privilege, not a right."
Do you want me to go?
They say that he was in the hospital at that time.
I don't know if you remember me.
I have looked for it up and down.
This is surprising.
Tom is hurting.
Please take one.
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
Pay attention to everything Tom says.
Tom is grouchy.
We'll talk business later.
Tom was very busy today.
You're nervous.
I'm no longer angry at you.
Mother set the table for dinner.
This chemical is extremely dangerous.
We're happy to see you.
Tom tried to guess Mary's weight.
Tom took out a loan in order to buy a car.
Who's the happy couple?
I have a wife and family.
This probably means war.
I would like to meet him.
"When I woke up, he was gone."
I've got a proposition for you.
Tom removed his socks.
My father has a personality disorder.
We are blinking our eyes.
I'll stay here.
I've seen it a million times.
The people in the other room are speaking French.
Strawberries sell for a high price in the winter.
Tom refused to stop eating meat.
I want you to stay.
"If I had known that you were here, I would have come at once."
"Tom is from Boston, but now he lives in Chicago."
Don't you want to do that with Tom?
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.
The old man got in her way.
We miss you a lot.
Tom proposed to Mary and she accepted.
Tom takes piano lessons.
I'd rather stay here.
I saw my grandfather last week.
"You want me to go, don't you?"
"You are tired, aren't you?"
That poor lady is disabled.
Could you please give this to Tom?
When did the Thirty Years' War take place?
You're just jealous that I have a boyfriend and you don't.
Tom thought it might be a trap.
Her mother will continue to work.
He pretended not to hear me.
It's easier to teach children than to teach adults.
I'm very sad.
It may snow.
Tom wanted that.
I'm going back to the synagogue.
Do you want to find out?
Does it need to be this way?
Don't let this ruin your friendship.
Keep the window closed.
We should leave nothing to chance.
Tom asked Mary to wait for him in front of the library.
That has nothing to do with you.
You don't need to know how it works.
Which bed do I sleep in?
I hate guys like that.
Expect me when you see me.
The president abolished slavery.
I'm doing this for you.
This is my old bicycle.
This book has a lot of pictures.
What time do you expect me to be there?
My sister has a sweet tooth.
I am playing a computer game.
My goal in life is to be a novelist.
It was on sale.
I thought you two would have a lot in common.
He committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
Did you love Tom?
I feel very ill.
Is it hard to learn French?
It's balmy today.
I know you're right.
She harbored the deserter.
How did you spend your summer?
Why don't you have one?
No one will believe him.
Tom wanted to know everything about me.
You're blushing like a schoolgirl.
I've got a message for you from Tom.
I'm Tom and I'm an alcoholic.
Can we try something else?
He talked to the chairperson.
My mom yells at me all the time for no reason.
Perhaps Tom knows something that we don't.
I'll take these with me.
They manage to get along without much money.
Why did I get a D?
He looks healthy.
You should know yourself.
What school did you go to?
Do you know how dangerous that is?
Why don't you just do it?
I wonder whether Tom likes Mary.
Do you think you're obese?
It is difficult for him to solve the problem.
"Tom and Mary were speaking in French, but switched to English when John entered the room."
I think a glass of wine would help me calm my nerves.
She found a ball in the garden.
"Tom, I'd like you to meet someone."
That wasn't a coincidence.
Tom doesn't spend much time in Boston.
Tom will be back at 2:30.
Could someone please help me?
That could've gone better.
I've had enough to eat.
What am I going to do about it?
Tom eats more food than Mary does.
She goes to market every day to buy things.
Tom has no idea who Mary is.
I was never in love with Tom.
Can you help me wash these dishes?
Tom is such a jerk.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
Tom just returned from Boston.
What would you do without me?
He was the only witness of the accident.
That must be the Mackintosh boy.
Certain restrictions may apply.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Tom is the one who caused the accident.
Barely a third of the population in this country have access to the Internet.
What did you do last night?
I don't want Tom to come here.
He was in good spirits.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
She's sometimes late for school.
Tom woke Mary up at 6:30 as she had asked him to do.
I'll call the police.
I am not busy now.
Tom didn't know that Mary was already married.
That's where you're wrong.
I thought you didn't want to talk about this matter.
Hokkaido is in the northern part of Japan.
I'll leave the planning to you.
"Tom is young, but he knows what he's doing."
We have more apples than we could eat in a day.
Don't act like you're so innocent.
Tom asked me to leave the room.
I stared at the man.
He wanted to test his limits.
I chose to leave instead of staying behind.
Tom's car has run out of gas.
Ireland and England are separated by the sea.
How did Tom convince Mary to marry him?
I want to get as far away from here as I can.
He is a naughty boy.
Can you show me on the map?
It sounds strange.
Are you forgetful?
Tom does like you. I'm sure of it.
You should go.
Tom sweated.
They know where we are.
Could you open the window?
Tom had to do it.
His advice is of no use.
Is the anesthesiologist there?
He is from France.
Tom stepped on some broken glass.
What's your take on this?
I'm not good with names.
I had a special ticket.
Be like me and have a glass of wine.
They've increased the salaries.
We have a mission to accomplish.
Tom said the soup was too hot.
Do you go to church?
He is faced with a difficult problem.
I'll show you how.
Money cannot buy freedom.
Allow me to explain.
I've never seen you like this.
I don't think Tom sees it that way.
Do you still need our help?
Edison invented many useful things.
"Of course, to be valuable, an old carpet must be in good condition."
Let's not waste this chance.
The last volume is missing from this set.
It was very sensible of him to reject the bribe.
Even Tom doesn't do that.
You should consider moving to Boston.
They are used to the humid climate of the summer.
I'll visit you sometime in the near future.
It makes perfect sense.
Just give me what I want.
I have a lot of money in the bank.
I'm still a little hungry.
When did you come back from London?
Tom and Mary got married after they graduated college.
Tom was surprised by what he saw.
Many Americans still had money they had saved during the war.
Tell Tom I don't like him.
Do you have any apples?
It's Tom's group.
The cat is very cute.
I don't want them to take advantage of me.
What happened out here?
They love coffee.
Tom had never realized just how lovely Mary really was.
How many milligrams are you taking right now?
I'll do that at 2:30.
Tom couldn't get to sleep because he had drunk too much coffee after supper.
Asians eat a lot of rice.
Be vigilant.
Tom seems wise.
This is too hard a problem for me to solve.
Tom hid behind the curtain.
I found a nice tie for you.
Why didn't you go with Tom?
What have you done with the books?
She hasn't come here yet. I am afraid she may have lost her way.
They stopped walking.
She likes humiliating people.
You should read between the lines.
I think you shouldn't have done that.
Who are we?
The house stank.
I can't stop you.
I went shopping with a friend.
I haven't seen Tom for days.
We were flooded with applications for the job.
They can't hear you.
She's in total denial about her husband's philandering.
Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo.
He is trying to quit smoking.
Tom always tries to avoid trouble.
Can I take a message?
He began to cry.
It doesn't look like we'll get paid this week.
Both of my parents are not strict with me.
We were all exhausted.
She showed her courage in the face of danger.
My French teacher is the same age as I am.
They don't know my name.
Tom has a heavy workload.
How did you come by the money?
I have not been busy since yesterday.
I said yes.
I was lucky that I was able to find a good babysitter.
"Even though her vet told her not to, she continued to feed her dog raw vegetables."
"Tom seldom, if ever, eats meat anymore."
Tom is just a friend of ours.
The bills keep piling up.
You must be able to speak either English or Spanish in this company.
I don't know her telephone number.
Ask him about it.
Drop your gun!
I suddenly realized that my watch was gone.
Tom wasn't naked.
Whales are similar to fish in shape.
Go and look for Tom.
I agree with Tom on this.
Why don't you just go home?
"Each year, twenty-seven million acres of the tropical rainforests are destroyed."
My daughter's your age.
Tom says he needs to ask Mary where she put his camera.
I know you're going through a lot right now.
Things are looking good.
Have you heard the latest news about the war?
Why do you want to know?
Where's the teacher?
She played the guitar and he sang.
He stole a glance at the girl.
Her hair is turning gray.
May I go home now?
Tom will obey.
I love your son.
You must go up the hill.
Tom doesn't want to have to fight you.
"As soon as she met him, she burst into tears."
Tom and Mary are planning to have a house built after they have their first child.
"Tom threw rocks at Mary's window in the middle of the night to get her attention, but he ended up breaking her window instead and Mary's father called the cops."
"If you want me to stay, just tell me."
"Tom told Mary that he was going to kill himself, but he didn't have the courage to do it."
You have no need to be ashamed.
We don't have to be here.
Does that make you happy?
Tell me something about your country.
It is you who is to blame.
You've broken your arm.
Airplanes enable people to travel great distances rapidly.
Doesn't that sound good?
"Just a moment, please."
Tom and Mary have decided not to talk to their children in French anymore.
The budget of the film was very limited.
"You're afraid of him, aren't you?"
I didn't let them know.
I am well.
Don't push your luck.
Tom'll cry.
I can't get this work done by anybody.
He asked his friend for advice.
What kind of play is it?
I'm really not supposed to do this.
Why didn't you help Tom?
I am frying fish.
Tom said that he didn't know you.
The color is purple rather than pink.
How old is your dog?
Tom told me Mary's secret.
I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
This is the third longest river in the world.
"That wouldn't be Tom, would it?"
Who have you helped lately?
I have nothing else to add to that.
You didn't have any choice.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
I love math.
She speaks English fluently.
Tom has no classes at all on Monday.
We had some good times.
Can you cook an omelet?
I didn't want to scare you.
Tom can help us.
Just close your eyes.
If you only knew what kind of a situation I am in.
I swear I didn't see Tom.
The negotiations fell through.
Tom follows Mary on Twitter.
Tom knows what he's doing.
What's your plan for the day?
Are you free on Tuesday?
I'm a Canadian.
I'm mad at you.
Does that make any sense?
Tom is frugal.
This is all I know.
My parents picked me up from school.
That's too long.
That didn't really happen.
It's possible Tom didn't know about the meeting.
There's a bottle of white wine in the refrigerator.
They cannot be saved.
Worrying isn't going to help.
We ran into each other at the station.
Our marriage is over.
Are you all right?
Did you even notice that Tom had left?
"I'm studying French, too."
Tom is wearing the same clothes he wore yesterday.
Which of the two ways do you choose?
He may have been right.
Tom doesn't do anything without his wife's permission.
Bring your student ID!
"Although it rained, everyone had a good time."
I want to do this for Tom.
We really have no choice.
Have you been to Boston before?
Tom said he'd do that.
The word yes never escapes his lips.
His dog barks at me.
These shoes belong to me.
Let me think for a while.
I avoid going there late at night.
Tom wants change.
Tom looks hungry.
I was speechless with emotion.
"If you push this button, the door will open."
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Is his name really Tom?
Is this a river?
Tom was found dead in his hotel room.
How long does the airport bus take to the airport?
Tom's not happy with that.
I can't count the number of times Tom has complained about that.

This is good for us.
I'm going to Florida for the winter.
I keep a diary every day.
Tom laughed at my suggestion.
Tom overstepped his authority.
I usually have a glass of milk for breakfast.

How do you know those guys won't try to kill us?
Look what I did.
This song sounds sad.
Do you know anyone who hums while they work?
I know Tom better than he knows himself.

I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I wish all my problems would go away.
You'll feel better after a bath.
Tom had his hair cut short.
Tom and Mary stayed up late talking.

Thanks. You've been a big help.

Tom is working as a software engineer.
Lend me the binoculars so I can see it better.

What's Tom doing up there?
I no longer have a headache.
What's Mary's maiden name?
That's how I know.
I will get in touch with you next week.
Tom sat between Mary and her husband.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
Is this what Tom wants?
She is out now.
Do you get along with your boss?
Tom already ate.
A little soap and water never killed anybody.
Tom's daughter is sick.
Did Tom tell you why he wasn't at school yesterday?
I took the liberty of calling her.

We can't tow this car.
You're escaping.
I have known her for two years.
Tom told the boys to line up.
Tom invited Mary to a party at his house.
I ordered you to get out.
Don't hesitate to ask for advice.
This is a crazy world.
This is going too far.

I don't see why we had to buy all the food.
I'm unnecessary here.
I'll be with you.
How about this one?
I'm pulling the plug.
It was like a bolt out of the blue.
She has two thousand books.
Will you lend me your bicycle for an hour?
Please tell me where to park my car.
Did you figure this out on your own?
This is good for me.
Tom was my first boyfriend.
Tom had no right to do what he did.
Do you want to go home now?
The lawyer has a lot of wealthy clients.
Tom is a very talented musician.
That's the crux of the matter.
"If you travel by Shinkansen, it doesn't seem far from Nagoya to Tokyo."
I won't forget what you did.
"I have difficulty understanding abstract modern art, especially Mondrian."
"She may be late, in which case we will wait."
Please don't misunderstand me.
Who looks after the children?
Tie your shoelaces.
The new plan worked well.
Tom saw Mary running.
I feel good.
Is there anything we can do to help?
I don't care what you say.
"Tom walked into the courtroom, surrounded by police officers."
That's your responsibility.
Let us know if anyone else comes into the theater.
Are you here on holiday?
Tom often thought about Mary.
It takes courage to succeed.
Don't ever wear that tie again.
You know you were right.
It is in the kitchen.
Nobody was listening to the speech.
"Without your help, we couldn't have done it."
This is the tricky part.
I like the smell of freshly-baked bread.
Is something wrong with your eyes?
Keep me posted.
The eel I caught last week is still alive.
Look at the picture on the wall.
Did you find what you were looking for?
You've done a lot of good.
Give me the keys.
It is never too late to learn.
Tom has a dentist appointment at 2:30.
I'd like to live in Boston.
He asked her where she lived.
I meet him sometimes in the club.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Do I really have to give a speech?
I'm your age.
I don't usually write this kind of song.
We're back home.
Tom doesn't speak French well and I don't either.
They refused to help us.
Who invited you to the party?
I seem to have done something wrong.
Tom claimed that he saw a UFO.
This is what Tom wants.
I'm very thirsty.
I need ice.
Tom sat next to Mary on the couch.
Leave me some ice cream.
I heard her singing in her room.
I saw the whole thing.
I think everything is ready.
Tom won't respond.
Stop shooting.
I hope I'm not interrupting you.
Can I play your mandolin?
"It appears you're correct, Tom."
You'd like it.
I'm ready to go.
My dream is to live a quiet life in the country.
My neighbors are very nice people.
Tom obviously knows his stuff.
Try it once more.
"In times like this, we should all pull together."
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to get rid of it.
Is Tom a good person?
Can you help me to translate these sentences into Chinese?
Tom didn't appear.
He reached for the book.
I've got plans.
Tom says that he needs to talk to you.
Is eating whale meat wrong?
Tom is driving a Toyota.
Let me pay for your coffee.
The world isn't perfect.
What did you do this time?
She was successful in the attempt.
Tom eats anything that Mary puts on the table.
Tom got out of the car.
There is a man waiting for you at the door.
I can't keep doing this.
Nobody wants you to do that.
Is that even a real word?
The brass band played three marches.
I'm inviting you.
"You're used to that, aren't you?"
Leave my camera alone.
Did Tom meet the criteria for passing this class?
That's correct.
All but three of the cars in the parking lot were white.
I'm a redhead.
She has changed a lot since high school.
Be a little more careful next time.
You're a filthy liar!
The summer here is quite warm.
What are we doing?
"Even though my friend was a vegetarian, I didn't tell him that the soup had some meat in it."
Tom suggested that they convert the old church into a concert hall.
"When my wife's friend comes to visit, I find it hard to get a word in edgeways."
Is Tom a member of the swimming club?
I don't know what you do.
The ship was flying the American flag.
Mary is Tom's sister-in-law.
I used to be a dancer.
I am losing my patience with you.
Everything remains as it was.
His concert was great.
Tom was behaving like a spoiled brat.
They're quiet.
You just got lucky.
It's night.
"I suspected that he was telling a lie, but that didn't surprise me."
Tom has no desire to learn how to speak French.
"You know who I am, don't you?"
Here's what we don't know.
I'm only going to say this once.
Have you picked out a name yet for the baby?
"Whose earrings are these? ""They are Tania's."""
I have a master's degree in music education.
What fruit would you like to have for dessert?
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
It's now your turn.
I am not always free on Sundays.
You should've been here.
He will be here all evening.
Tom is obsessed with power and money.
We didn't stand a chance.
I'm not going out.
Our project failed.
We've got to help them.
Soldiers go on patrol in a military vehicle.
I don't like you anymore.
Tom is a stranger here.
Get out of my bed.
I don't know why I even bother anymore.
The supplies are beginning to give out.
Please help me with my homework.
He seemed to like that.
I'll ask Mary out.
All the students were there.
They need new shoes.
I don't care much for coffee.
I've still got a lot of work to do.
I have a lot of things to tell you.
I can't talk about it right now.
I was counting on you.
Are you the new assistant?
I'll do the talking.
Let's just try to have a good time.
Tom will try to talk Mary out of it.
He has gone mad.
I want you to stop doing that.
Do you know how to drive?
Tom studied after dinner.
I graduated from university last year.
Tom has started coughing heavily and I'm worried about his health.
It was a complete failure.
We had no idea what we should do.
She is very anxious about your health.
I'm not related to Tom.
Tom doesn't know how to play chess.
Don't be so mean to me.
You looked scared.
Tom had to stay in the hospital for a week.
I'm Tom's dad.
Who recommended Tom for the job?
This bookcase is easy to assemble.
My grandfather cannot walk without a stick.
Ask Tom if you don't believe me.
I am heating the room.
"It might sound far-fetched, but this is a real problem."
The students could not answer.
I'll help you wash the car.
She passed the examination.
There is a fly on the ceiling.
Who told Tom?
She lost her locker key while she was swimming in the pool.
They ought to have arrived there by this time.
I'll be nice.
I hope I don't have to use this pistol.
It would be confusing.
We have to reduce the cost to a minimum.
We have the same barber.
I don't like women like that.
Tom's building something behind his house.
Why do you walk when you have a car?
This plant is good to eat.
He is angry with you.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
I am from Ecuador.
That's what I'm thinking.
Tom is a little slow on the uptake.
Tom gave Mary the key.
It is hard to adapt this story for children.
Would you like to go see a movie or something?
I will keep your advice in mind.
Don't fall in love with me.
I have more books than I can read.
Do you want small bills or large?
The cost of living in Tokyo is very high.
Take the oranges out of the fridge.
She stammers when she feels nervous.
I am a teacher of English.
No other mountain in Japan is as high as Mt. Fuji.
"Because it was very cold yesterday, I stayed home."
Our baseball team is very strong.
Certain things are better left unsaid.
He joined the baseball club.
Have you forgotten everything we've done for you?
Tom looked up at the ceiling.
It was overcast yesterday.
This town is increasing in population.
Tom's mother always told him he should eat more vegetables.
Stay out of my business.
Tom's hair is chestnut brown.
"Surprisingly enough, he turned out to be a thief."
You're very different from us.
I want to go out.
I don't think I like that.
Tom was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
The whole world speaks English.
I saw fear in his eyes.
You'd be crazy to ride a bicycle without brakes.
We must ask the bank for the loan.
Tom asked me if I was all right.
The sun will soon set.
The medicine has to be taken every six hours.
What day is it today?
Tom thinks you should talk to Mary.
He is an English teacher.
Tom is still looking.
"He, and he alone, must go."
You're very well respected.
We will get to Tokyo Station at noon.
I greatly appreciate your advice.
The school is closed because of the snow.
They called the dog Rocky.
Tom became depressed after Mary left him.
It won't be long before we can travel to Mars.
Tom has three cars.
What was left?
What time do you arrive tomorrow?
May I do that with Tom?
That's the house I used to live in.
Tom is capable of doing it.
This is what he said.
I have read twice as many books as he has.
"He loved me, but he doesn't love me anymore."
Are you awake?
Try it once more.
You can't hurt my feelings.
"That was, as it were, part of the job."
"On a first date, it's best to steer clear of touchy subjects."
Mary was wearing a new outfit.
Tom felt sick.
I've never been so embarrassed in all my life.
What's your username?
Tom's favorite movie is Dumbo.
She went to the airport to see him off.
We'll get you out of here.
New York is a big city.
Surely there was something we could've done.
Did you see the solar eclipse yesterday?
I gathered from what she said that she liked him.
I strolled along the streets to kill time.
The earth is round.
Are these your things?
We must go there whether we like it or not.
It snowed a lot last year.
You two should stay together.
What was the question?
The strange object in the sky could be seen with the unaided eye.
He argues about everything he's told to do.
That happens to me all the time.
Tom doesn't know what Mary's doing now.
When do you think you'll see Tom?
I'm passionate about my job.
You don't know what it is to be poor.
He had his car stolen in broad daylight.
Let me repair it.
Tom cleaned the room.
Tom is now up.
The psychologist asked me a whole battery of questions.
You could have told me.
Give me a chance to make you proud of me.
I'm trying to solve the problem.
Tom and Mary are waiting for John and Alice.
You'll go far.
Couldn't you go someplace else?
Have them come in right now.
When do you drink coffee?
Why don't we try doing this again tomorrow?
The first step is always the hardest.
We got involved in a traffic accident.
Tom takes the trash out every day at six o'clock.
Tom complained that his wife was spending too much money.
I imagine that Tom and Mary will eventually get married.
It's not real money.
The actor died at the height of his popularity.
Can I help you find something?
Her unusual behavior caused our suspicions.
Tom rewrote it.
You're quite mistaken.
Tom knows more than he's letting on.
I wouldn't want to live in Boston.
Tom will turn thirty in October.
I wish I were a millionaire.
It is useless to talk to him.
Tom ran back across the street.
We adjourned the meeting until the following Friday.
My brother is a freshman.
Tom didn't want it.
We don't want to start any rumors.
It has begun.
What will we be doing this time next week?
When was the last time you angered your mother?
They are Christians.
I heard a shout and then a crash.
Tom stood in line.
The root of the problem is a lack of communication between departments.
Tom's alone.
Did you say 30?
Take the children inside.
Tom looked at what was on the computer screen.
You won't regret this.
May I ask why?
It is he who is to blame.
I foam at the mouth whenever someone mentions his name.
He always speaks of the government with contempt.
Tom doesn't swim so much anymore.
Tom is looking for a better job.
My grandmother knit that by hand.
Tom was ruined.
I can't lie to you.
I'm here with my family.
You must clean your room.
I want you to remember this moment.
I used to swim a lot.
I'd like to talk to Tom alone.
Don't remind me.
My hotel told me to call you.
Tom watched Mary throwing rocks into the water.
"Which do you like better, rock music or classical music?"
It is necessary for you to help her.
I will help you.
Tom began praying.
All Tom can think about is Mary.
Tom did it for the sake of his country.
He became world famous.
He often walks with his hand in his pocket.
How does this camera work?
Cut the meat into thin strips.
He suggested to her that she should buy it.
They wanted Hawaii to be part of the United States.
Eat and drink.
You're not trying hard enough.
Tom wants to get married.
What happened to Tom?
Tom even likes cold pizza.
I was too small.
Tom has already finished his lunch.
Tom seems to have a lot of fun trying to cause as much trouble as he can.
I know your brother very well.
That was a pretty stupid thing to do.
I live in the house.
She wanted him to take care of her parents.
We went to the same church.
I can't believe Tom went out with Mary.
What do you think of these shoes?
Do you know what these are?
She is not to blame.
You are under arrest.
Who listens to Tom?
What a beautiful sunset!
I didn't know Tom.
Tom paid back the money he owed me.
These shoes don't fit my feet.
It's terribly expensive.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary talks to his kids.
What impression do you have of China?
She treated him like a king.
They were unimpressed.
She walked arm in arm with her father.
I always list what I need before I go shopping.
Where can I get in touch with you?
The accident seemed to have something to do with the heavy snow.
Tom asked if I wanted to go to a party and I said yes.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom needs money.
I sent a message to Tom.
I'm happy to be able to help you.
That's good to know.
Didn't you tell me yesterday that you wouldn't be late today?
All I want to do is close my eyes and get some sleep.
It was this boy that broke the windowpane.
You could drive home by yourself.
I'll never forgive myself.
He is incompetent.
Don't you want to help?
She has recently made remarkable progress in English.
Tom's alive.
Guess who I saw last week.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
Has Tom arrived yet?
Why don't we take him a bottle of wine?
Did you take part in the discussion yesterday?
I showed Tom how to tie a bowline.
His dream came true.
I like walking at night.
Sign this.
Will you go to Tom's wedding?
It's not your money that I want.
"In my opinion, a well-designed website shouldn't require horizontal scrolling."
"Not knowing what to do, I telephoned the police."
You sound like your mother.
You can only use it once.
She threatened to set our house on fire.
He's my best friend. It's like we are brothers.
Tom locked himself in the bathroom and started to cry.
I consider you one of my closest friends.
I love going to Boston.
I'm so happy you're here.
She has a small house.
Did Tom say he loved you?
Did you find a job?
I'll shut the door.
Please write to me once in a while.
I don't eat much.
Tom is not always busy.
My goal in life is to be a novelist.
She has lost weight.
I am ashamed of my son's laziness.
Don't keep me waiting here like this.
Is that all you want to say?
Mary wore a red scarf around her neck.
Did you have fun in Boston?
This knife is very sharp.
What's Tom doing in there?
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it's warmer.
Bird watching is a nice hobby.
"If he knew the truth, he would tell us."
Where's the nearest bus stop?
He got lost on his way to the village.
I hesitate to pay so much for a suit.
"You can do whatever you want to, of course."
Taste this.
What reason could Tom possibly have to lie to you?
Are you sure we can't repair this camera?
"When we made fun of her, she blushed."
He hurried to catch the train.
I don't want to scare you.
It looks like you're on your own.
Tom can't help you now.
Who's responsible for this?
Even an expert driver can make a mistake.
Let me know when you need me again.
Tom threatened to kill me.
We were all shocked.
You need some more practice.
I decided to tell him that I love her.
He told everyone.
I didn't have to study yesterday.
"Mom, could you read me a bedtime story?"
Is there something in the fridge we can drink?
My left foot is asleep.
Did Tom come here?
When did she get married?
Tom doesn't like you very much.
What impression do you have of China?
"Correct the errors, if there are any."
I think times are changing.
I don't know exactly when Tom plans to get here.
Tom wants revenge.
Are you involved in this?
Go and talk to Tom.
He has some money in the bank.
I can't do that.
The value of his discovery was not realized until after his death.
I don't want to read anything.
This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
What did you want to show me?
May I go first?
Ready! Get set! Go!
It was freezing!
Tom stood up and headed for the door.
He does nothing but read books all day long.
Here are their books.
Do you really think Tom would forget something like that?
"If I had the money, I would make a trip around the world."
Tom hid under the bed.
I wouldn't care if Tom did that.
There is a shuttle bus that goes to the Ginza Tokyu Hotel.
You're charming.
Mary is beautiful.
I called him up.
I think it's Tom.
This building looks very futuristic.
We must always consider the feelings of others.
What's your plan for the day?
He began singing.
Tom is going be OK.
Can I talk to you in private for a minute?
I haven't got the foggiest notion what you're talking about.
Tom gave us nothing.
She is at most 18 years old.
This makes me think of you.
Will you light the fire?
I'm a truck driver.
We need to get to the airport.
Never trust anybody.
Tell her that I am taking a bath.
Don't leave the room.
Stop being so naive.
Stop that!
What is the area of this city?
He's not married.
I'm well.
Let's wait a while.
"Mary has no musical skill, but she loves to sing."
I saw you looking.
He can come.
Brace yourself.
"That's my CD, isn't it?"
You don't have to help.
I know what you're thinking.
I think she's innocent.
When was the last time you had your hair cut?
I can teach you something.
She wasn't polite to him.
I don't know whether you like her or not.
Tom seemed bossy.
You're a prisoner.
Use the manual override.
He made a joke about it.
It's a lovely day.
I gave Tom a book.
"If anyone can do it, it's you."
Tom is rich enough to buy whatever he wants.
How do you view this matter?
I remember everything.
They both got here late.
Few people live to be a hundred years old.
It sounds like you want to be alone.
We both have the same problem.
I am not what I was ten years ago.
Tom doesn't obey his parents.
He doesn't live here anymore.
They're towing your car.
This is your dog.
Tom is beginning to look pretty old.
I'll only be staying a few days.
He never saw his sister again.
I don't like what you said about Tom.
This is going to be fine.
The teacher was very angry.
I know that it is highly unlikely that we'll see any whales today.
Do you think we'll reach his house before noon?
I wouldn't sell that at any price.
Nothing can stop it.
Why did you say yes if you didn't want to go?
Do you know of any good restaurant near here?
You have no cause for anger.
I was trying not to look at Tom.
Do you have one that's cheaper?
Tom always complains about the way I do things.
"Pass me the salt, please."
I am laughing at you.
I might as well get a head start.
How old is your daughter?
Tom is a bodybuilder.
My parents are both dead.
Wood is flammable.
"If students today had more free time, they might show more interest in politics."
I happen to know a lot more about this than you do.
He did it just for fun.
I wish I had a room of my own.
Don't worry about the baby.
Tom has asked Mary to meet him at his office tomorrow.
He doesn't know any of us.
Tom is banned from entering this building.
Tom seemed to have lost his key.
We presented a watch to him.
I'd like you to look at something.
Please write down my address.
We're not going with you.
Which one do you think she chose?
The milk tasted sour.
Tom is taking a few days off.
Where is the gate?
Life's unfair.
I'm tired of working a nine-to-five job.
He died of lung cancer.
Tom will cook.
Are they Japanese?
You'd better not do anything like that again.
We were playing on the beach.
I probably would've done the same thing.
I don't get the connection.
You need a vacation.
Is Tom successful?
Are there any volunteers?
Are you sure about the cost of that car?
When shall we leave for the party?
This packaging is hard to remove.
Who called the police?
If only he would marry me!
My father loves to play the guitar.
You're driving too fast.
It is said that Japanese people don't celebrate Christmas the way Americans do.
I'm starting to wonder if this was a good idea.
She sent me an urgent telegram.
A noun can be singular or plural.
You know your rights.
Tom jumped into the swimming pool.
He has grown three centimeters this year.
That guy is an outlaw.
What were we talking about?
I've been trying to get your attention.
Be realistic!
I didn't ask you to wait for me.
Keep the secret to yourself.
Tom said he didn't enjoy watching baseball.
The minister appointed one of his cronies to a key position.
That won't happen.
"Even if it rains, I'll go swimming tomorrow."
Is it near here?
Tom pedaled his bicycle as fast as he could.
Can you feel the difference?
How beautiful she is!
I'm with the FBI.
"Of course, I remember Tom."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you."
I'm not ashamed of who I am.
"If you want to change your mind, I'd understand."
You're replaceable.
I want to see you laugh.
We only use our basement for storage.
The brakes didn't work.
I'd like to have a test for breast cancer.
The boy who's swimming over there with Mary is my younger brother.
I'd like to have this fabric dyed.
Paper production remained a state secret for a long time.
I'm very worried about Tom.
I really do want to get to know you better.
I scored only 33 points on the test.
I'm not going to do this.
You may come if you like.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal something like that.
Did you clean your room?
Tom made a complete fool of himself.
How far is it to the station?
I've been to Italy on a study abroad program.
Treat others how you want to be treated.
"Hey, you're early."
Everyone fell asleep.
The man was branded as a traitor.
You must be joking!
He is eighteen months old.
You made it possible.
Learn to walk before you run.
You've changed.
I'd like a little bit of cake.
I can't do it.
Tom wrote this report by himself.
Do you want Tom to know about it?
He likes playing football.
We wish you a pleasant flight.
She was happy that she passed the exam.
There's a fine line between genius and insanity.
I don't blame Tom for his decision.
You're a wonderful friend.
"You shouldn't use the word ""gay"" as an insult."
Don't bother to come to my house.
"Buy it for me, please."
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Would you look after my children while I am away on vacation?
I heard that he passed the exam.
They question your ability to lead.
"I had about a minute until the train left, so I didn't have time to explain why I was leaving."
I'd feel a lot better if Tom could stay with you.
We should definitely meet again soon.
Please tell Tom that I called.
How about tomorrow?
Mary is an oncologist.
He is not as young as he looks.
The speech deeply affected the audience.
I saw him first.
Everybody sang at the top of their lungs.
Your reputation is good.
My brother is a freshman.
I think that they were all fired.
He's not my father.
I felt the earthquake.
He pulled a coin out of his pocket.
Please don't make me help Tom.
The reports were confusing.
I suspect he is ill.
I am washing the windows.
He speaks English like a native.
This amount includes tax.
Why did you want to talk to Tom?
The car crashed into the truck.
The cat slowly approached the mouse.
This is the very book that I wanted to read.
This scene delights me.
What does this have to do with my family?
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
This hat is too small for me.
I will do everything in my power.
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
She advises him on how to stay healthy.
"If Tom were here, I wouldn't have to feed the dog."
Tom looked up from his book.
Is your family doing OK?
I should've been asked first.
Everything went as planned.
Tom says he can't ignore the noise any longer.
Tom sounds nice.
The world is worried about the nuclear capabilities of Iran and North Korea.
I'm in the tennis club.
This place is dangerous.
Can your wife speak French?
The answer is no.
There are more important things in life.
Can you give me a better price?
I am yawning because I feel sleepy.
They love that.
Get in here!
Tom is a great fighter.
"After it rains and the ground is damp, it's easier to pull weeds."
It looks delicious.
I think I've figured out why Tom has never learned to speak French so well.
"If anything happens here, can I depend on you?"
Neither of those two students passed the test.
We're expecting a good harvest this year.
Tom fell off a ladder and broke both of his arms.
Don't worry. The ambulance will be here soon.
Stop staring out the window.
I know where you want to be.
I'm not a marathon runner.
Why don't you ever help Tom?
Could you open the window?
What would you do if you were in my position?
Why are you acting this way?
You won't get rid of me that easily.
Tom played a song on the piano.
"Give that to me, please."
We need to keep moving.
I want something to eat.
I could stop you from doing that if I wanted to.
You'll have to do that again.
"Tom is a nice guy, except that he talks too much."
She is not aware of her beauty.
"These are for you, Tom."
I don't think Tom likes it.
Nobody is really sure.
"If you want to become a good writer, you need to practice writing."
Tom looks somewhat annoyed.
Tom pretended that it didn't matter to him that Mary was going out with John.
Please wrap it up.
That's why I told you that you shouldn't go alone.
Where did Tom get his hair cut?
Do you write in French?
He assumed the leadership of the political party.
How do you know I don't know?
May I use that?
Your CV has really impressed me.
"In poker, three of a kind and one pair is known as a full house."
Tom lives three blocks from the beach.
There are many Japanese restaurants in New York.
Tom accelerated.
"You can't say no to Tom, can you?"
I said get down!
This water is a little salty.
We had no choice.
Is there anything else I need to know?
I look after Tom.
I got up at seven in the morning.
Tom is putting on his shoes.
Nobody wants you to do this.
I know his name.
She patted me on the shoulder.
Do you believe in ghosts?
The vacation came to an end all too soon.
Don't play with me.
Tom and Mary decided to adopt John.
Didn't you hear a scream?

I would've liked to do that.
How did you become a police officer?
What are you sorry for?
Let's start the meeting now.
He disappeared without a trace.
Tom understands what Mary has in mind.
Are you sure of that?
What do your children usually eat for breakfast?
Are you telling me you don't know how to cook hard-boiled eggs?
Why does Mary cry so much?
The boy fell from the bridge.
Do you want me to wait?
How did you get down here?
Do you want me to come?
Why did he do such a thing?
Tom was shot with a poisoned arrow.
Hand me the remote.
I'm Tom's grandmother.
Many Americans like fast cars.
I was on my way to work.
The children exchanged presents at the Christmas party.
I knew Tom would do something stupid.
Tom said that he'd pay the bill.
You have taught him well.
Would you like to go to the movies with me?
"The more you explain it, the more I don't understand it."
That made a profound impression on me.
"If you wish, you can go."

He acted foolishly.
I can't believe I forgot.
Give me your phone.
Tom said I was the only one who said thank you.
This article is of no value.
The truck driver stopped at a rest area because he was tired.
I'll take this to Tom.
I want to tell you something.
I am short of money.
Please pass me the salt.
I'm a lot heavier than you.
Tell me more about yourself.
Please correct the following sentence.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Whose tea is this?
Tom took Mary's empty glass from her hand and refilled it.
I'll take care of the dog while you are out.
We must keep up the family traditions.
It has cooled off.
I can't eat another bite.
I hope it rains tomorrow.
That explains everything.
Hello? Are you still there?
My name's not Tom. It's John.
It was sweet of you to do this for us.
I feel quite at ease among strangers.
I know that Tom is married.
He will never live up to his parent's expectations.
He is the tallest in his class.
The play lasts two and a half hours.
I'm taking Tom to Boston with me.
I finally found out what was wrong with my TV.
It cost me 50 dollars to have my watch fixed.
Where are the other guys?
We have to be tough sometimes.
Buses in the country don't usually come on time.
I see your house.

I don't want to talk about that right now.
I was in the house.
What's your favorite Disney movie?

He has a little money.
Tom almost got caught.
Do you feel guilty?
I cut my finger with a knife.
Tom followed in his father's footsteps and became a lawyer.
There is an urgent need for water.
Can you put up with the noise?
Tom said that he and Mary were planning to visit Australia next year.
She is not less beautiful than her sister.
This one's no good.
I'm surprised you came at all.
How late did you stay at the party last night?
Can I take a picture here?
What did you end up doing?

Copenhagen is a bike-friendly city.
My father's birthday falls on Sunday this year.
"I like my soup to be warm, not hot."
I'll decide.

The customers have been complaining a lot lately.
This bottle holds one liter.
This book could be useful to you.
I've lost it.
How deep is this well?
When will you bring back my umbrella?
I'm not Canadian.
You're in my seat.
I would do anything but that.
Take this medicine. You will feel better soon.
Are you ever going to tell me what happened that night?
It doesn't matter where he comes from.
"Mary is pretty, isn't she?"
We're back.
The matter is really pressing.
I'm over eighteen.
I know what Tom is thinking.
His father eats there twice a week.
Tom appeared busy.
I was dreaming.
Solve the problem.
All of your accusations are without foundation. She's innocent and we're going to prove it.
Why do people do such stupid things?
Can you give me your phone number?
"Did Tom have to do that, too?"
"The bus stopped, but nobody got off."
Tom switched his phone to manner mode before he walked into Mary's office.
I wish I could join you.
It would be a waste of time to ask Tom to help.
Tom is here.
Your bike is much newer than mine.
My children are hungry.
What's Tom going to do about this?
They're in love.
We've had some very cold winters.

You will never be alone.

Does anyone want some more pie?
I know what Tom is looking for.
I'm afraid I won't be able to have lunch with you today.
She's unfit for the job.
Tom scored twice.

Close your eyes and tell me what you hear.
Please call an ambulance.
I wasn't the one who killed Tom.

I know what to do.
Let's stop playing tennis.
That store sells newspapers and magazines.
Who responded?
We are looking forward to our uncle's visit.
They had fun with us.
What'll you do with it?
I didn't know Tom was fat.
I'm watching the Olympics.
I am older than him.
I love both Mary and Alice.
I think Tom has made a mistake.
Tom probably thought I was angry.
Are you single?
Tom said that he was very busy.
They'll go shopping.
Do you think Tom's telling the truth?
What kind of job are you looking for?

I told you before that you should ask your mother first.
Let's start without Tom.
What would I do without you?
Don't touch my camera.
Tom would like to make more money.
Yes. We should be very careful.
Here's my receipt.
Tom doesn't think you should do that.
You completely ignored me.
It's popular with women.
I bet all the boys want your phone number.
I offered him fifty pence and he accepted.
I really don't have anything else to say.
Do you know how that could've happened?
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
It couldn't have happened at a worse time.
Tom is up there waiting for you.
You don't have to respond.
I don't want to be the one who tells Tom that Mary died in an automobile accident.

I just saw a huge owl.
Have you been waited on?
Don't be fooled by her appearance.
We saw laborers blasting rocks.
We have a visitor right now. Would you mind waiting for a while?
He thought that it was like a bird cage.

I used to live close to Tom.
The doctor arrived in time to save her.
Tom only lived in Boston for a short time.
That's our train.
What's Tom still doing here?

That isn't fair.

Let me deal with him.
Even my mom knows.
Do you think I need to go?
This shirt is too small for me to wear.
Tell me what you think about my car.
She was wearing a new hat.
Please read this book.
I have been to the U.S. twice.
I think I can do it in my spare time.
I thought you hated me.
Tom has been here for three hours.

Do you remember when I saw you last?
Do you know why I'm here?
It's dirt-cheap.

No one knows where Tom has gone.

I feel lost without you.
He's a DJ.
I know Tom likes basketball.
Tom listens to the radio while eating breakfast.
It's very cold now.
What's wrong with yours?
I forgot Tom spoke French.

We're gardeners.
Do you have any plans for the summer vacation?
Tom is a carpenter.
We all thought that Tom had escaped.
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I don't know what Tom has to do.
I want to play tennis with you someday.

You're hiding something.
We have to figure out a way to make some money.
She was laughed at by her friends.
I like teaching little children.

America's Civil War lasted four years.
What was I wearing at that time? Do you remember?
I don't care who kisses Tom.
We'll never forget your kindness.
Do you have any Japanese newspapers?
This will do nicely.
I could hardly tell who was who.
No one loves war.
Will you look after my dog while I'm out?
Tom disobeyed me.
Tom asked the waiter for another cup of coffee.
I am going to America by plane.

Take precautions.

You were right about everything.
Tom knows better.
I can't wait for school to start.
"Just between you and me, he is a liar."
I need to learn French.
He said that you had better go.
We accept credit cards.
Have you talked to Tom about this?
We need to know everything that you know about the situation.
I want to know where you heard that.
Tom stayed calm.
Where's the closest bus stop?
Tom introduced himself.
"If I were you, I'd talk to Tom."
What are the terms of the contract?
Mary is going to have a baby next month.
This hospital has a lot of new equipment.
We have many things in common.
This is the same type of car as my father has.
Can I call you back in twenty minutes?
I'm tired of reading.
Tell me how long that boy has been sitting there.
Please wrap it up.
We still need more time.
He likes to dress up as a police officer.
It sounds like you're having fun.
Do you want me to go?
"I wish I could tell you the reason, but I can't."
Tom's career is over.
How's the job hunt going?
I don't like him either.
"In order to do that, you have to take risks."
Look at the mountains covered with snow.

That happens all the time.

The surgeon removed the wrong organ.
That book's done a lot to popularize chemistry.
He doesn't earn enough money to live on.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom played the piano and Mary sang.
Stop pulling my hair.
It would be a good idea to try doing that.
I still haven't found work.
This is an ancient Chinese custom.
I didn't need your help.
I pulled a muscle.
I am not concerned with this.
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to take vitamins.
You make me feel safe.
His clothes are always out of style.
Do you have a timetable?
Is that a yes or no?
Did you enjoy the film?
Tom doesn't look good.
"Is he speaking English, French, or German?"
He used to love her.
I have a boyfriend back home.
Tom and Mary teach at the same school.
This is immoral.
Tom helped an old lady load her groceries in her car.
I won't go.
Tom said that he didn't know that Mary was going to eventually leave him.
They arrived just in time for the last train.
He got a bad reputation.
They'll do it.
We'll tell Tom.
Tom made Mary swim.
How wide is it?
Father is busy putting up a wall.
I feel like Tom is using me.
Tom is the guilty one.
They're going to Boston.
That has nothing to do with me.
This one's OK.
I've heard all this before.
Nobody volunteered.
Your secret's safe.
The accomplishment of this task took many years.
Tom began to cry.
He was accompanied by his girlfriend.
Tom lied to Mary when he said he didn't know John.
I never meant to put you in any danger.
He asked me a question.
Tom had the only pool in town with a diving board.
"Give me a hand, will you?"
"If you could do it, would you do it?"
Could you lend me your bicycle for a couple of days?
The girl was badly injured in the traffic accident.
Tom went back outside.
When did you last hear from Tom?
Tom's an extremely honest person.
His ideas are too extreme for me.
It was the only way.
I didn't need to pay for the food.
This wine is extremely delicious.
Why is it that you're always late?
Did you visit the Tower of London?
She looked at a few dresses and picked the most expensive one.
You're really selfish.
Please give me something to kill the pain.
I might be your only friend.
Get me some water.
I'm coming with you.
When was the last time I visited you?
You need to get ready.
Is this your suitcase?
I'd like to be more than just friends.
Tom gave Mary a key to his apartment.
Don't worry. I'll stay with you.
Tom put a bag of shredded cheese into his shopping cart.
I forgot to pay the rent.
I'll never be late again.
He admitted his defeat.
He wouldn't give in.

Did you enjoy the view?

He knows how to come to Tokyo.
It's time to put the children to bed.

The short circuit blew a fuse.
I helped my father water the flowers.
Where can I get stamps?
I'm beginning to think you're right.
Tom dedicated his life to helping the poor.
Tom's sorry.
I really should have called.
The sky will soon clear up.
I'm glad you know the truth.
I never get invited to parties.
I told you before not to do that.
I would've loved to meet Tom.
She will be here before long.
Tom did what he wanted to do.
Please don't speak French here.
Tom doesn't seem to want to go with us.
We have to wait for him.
Tom sat down between Mary and her husband.
Where's your mom?
Tom's efforts have been rewarded.
Tom would love to see this.
I can't do without your advice.
"He says that he saw nothing. However, I don't believe what he says is the truth."
I'm very interested in classical literature.
I can't face Tom today.
They're brown.
"I feel cold. Would you shut the window, please?"
This box is filled with apples.
I can't carry this suitcase. It's too heavy.
I can't believe that you love me.
That's all she wrote.
This material never wears out.
Does your invitation still stand?
Tom used to be our handyman.
Most writers are sensitive to criticism.
Tom isn't in a very good mood.
Get out of here! All of you!
There was no response to my question.
Tom is trying to trick you.
Would you like to have another beer?
He doesn't want to wait for you.
That almost sounds too good to be true.
I have to check my mailbox.
"Right at that instant, the bus stopped."
I've already told Tom all about it.
Tom wants you to do it for him.
She spends as much money as she earns.
The sun is brighter than the moon.
Maybe Tom doesn't have children.
Your family should come before your career.
I had a little difficulty in getting a taxi.
I saw him at the station a few days ago.
I'll even buy you a new car if you want one.
I arrived home just as my parents were leaving.
"Hey, what're you listening to?"
What were Tom and Mary doing in Boston?
Stay in your room.
Tom usually walks to school with Mary.
Don't mind me.
There is a market in the town.
Is your father in the garden?
Tom is not here.
He applied for the position.
I've got a message for you.
"Hey, how's it going?"
We don't know where Tom is.
I ate an apple.
"At the end of the day, the right decision was made."
Nobody ever came to see me in the hospital.
Tom usually takes a bus to work.
It was not until he was forty that he began to study German.
Can I have your phone number?
I thought it was true.
She trusted you.
It kind of surprised me.
I'm waiting for the ferry.
I am a bit drunk.
"You understand that, don't you?"
Prices may change.
It's my only copy.
Are these your daughters?
I'm not your doll.
Tom is sitting at his desk.
What you say is more important than how you say it.
When was the last time you made your bed?
"You're not much of a talker, are you?"
Tom always worries about his daughter.
His house is by a river.
I know my daughter better than anybody else.
"Let it go, Tom."
He likes to read newspapers.
What time can you come?
You're not a child anymore.
She is well known both in Japan and in America.
Most of the students here go to school on bike.
He finished reading the book.

Tom looks tired.
Do you know what Tom's favorite food is?
They were standing in a row.
Did you poison Tom?
My father has gone to China.
I met him once when I was a student.
Tom is freaked.
Two girls were hanging on to Tom's arms.
I'm not hungry right now.
That'll do it.
Plumbers are well paid for their labor.
Tom couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him.
They have assigned me a small room.
Will that key unlock this drawer?
That's fair enough.
Put it back where you got it from.
He lost his temper and hit the boy.
I was on the train for twelve hours.

He spoke with a softness characteristic of southerners.
I'm usually on time.
I go to church once in a blue moon.
I think Tom said his last name is Jackson.
Tom is a great presenter.
We're very happy with the results.
She displayed her talents.

Some countries make voting compulsory.
Tom fired his revolver at the man who had just killed Mary.
"As the room fall silent, only the ticking sound of an old clock could be heard."
"Excuse me, how much are these?"
Tom said that he was too busy to help Mary do that.
He knows how to pluck a chicken.
Tom really fooled Mary.
Yesterday I saw a girl whom I had met in the library a month before.
He finally achieved what he set out to do.
Won't you have another piece of cake?
There's something I need to tell you before you leave.
I'd like to know what you talked about.
"Strictly speaking, the earth is not round."
It's safe here.
I will do it myself.
The road was clear of traffic.
I feel strong.
My father's company is on the verge of bankruptcy.
Did you do that?
Tom was very drunk.
Is this your book?
I love French.
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
This book is worth reading.
The news of his death spread.
Tom kept pacing.
Boston is where I want to go.
They're gone.
The children made a giant snowman.
I thought Tom had a place to live.
You have dishonored the family.
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.
I can't go with you.
"This one's for you, Tom."
It took longer than I expected it to.
Let's schedule a meeting sometime early next week.
Tom came here to study French.
I thought you'd quit smoking.
I spend less money on clothes than my sister does.
I can run.
Lake Baikal in Russia is the deepest lake in the world.
I didn't speak with Tom.
Tom felt helpless.
He missed the train by a minute.
I like their pictures.
I knew it.
I will wait.
This was not supposed to happen.
He confessed that he had fallen in love with me.
"Christmas is soon, right?"
I can't help but wonder if Tom will be at school tomorrow.
Can I talk to someone who speaks French?
"Tom wanted me out of the house, so I left."
"Before leaving, his men set fire to the city."
She threatened to tell on me.
Stop it. You're being ridiculous.
May I take a rest?
May I ask you to call me back later?
What he said yesterday is not true.
Tom didn't see a way out.
The restaurant we went to wasn't as expensive as I expected it to be.
Tom wants to know what Mary did last weekend.
He was too angry to speak.
Be very careful with that blue box.
The telephone is essential to modern life.
I should tell Tom to try it.
You must allow for his youth.
You can park behind the hotel.
How did Tom persuade Mary to go to Boston with him?
The woman who he thought was his aunt was a stranger.
That was a very inconvenient time to bring up the subject.
You can't leave me now.
It's obvious Tom and Mary like each other.
Tom didn't let Mary play outside.
I was lucky.
"As far as the eye could see, nothing could be seen except cornfields."
Why did she remain in Germany?
Don't you want to stop Tom?
I'll keep the motor running.
"Who is the guy in the picture? ""I don't know who he is."""
My father won't allow me to do that.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
I bet five dollars that he will not come.
Tom's eyes were red from crying.
Did you drink a lot?
My mother used to read me stories when I was a young kid.
Take a deep breath.
Why would Tom want to go there?
I'd like to talk to you.
He drank a glass of red wine.

The child was exceptionally intelligent.
How do you like your new place?
Tom is starting to annoy me.
The police arrested a man who looks like Tom.
Don't you think it's still a little too early to talk to Tom about this?
I didn't need to do that.
What's in it for me?
Why do you have this?
Aren't you a Canadian?
Tom told Mary not to blame herself for what had happened.

Tom isn't going to get away with it this time.
Get out of there.
Is he looking at me?
I sure hope I don't catch anything.
Be vigilant.
You're wasting your time.
We lived from hand to mouth in those days.

The bus stop is near our school.
Would you be so kind as to open the door for me?
Why ask me? Wouldn't it be better to do it yourself?
I like the name Tom. It has a nice ring to it.
I'll take that risk.
How did you know all that?
Tom isn't here.
My grandmother was pulling up weeds in her backyard.
I'm listening to Björk's latest song.
Did you get something to eat?
No one has that right.

This is also my first time.

Do you like San Francisco?
She was run over by a car.
Are you sure that's how it's supposed to be done?
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
I recognized Tom at once by his voice.
I can't believe it's Christmas already.
She replied that she would be happy to come.
She's a good liar.
Do you have a history of ear infections?
I didn't expect to see you at a place like this.
Tom plans to throw away his old toaster.
I had a hard time trying to talk him out of taking the trip.
"The new concert hall is a tall, modern, structure."
"I don't know what else Tom told you, but I do know he doesn't always tell the truth."

I'm not your son.
I'll show you how to do it.
I want a martini.
Romania is a Balkan country. Its capital is Bucharest.

I like salmon.
"Tom doesn't look so busy, does he?"
This question is not easy.
Where's Tom going to live?
I have already finished this book.
I do not allow sleeping in class.
The lights are out.
He was no longer dependent on his parents.
I have the right to say what I think.

That problem has been shelved for the time being.

This tank has a capacity of thirty liters.

It's not the same without you.
I could've met you at the airport.
Tom has a skeleton key.
We'll watch you.
Tom seemed to be very content.
Where are you going to live?
Nothing can be done.
Nobody understands you.
He's about the same age as you are.
We regret doing that.
"Tom is good at French, but he's a lot better at English."
Tom guessed how much Mary weighed.
You should give up smoking.
Tom tries.
He kissed her hand.

Live and let live.
I don't want Tom to go to Boston.
Do you think he made that mistake on purpose?
Tom didn't come until 2:30.
"If you eat too much, you'll become fat."
What if someone finds out?
He became a Catholic.
I thought you came to see Tom.
They quickly became close friends.
You promised me you'd look after Tom.
We're not so confident.
We know each other pretty well.
Leaves are to plants what lungs are to animals.
I know it very well.
I shuffled the cards and then dealt them.
I'm sure this will happen again.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate all your help.
Is this the reason you didn't want to come with me?

Tom's up.
I think Tom is too young to be dating.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
What's in that bottle?
Let Tom decide.
Do you know what they said?
We have no choice but to compromise.
She likes that bass.
I'm coming to get you.
It may snow in the afternoon.
Will you come and see me?

What are you afraid of?
Do you have any good news?
Tom thanked Mary again.
Tom entered Mary's office after knocking.
Get lost!
Japan was one of the world's fastest growing economies in the 1980s.

I told Tom that I was tired.
My garden is small.
I want to learn about American daily life.

Cattle feed on grass.
Tom helped with the dishes.
A convict has escaped from prison.
Tom showed no consideration whatsoever for Mary's feelings.
We're not at war with Japan.

Tom was eating.
There is nothing on earth that is not affected by the sun.
He can't stop laughing.
Tom knows French.
This is a four-way stop.

I bet you're right.
Tom went pale.
Might I ask your name and address?
You don't look too good.
We're illiterate.
Tom walks his dog every morning.
Do I really remind you of Tom?
We often played chess after school.
You could help me.
I admire Tom a lot.
"As far as I know, Tom is happy."
I came looking for you.
Tom was fortunate.
Tom is always like that.
The telephone is a means of communication.
You are not to blame for the accident.
I have two children.
It was difficult for me to make out what he was saying.
The understanding of the present is impossible without a good understanding of the past.
I'm willing to take that risk.
The new building is enormous.
I'll teach you a lesson that you won't forget.
It wasn't expensive.
He likes to cook for his family.
Tom won't die.
I'll drink to that.
"Tom can speak French, too."
Don't you think that's a bit strange?
I want you to keep your promise.
I have gained weight.
Tom and Mary used to be inseparable.
Tom solved the puzzle after Mary gave him a few hints.
What language do they speak in the United States?
That's the best way of settling it.
I would like to buy a sofa.
Tom and Mary were too tired to fight.
Tom likes that one.
Are you honest?
I miss my old job.
Come on. Let's go home.
Finally we arrived at the lake.
Tom can't do this to us.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary about something.
This shirt is too small for me to wear.
What're you good at?
I will study abroad when I have finished school.
This isn't funny.
I'm cleaning my room.
I only heard about it myself a couple of minutes ago.
You should've said so earlier.
Do you know this part of the city very well?
What's your favorite salty snack?
He wants to come with us.
Tom believes in equality between women and men.
Do you know who said that?
His lecture started on time.
I can do it by myself!
Is your school far away from your house?
"When he comes in, give him this book."
I've loved you since the day I first saw you.
This is all the money that I have now.
You can't learn a foreign language in just a couple of weeks.
Tom laughed at himself.
I major in economics.
It's not an impossible request.
I can see that you are working.
She may be waiting at the station now.
I learned my lesson.
You don't have any proof.
"The other day, I met him in Kyoto."
She was anxious to know the entrance exam results.
Do you have a best friend?
Where was he going?
Don't you have anything better to do with your time?
I wrote my name on the paper.
Could you tell me how to get to the station?
I think you should get more rest.
You were right to worry.
This stain won't come out.
Where's it from?
I haven't gotten over my bad cold yet.
We made it.
I am married and I have two sons.
Your book is on the desk.
I can't remember what this is called.
You've got to stay awake.
You have an e-mail message in your inbox.
Why didn't you come?
We went shopping with our friends.
Beware of the dog!
This ice is going to crack.
Put your books away.
Tom bought a bunch of inexpensive cameras to give to children who lived in his neighborhood.
Life is short.
You have dirt under your fingernails.
It could be a coincidence.
What's it worth?
Everything's changed.
Tom slowly walked up the stairs.
I need to sleep now.
I attempted to solve the problem.
She was asked to help him paint the house.
The governor set the prisoners free.
I'll tell you right now that Tom won't know the answer.
I think Tom might finally have a good idea.
I'll fix you a cup of tea.
Tom said that he decided it was too hard to do.
I don't understand it.
I'll miss you.
I see what the problem is.

That's the reason he became angry.
Are you sure this is Tom's?
Don't dwell on your past failures.
I like sweets.
I wish you wouldn't drive so fast. You're making the baby sick!
I thought you said Tom was overweight.
May I put it down here?

Have you eaten supper yet?
What month is this?
You should've come to the party.
This miso soup is too hot to drink.

"She wore a long, loose coat."
Tom isn't in a joking mood.
"When he retired, his son took over his business."
Do you really think that Tom had nothing to do with what happened?
Where could he be?
Who asked Tom to do that?

I am going to apply for a visa today.
Don't look down on the poor.

You have beautiful lips.
Tom didn't know where Mary came from.
Do you really think you can learn to speak French fluently in three months?

How is it that you're always so full of energy?
Go away.
This rose is beautiful.
They have gone to Europe.
He took out a dollar from his wallet.
Do not say such foolish things.
You should have refused such an unfair proposal.

You hit the center of the target.
You're not making sense.
What's happening here?

I already told you why.
I've got to see you.
They aren't coming today.
Tom saw him.

Do you know what you're doing?
They're not my enemies.

He does nothing but complain from morning till night.
How do you know about this?
How about a cup of hot coffee?
Tom was scared.
Tom takes a shower every morning before breakfast.
I signed the contract.
Do you want me to come back?
How big is your house?
Tom lives life to the fullest.
The fact that I'm here proves that I'm innocent.
I'm tired. I just want to go on the teacup ride and take it easy.
"Tom and Mary walked into the restaurant and looked around, but couldn't see a free table."

I know where you can hide.
I'll show you the car I've just bought.
What did they say to you?
"Tom and Mary know each other, but they're not exactly friends."
Summer has ended.
I have a girlfriend.
Are you joking?
Some would say that he's playing with fire.
It cost me a thousand yen to get my bicycle fixed.
I doubt very much Tom will be interested.

My decision is final.
I am accountable to him for the loss.
Tom is the lead engineer.

He was happy being a Jew.
Tom asked for a raise.
I'm afraid you'll have to learn to live with the pain.
I object to my son studying abroad.
Something funny is always happening in our class.
Just leave me alone.
Do you have two computers?

Don't neglect your daily responsibilities.
This is not how I wanted this to end.
Just how big an idiot do you think I am?
"If something goes wrong, you should take care of it at once."
Perhaps you're trying too hard.
Be more flexible.
I don't watch that program anymore.
It was his fault.
I used a computer in order to save time.
He sent the letter back unopened.
The contract expires next year.
That's another matter.

Save room for dessert.
I have not had a chance to see that movie.
"If you keep on like this, you'll probably live to reach 120!"
He agreed to give us an interview.
They were all sold out.
There's no toilet paper.
A child is spoiled by too much attention.
Tom made me say those things.
I'll give you this.
Which one is more expensive?
It would be inappropriate to discuss that now.
I never learned his real name.
It was already dark when Tom got home.
Do you feel up to it?
Tom came to see me.
The road was obstructed by fallen trees.
I like this book.
When was the last time you bought shoes?
She plays the piano every day.
Are you dead?
Could you help me out here?
The answer to both questions is no.

We have five English lessons a week.
I have a lot of pencils.
I ate some spinach.
I don't much feel like working these days.
Tom wants to know when we're going to leave.
Tom said he was busy.
The ice will crack under your weight.
"Every time she coughed, she felt a great deal of pain."
I feel very lonely these days.
I thought you cared about Tom.
It is getting dark outside.
Would you please turn the TV off?
Did you tell Tom about Mary?
Her speech bored me.
Here's the book you wanted to read.
"If you don't want this, I'll give it to someone else."
Typhus is a contagious disease.
The sudden increase of cars is causing a large number of traffic accidents every day.
I'd never do that to you.

Thank you for the wonderful gift.

Let's get married.

What time do you have a break?
He ran into the classroom.
Tom is in the shower.
How long will that last?
Don't talk about yourself like that.
Tom missed the last train and had to take a taxi home.
I'll talk.
What else do you need?
Tom was really mad.
It'll cost over a thousand yen.
He ripped his shirt open.
We don't know what Tom said.

Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
There has got to be an explanation.
I'm being charged with murder.
We found him alive.
Do you like surfing?
It runs in the family.
I'm not sure if this is correct.
My throat hurts when I swallow.
Tom left the house.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to ride his horse.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
That's not what this is about.
Tom must've won.
Tom is in a good mood today.
Can I make a suggestion?
I just don't know what to say.
My wife is obsessed with cleaning.
Tom doesn't know how to have fun.
Tom seems anxious.
I don't think we have enough time.
I am convinced of his honesty.
I'm almost finished here.

Please fetch me a piece of paper.
I hate the cold.
Tom told the doctor he'd fainted three times last week.
I have nothing in common with him.
There is heavy traffic on this road.

Don't you think it's a good idea?
Tom has been to Boston only once.
"If you think you're someone, you stop becoming someone."
I asked Tom why he wasn't here yesterday.

Many admire him.
Tom and I want you to come.
The dog was hit by a car.
She has a big family.
I finally found a place where we can be alone.
She made a good speech.
It is difficult to say which vehicle is more beautiful.
"In my opinion, alcohol is not necessarily bad for your health."
What's your wife's name?
Tom doesn't know what you've done.
"Excuse me, may I come in?"
Could you tell me something about yourself?
Here's what I don't get.
That seat is taken.
She married an American GI after the war.
I'm going to grow wheat there.
Food shouldn't be wasted.
What could be the meaning of it?
This booklet is free of charge.
Only six people came to the party.
My parents were proud of me.

A dash of vinegar is all the salad needs.
I am dozing.
I was very ill at ease with those people.
I don't know what to tell you.

I don't want Tom to die.
"Tom, can you hear me?"
Your colorful shirt really stands out.
How did you come to know this?

"According to the weather report, it will snow tonight."
They are both very competent judges.
"You don't even know who I am, do you?"
Many paintings hang in the shop.
He cheated on the test by copying his friend's answers.
It was extremely funny.
I have seen nobody apart from you.
Don't hide under the bed.

I'm coming for you.
Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.
I'm afraid he is ill.
I wonder why my computer crashed.
Mary got mad at me.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I don't have as much money as you think.
Don't drink the water.
Tom kept me waiting for three hours.

I stand corrected.
May I go out to play when I have read this book?
Goodbye till tomorrow.

That's the only appliance that I have.
I wasn't going to mention it.
You may bring whoever you like.
I saw the boy in brown shoes.
My daugther wants a kitten.
Speak up. I can't hear you.
"If Tom had seen anything, he would have told us."
That's only a temporary solution.
There's a lady asking for you.
I want to do everything I can to make sure Tom is able to go to college.
I don't think you want that.
I wish you the best of luck.
She has changed greatly since I last saw her.
Tom doesn't study hard enough.
He has been gaining weight.
You're making a big fuss about nothing.
He taught me how to write.
I continued singing.
Tom adjusted the mirrors.
Tom bought the same camera that Mary has.
We'd love to have Tom back.
Nothing is as hard as a diamond.
I have a rough idea where it is.
I always travel with travelers' checks instead of cash.
"When I saw the ghost, I was so frightened that my hair stood on end."
We'll see how it goes.
I felt like screaming.
You have better taste than I thought.
That'll never change.
Could you tell me how to call this number?
Can you tell me which button to press?
That meat is chicken.
I watched TV this morning.
"You don't even know who I am, do you?"
I'm at home almost every night.
Tom knows a lot about wild animals in this area.
He is a dramatist.
Did Tom really dance?
One who has everything can lose everything.
I'm probably not the only one here who can't do that.
Time flies like an arrow.
It'll snow today.
How many cups of coffee did you drink today?
Tom applied for a visa.
What language do you two use to communicate?
Could you speak a little louder please?
The people are angry.
He raised his hand to stop a taxi.
I heard the door open.
I had no choice but to stay.
You should plan to leave between 6:00 and 7:00.
Which horse did you bet on?
Maybe Tom was right.
Don't you trust Tom yet?
Tom is like that.
Do not give in to those demands.
The weather outlook for tomorrow is not good.
I attend a public school.
I wish you'd stop calling me Tom.
The prince asked the little girl why she was crying.
I have no money.
Do you think I don't know?
I've been waiting like a year for this.
Tom always wins.
She drank two glasses of wine at the party.
I didn't like Tom's suggestion.
I have to do it again.
We have the same destiny.
Have you considered moving to Boston?
I don't want what I'm about to say to be recorded.
Why are you siding with him?
I'm pretty good at cooking spaghetti.
Tom is useless.
Tom certainly wouldn't be anywhere near as rich as he is if he hadn't married Mary.
You aren't wrong.
"Tom was well liked by his classmates, teachers and friends."
I heard you got married.
I'm coming to Boston.
Tom is a brave warrior.
Suddenly Tom began to cry.
It should only take a couple of minutes.
You've been spotted.
Take your time.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be hiding?
Can we count on you?
Colds are contagious.
I've lost a little weight.
It was bound to happen sooner or later.
Tom needs our help and I'm going to make sure he gets it.
Let them talk.
I was so happy back then.
Tom told me why he didn't want to go.
They slept in the same room.
That street is very noisy.
Tom accepted Mary's offer.
Did you like the movie?
Since we insulated the house we've saved a lot on heating oil.
My life would be very dull without books.
Is anyone absent today?
Haven't you ever heard of Rio de Janeiro?
He must have left the water running.
It happened in a flash.
What're you going to do with that?
Are these all the sizes you have?
I will personally be responsible for it.
Don't run here.
Tom is sitting at one of the tables back there.
They ran past Tom.
Have you already eaten breakfast?
I sent you a letter.
She is bustling about in the kitchen.
Tom grows rice.
I think I remember you.
Tom swims very well.
What is your earliest memory from childhood?
I don't think it's funny.
We came back by way of Hong Kong.
There aren't any problems.
Where is my dog?
They left before the end of the movie.
The office seems very busy today.
That isn't French.
I can't see anything without my glasses.
I hope you'll reconsider.
They are not sisters.
I was feeling blue all day.
Tom has a lot of work to do.
I'm an extremely humble person.
Tom disappointed Mary.
I don't like this hat.
It has to be me.
May I use the vacuum cleaner?
Tom needed something to do to keep his mind off his problems.
See you in October.
She was naive.
Let's get started.
We don't like you.
Tom and Mary used to be sweethearts.
I went to the hospital to visit him.
Tom'll be ready.
I'm going to Australia in the fall.
Everyone noticed.
Tom didn't call Mary from Boston.
I'm used to people not agreeing with me.
Come forward.
He was drunk on beer.
Try to guess.
Tom has a thing for you.
"My sister isn't a good cook, and neither am I."
I like to catch flies.
I didn't kill anyone.
Tom seemed better.
Get on your knees.
He interrupted the speaker with frequent questions.
Tom is now in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound.
In the wagon were a few tools and some extra guns.
Tom was listening with his eyes half closed.
Tom held on to the rope.
"When I'm with you, I'm happy."
Tom is younger than you think.
Contact your local police if you have any information on Tom Jackson's whereabouts.
We're OK.
Did you clean your room?
I don't like where this is going.
Tom forgot to sign his name.
It actually isn't that simple.
Tom asked Mary to leave the windows open.
I am pretty sure.
He began to sing.
You can't survive without money.
Cooking is interesting.
Chariot races were popular in ancient Rome.
There'll be no classes on October 20th.
You should make good use of your time.
I'm snowed under with work.
Mary is not my sister.
World war two broke out in 1939.
I want an apple.
That makes sense.
He can't make a decision.
"I want your opinion, too."
The train seems to be late.
Tom said he'd rather stay at a hotel near the airport.
Tom just stood there watching Mary staring at herself in the mirror.
It's a pity that you should leave Japan.
Tom is trying to get back into shape.
My desire is to help you with this problem.
It's 7:50 in the morning.
I wonder who Tom was talking to.
Tom's family is here.
You should have come to us.
I can't think of anything I'd want from you.
Tom is smarter than he looks.
The cat was not buried alive. He survived.
He was tied to the tree with a rope.
Tom didn't actually ever go on a date with Mary.
A beautiful woman like you shouldn't be eating alone.
Tom burst into tears and ran upstairs.
I could not make the train.
Tom may have misunderstood you.
Tom walked away.
He wears a bow tie every day.
He watched the boys swimming.
Why don't you just call Tom and tell him you can't do it?
Wouldn't you like to get some fresh air?
Do it anyway.
Tom's French is surprisingly good.
That all sounds reasonable.
I wish I had been with you then.
I have enough money to buy a car.
I'm finishing my homework.
I wouldn't want to die here.
I want what you want.
I know you want to talk to Tom.
Tom ate the delicious meal and thought he must be in heaven.
Most snakes on this island are harmless.
I trust you all.
He checked in at a good hotel.
I did it quickly.
The French like to eat frog legs.
These are great.
"We will start tomorrow, weather permitting."
I can't go into that.
There's a good chance Tom will pass today's exam.
I've explained all of this to you before.
Tom had almost forgotten all about what had happened.
We no longer need you.
You're witty.
You look stupid.
Tom is playing with his cat.
Tom's family rarely eat together.
They are reading her book.
Please think it over and let me know your decision.
Nobody can love him.
Are you up there?
"Give me something to write with. ""Will this do?"" ""Yes, it will do."""
That cannot have been true.
She can hardly speak Japanese.
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
"Strangely, he passed up her very generous offer."
I like milk.
"Some juice, please."
We just want you to be happy.
Tom was pleasantly surprised to see Mary.
You're not as stupid as you look.
It's far from over.
Give it to me.
Vote for me!
He runs a supermarket in the town.
Please buy a package of spaghetti noodles.
This morning it was very cold.
I just wanted to get Tom's attention.
Is that problematic for you?
Please keep this information to yourself.
Did everyone agree?
I think Tom doesn't like to ski.
Tom is alone in the living room.
Why are you pretending you don't remember?
I made a wrong turn.
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.
The conference takes place annually.
I've been living in this house since last month.
Which ones do you like better?
The air conditioner has got out of order.
Start reading where you left off.
He knows how to fish with a fishing rod.
Tom seemed quite surprised when he heard that Mary and John had gotten married.
I have been reflecting on what you said to me.
He promised not to say it.
Can you recommend a hotel near the airport?
Could you survive alone in the wilderness?
This is our friend Tom.
The light came on suddenly.
We are happy to see you.
Everything was ready for the trip.
Do you understand what he's saying?
Tom has some advice for us.
I took the bus back.
Tom isn't sane.
Tom patted himself on the back.
Who're you looking for?
I can solve this problem.
Tom didn't have a problem with that.
We would like to buy a sofa.
I hope you're not planning on wearing that to the party.
Is that so bad?
This dress looks good on you.
Tom collects antiques.
He was married to her sister.
You're an excellent liar.
The tree fell over in the typhoon.
I think it's unlikely that plants feel pain.
Tom smiled at the audience and took a bow.
It's the voice of an old woman.
You should've stood up.
I have a friend who works for NASA.
Can you decipher the message?
Tom got in the car.
Tom was asked not to do that again.
Is the coffee strong enough?
Where is the Swedish embassy?
She has a daughter who is a pianist.
This book is easy enough for me to read.
Why don't you ask Tom?
We both know that.
I thought Tom was guilty.
Hey. Where are you going?
This might not be enough.
She plays the piano very well.
He became interested in mathematics.
Have you heard whether Tom got the job?
Please stop crying.
Come over here and join us.
How did you come by all this money?
Are you here?
What do you want to do with it?
I heard someone call my name.
We're engaged.
Please pass me the salt and pepper.
His soul was in heaven.
Everybody stayed.
I want to thank you for that.
Tom isn't going to stop Mary.
Don't ask me why.
Everyone waited.
"Finally, we reached the top of the mountain."
I prefer quality to quantity.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
You are mistaken as to what makes him so nervous.
I don't know that word.
Tom was drinking from a water bottle.
Don't pretend what you don't feel.
Have you been here since?
He's old enough to go to school.
Tom is almost always at home on Sundays.
Tom takes piano lessons once a week.
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
Tom couldn't restrain himself.
Tom doesn't like the way his mother cuts his hair.
He is very fond of music.
Mary is Tom's girlfriend.
He became irritated.
I'm not used to speaking in public.
"I can't talk you out of it, can I?"
Keep talking.
Tom rushed out onto the road without looking both ways.
"If he had been a little more careful, the accident would have been avoided."
Cut that out!
Stay there a little longer.
Progress is unavoidable.
Who else uses it?
It's a stupid law.
The incidence of OCD is greatest among teens and young adults.
Tom said you were hungry.
How long do you plan to stay in Boston?
I can't imagine such a life.
Best wishes from all of us.
Take whatever you want.
Are all the doors locked?
May I have one of these?
I made this for you.
The children took their ice skates and made for the frozen pond.
I can't believe Tom still uses it.
Did Tom say anything that might help us?
The skiing season has passed.
Tom is very reliable.
"Tom is in a meeting, but Mary's in her office."
Tom went to Boston to meet Mary.
Here's my phone number.
Tom is stranded.
What language do they speak in Egypt?
How young do you think Tom is?
Tom knows you're here.
It's up to you to do it.
I didn't see who was driving.
"When you know, let me know."
I think I know what you need.
You may stay here as long as you keep quiet.
Have you finished your preparations for the trip?
I'm glad you like my apartment.
I think you've done enough.
We'll scream.
Be careful on your way back home.
Tom doesn't want to go away.
Tom is horrified.
I overheard what you said.
The colors of this painting are very bright.
I thought you said you didn't know Tom.
I was born during the Showa era.
Tom got dressed quickly.
Tom loaded the truck.
Are you on Facebook?
That's interesting.
She reminds him of his mother.
Tom always thinks he's right.
You'll regret what you've done.
Milk is a popular beverage.
Let me know if you need my help.
She pretended to know nothing about it.
Where do you park?
I thought you said it wasn't contagious.
Why aren't you saying anything?
You're just a boy.
I cannot speak German.
I love you.
Tom decided to study law.
It's getting light. Morning is coming.
This fact must not be forgotten.
I thought you said Tom wasn't a member of our club.
You could pass for a teenager if you wore a T-shirt.
I like traveling by train.
I have something to tell you.
How did you vote on that matter?
You aren't yourself today.
I'll come at 2:30.
When is your flight?
Maybe we'll try again later.
She will return home to her family.
Please promise you'll never lie to me again.
Did you know this at the time?
Tom is going to miss Mary.
Go and wake Tom up.
I think I know what it is.
Tom wants to go to Japan.
I asked him not to drive so fast.
The result is all that matters.
Tom looks cold.
This check is payable to the bearer.
Tom struggled to keep up with his classmates.
Mary was wearing a sleeveless summer dress.
I have no time to read books.
Tom has a serious health problem.
I tried to absorb as much of local culture as possible.
He's open-minded.
Tom turned on the TV.
They are very proud of being students of that college.
Tom was wearing a leather jacket.
That's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it.
He gave up hope.
"Sister, don't let this patient out of your sight."
I have an older brother and an older sister.
What's Tom's dog's name?
"So, what do you find so interesting about dinosaurs?"
You never call me.
I'd be much obliged if you could give me a lift into town.
It's naive of you to believe that.
I'll need at least a day to make the necessary preparations.
I need you to do it yourself.
Let's look at the problem from a different point of view.
I like to get things done on time.
I only saw one person on the beach.
What happened between you and Tom?
Tom was wearing a faded blue work shirt.
Tom was convicted and sentenced to death.
"This figure is supposed to represent Marilyn Monroe, but I don't think it does her justice."
The castle is worth visiting.
I had to walk home.
I was thinking you might like to go camping with us this weekend.
"Mom, hurry up! Everyone's waiting."
He wears expensive clothes and owns a lot of jewelry.
"I'm disappointed in you, Tom."
It doesn't make economic sense.
"According to the paper, it will snow tomorrow."
All at once there was an explosion.
Give me five days.
"If you have something to say, say it to my face."
I just received a message that the meeting has been canceled.
Where's the nearest travel agency?
I have to get out of here.
His father calls him Tom.
You have only three minutes left.
We still have plenty of time.
Where's your home?
She has a soft and clear voice.
He doesn't want to work in a factory.
This movie is one of my all-time favorites.
This shoe is a size bigger.
Tom began to sing his favorite song and Mary harmonized with him.
I raised my hand to ask a question.
One of your brake lights is burned out.
The plants suffered damage from the frost.
We have to have this.
Soccer is more popular than tennis.
Look me up next time you are in Kyoto.
"Go straight, then turn right."
She couldn't think what to give the children for Christmas.
Tom looks bummed.
I'm giving it to you.
My room is on the fourth floor.
You're too good to me.
Introduce me to your friend over there.
Be sure to pick up some milk.
Did you bring a weapon?
Tom warned Mary about John.
Tom says he's the best tennis player at his club.
Why do you ask that?
Tom spoke highly of you.
I don't know who that man is.
Obedience is not enough.
Your father is tall.
Tom doesn't want us to come.
Tom may come here.
When was the last time you dyed your hair?
Which one do you like best?
I can't remember how to go there.
Tom said that he could make it to the party.
How old do you think she is?
This letter is too long to have it translated at a reasonable price.
Tom can't keep his mouth shut.
You'd better not do it.
Tom is in his room.
I'm often half asleep.
Did I embarrass you?
"Indeed you know a lot of things, but you're not good at teaching them."
Tom dropped Mary off at her friend's house.
"She said that she would come back again, which was a lie."
I want to understand Tom.
He scolded her.
I loved that.
"Would you leave us alone, please?"
Tom wouldn't approve.
Whose lyrics are these?
You look nervous.
We finally did it.
No one can deny the fact that fire burns.
He adhered to the original plan.
Goodbye and good luck.
Tom weighs more than Mary.
We both know you don't live where you say you do.
You can stay as long as you like.
I have to get moving.
He fell a victim to a deadly disease.
This bed is very comfortable.
The car hit a tree.
Tom sent you something.
I know that look.
Nobody seems interested in dancing with me.
She is listening to him.
Let's get moving.
No one was killed in the fire.
Change was in the air.
He had no difficulty swimming across the river.
What is your suggestion?
"Esperanto, Ido, Interlingua, Klingon, Lojban, Na'vi and Volapük are constructed languages."
I didn't really think about that.
Tom was secretly in love with Mary.
Flowers bloom.
"Do you know him, by any chance?"
I'll see you Monday.
It's just down the street on your left.
Tom poured some milk from the bottle into a bowl for his cat.
I arrived in London.
Carry out my orders!
Have you ever failed an exam?
Do you think it's going to rain tomorrow?
We're practically family.
That depends on whether you are interested or not.
We were disappointed to hear that she had married him.
I studied very hard.
Perhaps we can come to some arrangement that works for both of us.
I can't talk about this now.
I imagine that Tom will eventually find out that Mary has been talking behind his back.
We need to work as a team.
Is that a no?
I had a nightmare.
We're doing fine.
You don't scare me anymore.
My uncle went to Mexico in 1983 and never came back.
Can we talk to Tom?
I'm in love with her.
Tom wondered if he had enough money to pay the bill.
This CD belongs to her.
My computer suddenly stopped working.
We had a wonderful time today.
I'll be there all day.
"The notice in the park said, ""Keep off the grass."""
I'm Tom's nephew.
He studies much harder than before.
Tom left Mary in the room by herself.
She insisted that he should go to the hospital.
That's a horse of a different colour.
How did you find out that Tom hadn't paid his bills?
Tom leaned out the window of his car and pressed the button on the intercom at the gate.
The boys are fine.
He believes that there is a spy among us.
I didn't see anyone in the room but Tom.
Tom wasn't allowed to visit his father in prison.
You're winning.
Tom writes very well.
I like apples.
"When I got home, I realized I had lost my wallet."
He knows how to play poker.
He divorced his wife last month.
Tom and I live in the same neighborhood.
It is said that he is sick.
I'll be ready to go by 2:30.
Their son grew bigger.
Tom and Mary grow leaf lettuce in their garden.
We came to the conclusion that we should support the movement.
It's fun to speak in English.
Tom wanted revenge.
They were carried away by the police.
He believed that the earth was round.
Tom was glued to his TV during the World Cup final.
Should we call an ambulance?
You can use a dictionary for this exam.
I will give you permission to do it.
He's probably wrong.
Tom peeked in the window and saw Mary and John kissing.
I have a cousin who is a lawyer.
Tom put his wallet on the table.
There may be some truth in your story.
The doctor pronounced him dead.
"If I were you, I wouldn't worry."
Tom enjoys being the center of attention.
"Where is my book? ""It's in the classroom."""
Why is everyone acting like this is such a big deal?
Would you like to go for a walk?
I bought this book the other day.
She turned her eyes away.
Tom's only pretending to be drunk.
You can't go back there.
I don't want Tom to think he has to interpret for me.
You need therapy.
We're friends.
This custom is peculiar to Japan.
There was no real evidence against Tom.
The button came off.
There were two left.
What've you been doing recently?
Do you like this garden?
I couldn't agree more.
Do you have a Christmas vacation in Japan?
You'd make a good counselor.
What else do you have?
Where did you learn this?
She saved a hundred dollars.
I'm sick of her excuses.
I bought a house.
We are in Paris.
You look relieved.
Do you have a headache?
Tom sometimes sings in French.
She's much better today than yesterday.
"He gives plain, simple explanations."
What do these statistics mean?
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand."
Let them know we're busy.
I will give you anything you want.
Your jokes aren't funny.
What are you going to say to Tom?
Are there any beaches in Germany?
Thank you for your letter.
Would you mind not doing that?
I am afraid he won't come.
Cats have nine lives.
There's no hope.
That ended better than I expected.
She's rather good.
She often goes to the movies with him.
It's not rocket science.
Have you already decided what to do next Sunday?
How come you're late?
Tom was raised in a small village.
I didn't cheat.
Always keep your eyes on the road.
Does that make it clearer?
Why doesn't Tom want me to do that?
We can't go there.
I don't like your boss.
When exactly did you see Tom?
The man reading a paper over there is my uncle.
I can't figure out how to solve the puzzle.
I got it for Christmas.
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
I am greatly impressed.
She gave birth to a healthy baby.
I'm sure that your parents are very proud of you.
Tom should really wear safety glasses.
It takes many years of training to become an astronaut.
I don't have travel insurance.
When you start looking like your passport photo you should go on vacation.
He and I are brothers.
Have you ever seen a kangaroo?
Tom nearly laughed out loud.
Tom is my only brother.
Please translate this Japanese text into French.
The manager blamed himself for the failure.
I don't like Tom and I don't trust him.
Mary and Alice aren't sisters.
That's pretty obvious.
He gave up taking part in the marathon on account of his cold.
The food was delicious.
It's not going to be that easy.
It's a family trait.
You're in luck.
He misses his family.
This is the house where he was brought up.
I'll take care of the horses.
Those plans seem nearly identical to me.
See you tomorrow at the library.
You're worried.
Tom says he's on his way back home.
This showy dress isn't appropriate for me.
Tom was the first one to recognize Mary's musical talent.
We'll give it a shot.
What the devil are you doing?
Tom has potential.
There's a good restaurant not too far from here.
Have you fed the dog yet?
"Without your help, we wouldn't have finished in time."
"If you want to master a language, you need to learn to think in that language."
Today you can get two for the price of one.
Do you have any small change?
You said you loved me.
Do you want to resign?
Tom doesn't know what I want.
You're in no danger.
We haven't seen anyone.
I'm dancing.
There are 43 prefectures in Japan.
Tom seemed tough.
Tom tried to sing Mary to sleep.
I'm about to go out.
We can't afford to waste any more time.
Tom knows what to expect.
I am in charge here.
Don't set foot in that neighborhood.
Are you still there?
I consider fruit to be the healthiest food.
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints.
Mary will make a good nurse.
The house is five hundred years old.
"He's two years older than me, but he's shorter."
Do you like playing soccer?
"If you were in my shoes, what would you think?"
"It's so bad, it's hilarious."
The meeting will take place next Monday.
He promised me that he would come at four.
She didn't need to come.
You're unlucky.
Tom said that he wished he hadn't told Mary to try to convince John to do that.
I can't believe Tom and Mary have been together for ten years.
Aren't you just a little bit curious?
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
I can't breathe.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
Tom changed his mind after thinking over the matter for a long time.
Think before you speak.
Who else do you want to invite to the party?
Tom arrived very late.
The baby seemed to be fast asleep.
The bank isn't open on Sundays.
When will they appoint someone to replace Tom?
We enjoyed every minute of the party.
I never see you without thinking of my mother.
Tom wrote his number on a piece of paper and handed it to Mary.
You don't need to work today.
Why are you pretending you don't know me?
I always enjoy hearing you sing.
I was just mugged.
Smoking is strictly forbidden here.
My stomach hurts after meals.
Tom mentioned he was concerned about you.
He dropped his books on the floor.
Let go of the rope.
What I want now is a hot cup of coffee.
Tom is a cold-blooded murderer.
"I'm putting myself through school, so I can't have things that are that expensive."
I don't have to go to the doctor any more. I'm feeling much better.
I am tired of hearing it.
Can I use your pencil?
No problem.
We don't have another choice.
Tom and I were talking about Australia.
I respect you for what you have done.
Please come back at once.
Hawaii enjoys good weather the year round.
"In a few years, we'll all be doing that."
I will deal with this problem.
I still have a scar on my left leg from a car accident I was in when I was thirteen years old.
You didn't tell him anything?
They made fun of my clothes.
The laws were very difficult to enforce.
Don't worry. They will be supervised.
It is by no means certain.

What is it you'd like me to do exactly?
You're driving me crazy.
I can't find my shoes.
Tom has no idea what to do.
I've never seen such a scatterbrain.
I wonder what's inside the box.
We shouldn't have told Tom what we told him.
The Industrial Revolution took place first in England.
You don't have to come.
I didn't want to die.

He is just killing time.
Is there a golf course near here?
You can't possibly expect me to spend that much money on this piece of junk.
Don't ever do this again.
Where's the museum?
I'm not exactly surprised.
The Spanish soldiers used smokeless gunpowder.
I can do that right now.
Tom had no say in the matter.
I have never heard of him since then.
There's one small problem.
It was a well-aimed shot.
Tom was more than happy.
"We were worried that Tom might not make friends in Boston, but he seems to be doing OK."
They stood there.
His nasty comments fueled the argument.
I don't deserve it.
The post office is located in the center of the town.
Throw Tom the ball.
I should've become a teacher.
Do you know anything about his family?
Tom never told me about this.
I don't like doing that when it's raining.
The child offered a flower to the visitor.
I'm not worried about it at all.
Nothing much has changed.
I have a lot of money.

Tom pushed his plate away and said that he had eaten enough.
Why can't you come?
We mustn't let this news get out.
"Bring your kids, too."
I often visited his house.
My uncle has lived in Paris for ten years.
"Before I went to bed, I set the alarm clock for seven."
"If I had had a little more money, I would have bought it."
When does the rainy season end?
It was very ugly.
His daughter grew to be a beautiful woman.
"On hearing the news, everybody became quiet."
Tom was in a big hurry.
What language do they speak in the United States?
I think I should leave.
Let's call the dog Skipper.
Mary is getting on my nerves.
Tom came in carrying three cups of espresso.
They found something.
Your ideas are different from mine.

It's been a while since I've eaten anything with mustard.
Tom likes cats.
You may do whatever you want to.
We are expecting a baby.
The latest issue of the magazine will come out next Monday.
Don't be a coward.
Tom is still trying to get in.
Money is not everything.
It will be a great pleasure for me to translate the story and to read it to you.
They agree.
Does that frighten you?
That was the answer I wanted.
It's just not fair.
Mary hasn't watered her flowers yet.
I am indebted to him.
Did you take him back to your apartment?
I'm very surprised.
"If you've got a problem, I'd like to know what it is."
He was reading a newspaper.
"I've got a little surprise for you, Tom."
I couldn't have done this without your help.
You still have a lot to learn.
You have friends here.
He is fed up with my problems.
They're after us.
Tom is getting dressed.
It's almost midnight here.
Few students knew his name.
I could've met you at the airport.
He entered the bank disguised as a guard.
She trusted you.
Did you turn off the heater?
There are a lot of tall buildings in New York.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
I can't eat this kind of food.
She sympathized with the orphan and gave him some money.
I'm getting the hang of this new machine.
I've never loved you.
Her late husband was a violinist.
When did you hear the sound?
Look at the baby sleeping in the cradle.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
Does Tom still owe you money?
He goes to school by bicycle.
Do you have a ticket?
Can you come over here and help me?
I believe he is coming tomorrow.
It's what I want.
Please buy a tube of toothpaste.
"While in prison, Tom worked in the kitchen."
Why would Tom lie to you?
I teach French.
The best way to get better at French is to speak French with native speakers.
Table manners vary from one country to another.
Would you mind if I take a look?
The town was defended by a large army.
When shall I return the book?
I'm dying to know what's inside.
You can't blame this on us.
He tore the paper in two.
I remember the day I met you.
Tom won't admit that he was wrong.
Some people read books to kill time.
This bucket leaks.
"First, we will present a petition to the mayor and collect signatures."
"If I had one million yen now, I would buy a car."
Do you like the city?
"The Tatoeba Project, which can be found online at tatoeba.org, is working on creating a large database of example sentences translated into many languages."
They went crazy.
Tom said that somebody was after him.
You're starting to get really annoying.
She wanted to become a teacher.
It was just something I read in a newspaper.
It's nice to see Tom so happy.
I've been in therapy since I was thirteen.
Her mother was busy cooking dinner.
Tom is a very able teacher.
I understand that Tom does that.
Tom milked the cow.
He explained to me that he had no money.
Tom didn't sing.
Are you here with someone?
We want candy.
I think we did a good job.
How do you spell your family name?
What are you cooking today?
Tom called Mary some nasty names.
Please be gentle.
I figured you wouldn't want to go there without me.
Is she your mom?
I'm counting how many people there are.
"I tried to sell my old car, but nobody was interested in buying it."
"Will you show me your passport, please?"
You're going to need all the help you can get.
Tom appeared to be bewildered.
You need to apologize to her and need to do it right away.
She is particular about her dress.
Promises are made to be broken.
One is never too old to learn.
Where can one buy books?
Tom was in too much pain to speak.
Tokyo is supposed to be a very safe city.
I'm going to Paris.
She decided to study abroad.
This answer made him angry.
My cat ran away and never came back.
The company was in the red and went under.
I must go. It's getting dark.
I don't believe you've met Tom.

Cut it in half.
I don't want to stop working.
Here is a letter for you.
Do you have your own apartment?
May I open my eyes now?
"If you take this medicine, you'll feel a lot better."
Tom wondered who the man standing near the gate was.
They're looking for it.
It's difficult to explain.
May I take a picture of you?
When do you leave here?
He shooed the flies away.
Tom had an unusual thirst for knowledge.
A pilot guides the ship toward the port.
I should start packing.
I want to know why you did that.
I should probably tell Tom I'm busy.
Who's winning?
Are you planning on buying a new computer?
Let's invite some friends over for dinner.
Do you think it'd be fun to do that?
Have you thought of that?
Why are we hiding?
I'm no longer angry at you.
He was obviously drunk.
Where's the bathroom?
I don't care what you think of me.

I want to see you in my office.
You look very good.
There are rumors that he will resign.
I killed two birds with one stone.

I'm afraid of speaking in public.
Did you solve the problem?
Did Tom say why he wasn't coming?
"If we don't receive Tom's reply within the next three days, I think we should write him again."

The baby is one day old.
Who succeeded?
You're wasting ammo.
The law is full of ambiguities.
I'm sure they'll win.

Maybe it's a trap.
I want to talk to him about it.
He is at his desk.
Are you still awake?

Tom came by.
I don't remember Tom's face.
I don't see anything.
You can't put it off any longer.
Are you still mad at me?

"Tom loved to sing, but nobody wanted to listen to his singing."
We're enemies.
We can't leave Tom.
How do you know it won't happen again?
I don't think that he is sincere.
Talking to your plants doesn't help them grow faster.
Tell me what to do here.
I already spoke to someone in Tom's office.
What kind of help do you need?
Tom got up from the table and went into the kitchen.
I'll take those.
Do you know where Tom's car is parked?
The mountains look nicer from a distance.
Tom and Mary took turns taking care of John.
Please leave my things alone.
I mean it!
Why are you so insecure?

I think Tom knows why I'm here.
It would be fun.

That district is no longer a safe place to live in.
All the kids I grew up with could swim before they started going to school.
Nothing is the matter with me.

Thank you for stopping by.
It's always a pleasure to see you.
The soldiers halted at the entrance to the town.
I have a few books.
I don't have anything to eat.
The exhibition offers profound insights into ancient civilization.
That's embarrassing.
I am ready to die.
Tom is no longer welcome here.
Will you be home for dinner?
If only I had left home five minutes earlier.
I don't know where they hid the key.
I always wondered whether you'd come back.
It really hit the spot.
Get on in here.
Tom slept peacefully.
Tom was home.
We want to take it.
Nobody knows where it is.
The failure is due to his carelessness.
His behavior puzzled me.
Could you explain it to me?
Tom was very influential.
How long have you been playing the drums?
I thought everyone was busy.
Tom misses his family.
The candle went out by itself.
They're afraid of us.
I mistook you for your brother.
He is one of my best friends.
Tom passed with flying colors.
Please tell me the truth.
We're going to the movies. Come with us.
Are you happy with this?
Everyone wants something.
Tom is going to be heartbroken when he finds out his dog has died.
What did you do to get expelled from school?
Do you have any last wishes?
He had a falling-out with his friends.
Have you ever hired a maid?
Tom must be about thirty.
Do you object to smoking?
Some young Japanese people prefer being single to being married.
It is easy to be brave from a safe distance.
I now finally understand what Tom was trying to tell me.
There was no way to hide it.
It may rain tomorrow.
Tom called me about thirty minutes ago and said he was on his way.
Tom told me he knew where Mary lived.
We need you.
"Although it is a very difficult task, I will do my best."
Have you ever tried to learn another language?
Tom can't pronounce Mary's last name.

Cross the street.
Are you in trouble?
"Our planet, Earth, is always in motion."
I had bought it the week before.
Tom is lying unconscious on the ground.
I will never tell!
It nearly cost me my life.
He is more lucky than clever.
Do you like his songs?
His silence surprised me.
Please be patient with me today.
There is a white line in the middle of the road.
Everyone is going to call me a liar.
I'm just looking.
Tom didn't want Mary to talk to John.
Even men sometimes cry.
"Whatever it is, I didn't do it."
"Hey, Tom, are you here?"
What are you studying?
We are excited at the news.
It was night.
Tom became bored with teaching and he looked for a new job.
It's a nice party.
Spare me the details.
The ship sank with all her crew on board.
I took the day off.
I have known him for more than ten years.

I talked to her on the telephone.
I paid him four dollars.
What books have you read in French?
The club has thirty members.
Show me where the pain is.
Tom seldom wears his black shirt.
My parents have kicked me out of the house.
Have you visited a zoo in your country?
You're not too old to do that.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
I can teach you how to dance.
"Take this medicine, and you'll feel a lot better."
Keep the cat off the couch.
A lot can happen in three hours.
I hope that all your dreams come true.
What was discussed?
Tom lied.
Is this your first time here?
It has no bearing on this problem.
This is all entirely my fault.
I have no clue.

Ask Tom to bring Mary tomorrow.

Your father is tall.
Could you tell me how to get to the ballpark?
We need not have hurried.
I hope that he will help me.
"Tom, are you sure you're all right?"
He is not scared of snakes at all.
Many young Japanese travel overseas these days.
I'd be curious to know what Tom has to say.
You are absolutely right.
It didn't take you long to get here.
I know you are rich.
We missed the deadline.
We can't let you do that.
Tom made me angry.
What would you do if you were in Tom's situation?
I can't ignore that.
He was paralyzed with terror.
I study French for three hours every day.
What do you mean by that?
I thought you might know where Tom went.
How old are you?
Tom lay on a sofa with his eyes closed.
Tom had a lot of problems at the school.
She's not my girlfriend.
He dumped me.

Who do you think will win?
There's an even easier way to do it.
Pleased to meet you.
We'll drive.
Which newspaper do you read?
Tom was unhappy.
"Tom insisted he hadn't been drinking, but his slurred speech and unsteady gait gave him away."
I used to like walking in the rain when I was a child.
I forgot Tom knew how to read French.
Do you understand or not?
I'm sure he will come tomorrow.
I like learning ancient languages.
It is stupid of you to believe in him.
Tom might not be as hungry as you think he is.
Does Tom have to do this?
He took her out for a drive.
You have to change trains at the next stop.
I don't like this CD.
Do you wanna go out with me tonight?

I'm here to protect you.
I'd like a little more time.
The escaped convict is armed and dangerous.
We just had to deal with it.
We heard the church bells.
I left my pack in a coin locker at the train station.
Tom left early in the morning.
What does that have to do with me?
I'm not wearing that.
"Come on, Tom. Just do it already. What are you waiting for?"
Somebody called.
Please tell me how to do that.
Shut up and kiss me.
I wonder why Tom is sad.
May I ask a question?
The foreigner didn't know Japanese at all.
She took no pleasure in eating or drinking.
I'll meet to you at eight.
Whose notebook is that?
I haven't the faintest idea.
They lived in a village close to a forest.
I was not disappointed.
It's time to take a bath.
I thought you were raised in Boston.
Tom giggled girlishly.
Mary has very long hair.
We'll soon change that.
Please give it a try.
Did you bring rolls?
Can I borrow $30?
These are the new ones.
Tom is not jealous.
This is great.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Will it bother you if I turn on the radio?
Have you ever seen a purple butterfly?
No one will survive.
Who let you in here?
"It may seem like a good idea to you, but I think it's a little dangerous."
This tea tastes good.
"Tom named his boat after his girlfriend, but then she left him."
You can't give me orders.
There are certainly some points worth considering.
They're not like us.
Tom doesn't know how to do it.
Tom isn't a religious person.
How long will you stay here?
Where does Tom usually eat lunch?
You know that's your duty.
When does life begin?
I'm not tired at all.
Tom travels a great deal.
Tom went to church with Mary.
They're my books.
It's a quarter to three.
I'll make sure Tom gets this.
I can't agree with them on this matter.
I didn't understand what you said.
Tom would've made the same decision I'm making if he were in my shoes.
Books are for people who wish they were somewhere else.
Don't get mixed up in that.
I hear that she's a famous actress.
Are there any direct flights between Boston and Sydney?
There was widespread panic after the earthquake.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions.
We should go inside the house.

This may be of use to you.
This pair of trousers is just right for me.
Tom got muddy playing football.
Open the door.
"Sooner or later, he will run out of luck."

It's good to see you again.
Were you in Australia last summer?

The last time I spoke to Tom was last Monday.
Would you mind opening the window?
Was I snoring?
He resembles his grandfather.
Tom teaches French.
I just need to talk to you.
Try it again.
We've got to save Tom.
We're gonna make sure that no one is taking advantage of the American people for their own short-term gain.
I'll even buy you a new car if you want one.
I don't know where to go.
Don't think about it. Do it.
Are we going far?
What happened to you last night?
Tom is deaf in the left ear.
I owe you an apology.
Did you watch the movie?
We waited in the movie theater for the film to start.
It's hard to say.
Please read that book.
I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee.
The child will be six.
The storm is getting worse.
The dog went away.
I have nothing to say to you.
"I'm still Mary's boyfriend, I think."
Tom is in need of help.
You don't know a thing about me.
I made you breakfast.
I gave Tom one of those.
Did you get her letter?
He is chubby.
Tom finally realized that Mary was never going to consider him her boyfriend.
Are we leaving?
What are they looking for?
The helicopter landed on the roof.
"Tom was asleep on the couch, snoring loudly."
"If I knew her address, I would write to her."
Don't give the dog anything to eat.
Tom left home at 2:30.
We can't go back.
You're paying.
Help me.
I eat Thai food every chance I get.
"You're going with me, aren't you?"
That's what I'd like to know.
I can't bear this pain.
Go away.
I have a friend whose father is an animal doctor.
Tell us about your family.
He is no longer welcome here.
I have to run away.
Everyone dreams.
The floor is very slippery.
Tom doesn't like any kind of spicy food.
I know your brother very well.
How many people do you know well?
Tom knows everything there is to know about Italian cars.
I wish it was that easy.
Tom and Mary didn't do anything we wanted them to do.
I can't remember whether I turned off the gas or not.
I let Tom borrow my baseball glove.
Tom clearly doesn't want to talk about it anymore.
I can't stand being laughed at in public.
I don't like what I see.
Tom will do whatever it takes to win.
Would you check this?
Do you eat breakfast every day?
Look how happy you made Tom.
Did you pay for the book?
You'd better tell Tom you're sorry.
He was supposed to go to school.
I have to introduce Tom to the manager.
He joined the United States Navy.
Tom is completely confused.
My words were taken out of context.
Would you like to sit?
I got lost trying to find the library.
The rumor spread all over the town.
He gets a haircut once a month.
Tom believed the story that Mary told him.
My mother always wears a kimono at home.
Why don't you take this medicine for a few days and let's see if it works?
"Yeah, that's what I'd do."
Tom now has a good reason to be happy.
The young girl burst into tears.
I can't order Tom to be happy.
Do you think I still love her?
Why did you guys leave?
Tom thinks it's great.
Tom tried to contact Mary.
Can you get something to eat in there?

Where's the butter?
Tom is lying on the sofa watching TV.
I'm so happy to finally be back home.
My sister is playing with a doll.
Don't you want me to do anything?
Have a nice weekend.
She is very annoyed with me.
"Tom is the one with experience, not me."
Does Tom have a car?
All is fair in love and war.
Why is Tom coming here?
Do you really think Tom is going to be there?
I had nothing to do with that.
Don't believe Tom.
What happened to the money?
He disregarded my advice.
She was surprised that it was that late.
Do you not want me here?
They can't get out.
"All of a sudden, three dogs appeared in front of us."
Tom bought a bottle of cheap wine.
She came home in low spirits.
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I think he did it.
Will you take care of the children while I'm out?
We're not going to give Tom the money he asked for.
I wrote a long letter to her.
How old do you think Tom is?
I brought mine. Did you bring yours?
What are you doing down here?
"Yesterday, I got a call out of the blue from Tom."
Tom asked again.
"From now on, let's keep in touch."
I have a very bad earache.
He knows how to waste his time.
Almost everyone in our village is related to one another.
Do you remember how slow the Internet used to be?
I have to go. It's getting late.
I love dogs.
"Unfortunately, I missed all the fun."
Tom was framed.
"Leave us alone, please."
I don't have much money.
He just missed the bus.
Perhaps Tom can help you find a job.
Tom owns two houses and a boat.
Let me ask you something.
Don't believe anything Tom says.
Twelve is an even number.
Tom never gives anything to anybody.
Do you often go to town?
Tom still has to pay the bill.
I think you're exaggerating.
I can't find my glasses anywhere.
We should go back to the ship.
Tom went there to meet Mary.
Today's meeting has been canceled.
Winter is coming.
Tom still calls me from time to time.
Tom said that he didn't want to talk to me.
You look sharp.
How come you ask?
Do you study English every day?
They will understand.
I'll never let you down.
How many times do I need to repeat it?
Tom will be able to swim soon.
Tom was impatient.
"Which do you like better, the sea or the mountains?"
My brother gave me a cute doll.
That's what I have to do.
Finishing this job by Tuesday will be a piece of cake.
I should've listened to Tom instead of Mary.
I'll lend you my textbook if you promise not to write anything in it.
Does he still have a temperature?
We can hear the ocean from here.
My mother is busy in the kitchen.
I can't explain it either.
Tom doesn't like pork.
I'll do what I want.
Do you have this in my size?
I will try as hard as I can.
The only room available is a double.
Tom is writing an autobiography.
The key is on the desk.
Could you tell me how to get to Park Street from here?
What have you promised to do?
"He seldom, if ever, laughs."
I got mad.
The girl went to sleep.
Tom scares easy.
Could I get a discount if I pay in cash?
The story didn't sound true.
She cannot stop it.
I made a good profit by selling my car.
"If you don't like Tom, just try to avoid him."
Tom lives somewhere around here.
That hat becomes you.
I couldn't stop.
What a beautiful view!
It's no longer pitch black outside.
That's a relief.
Tom isn't accustomed to walking barefooted.
I could have sworn I saw somebody.
A lot of soldiers were killed here.
I don't know where Tom came from.
Can I see you again?
The fun didn't last long.
That remains to be seen.
Don't fail to be here at 7 o'clock sharp.
I have a big dog.
Tom extended his stay by three days.
They say that Venice is a beautiful city.
Tom isn't in a good mood.
My wife has just cleared the table.

Where are you taking us?
Take us there.

They were caught smoking.
Do you have any idea who wrote this book?
Tom was extraordinarily handsome.
May I go first?

Is there a problem with your hearing?
I'm not going to put up with this.
I have a surprise for you.
Here's a photo of her.
Tom said he couldn't find a decent place to live.
I love your garden.
Let the matter rest until I get back.
I planted roses in the garden.
I think I could learn a lot from you.
I don't think you're crazy.
Let me do that for you.
How do you know there isn't one?
I think I'll go home.
Please write to me from time to time.
I'm over the shock.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
May God reward you.
I don't want to interfere.
You seem depressed.
You had better go to bed now.
What I want is to know what happened and why.
She herself gave him something to eat.
"He looks old, but he hasn't reached 30 yet."
I made that up.
He is not the sort of guy who gives in easily.
"I'm interested in doing that, but Tom isn't."
This watch is broken.
I would like some more water.
"I can't see what the two of them are doing, but they are making a lot of noise."
How long have you been standing here?
Where are the rest of the files?
Tom and Mary don't get along together.
Watch out for the sparks that are flying out of the fireplace!
It is not easy to be understood by everybody.
How about a song?
You're three inches taller than I am.
Have you ever gone skinny dipping?
She kept working even though she was tired.
You need to get ready.
Gold is far heavier than water.
He is my uncle.
I want to drink a cup of tea.
I don't think we're losing.
She cooks things for me that I like.
Tom rarely laughs.
I thought Tom had stopped dating Mary.
Don't walk so fast.
Thanks for helping me fix my car.
The word is no longer in use.
You need to learn not to ask so many questions.
There's a small campground on the south shore of the lake.
"You had a good time, didn't you?"
Will this do?
They're on the same team.
I forgot to turn off the lights.
Tom wishes he could speak French as well as he speaks English.
No one seems to smile anymore.
I still think Tom is innocent.
Check your tire pressure.
I speak from experience.
"Tom, are you okay?"
Is there any chance of your coming to Tokyo again this year?
You don't have to come tomorrow.
Tom ran to catch the last train.
Tom must be tired now.
There are many people in the park.
Tom is coming.
I can smell something cooking.
What do you have for me today?
Tom is working on your car.
"As soon as he saw the policeman, he ran away."
Do you want another one of these?
The plumber used many different tools to fix our sink.
He seemed really nervous.
He's not paying any attention to me.
Let's try to read between the lines.
I will graduate in two years.
I hope Tom's behaving himself.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
You'll like this.
You don't need to worry.
Everybody loves him.
I will go on ahead.
What size helmet do you wear?
It's about to explode!
I objected when the waiter tried to remove my plate.
I find it hard to believe that Tom was involved in the kidnapping.
Have you ever read a book written about Japan?
We must clean up the kitchen.
I knew it was Tom's handwriting.
She stood in front of the mirror.
This base is now under our control.
Tom is obviously very good with his hands.
Do you have Saturday off?
I wish I were rich.
Tom is the one that has been waiting the longest.
I want you to tell Tom that you don't love him anymore.
Let's speak in English.
"No, Mary isn't my stepsister, she's my half sister."
I like to advise people.
I'd like to make a reservation for 6 o'clock tomorrow.
Tom saw Mary and John holding hands.
His courage is worthy of high praise.
When did you start writing songs?
I really have to go.
No one understands me.
Not everyone is honest.
There are only three girls in the class.
Have I ever met you before?
I'm glad you noticed.
It's a free country.
The morning sun is too bright to look at.
Please lower the flag.
Tom was killed by a stray bullet.
"Tom wasn't the most popular kid in school, but he had a lot of friends."
How could you know this was going to happen?
He said his name was Tom.
"No pain, no gain."
I just want to talk to you.
I had to work overtime yesterday.
I think you're going to survive.
I should never have started smoking.
Don't let the children monopolize the television.
Many lives were lost.
Fix this.
Tom is extremely generous.
It was urgent.
She altered her plans.
Put the dough in the refrigerator overnight.
This is the best book that I've ever read.
I usually do the dishes.
Tom is the worst student in the class.
We should study.
What's the safest way to defuse a bomb?
I had to arrest Tom.
Will you come and see me?
Give Tom a second chance.
It's not against the law.
The poor boys were shivering with fear.
Tom isn't inside.
Is there a reward?
Tom didn't know how to reply.
I know the name of this animal.
I no longer study French.
They know how to swim.
I am right for once.
How can I help?
The unemployment rate went up to 5%.
Tom appreciated Mary's honesty.
I will speak to you tomorrow.
Did Tom contact you?
I went to Sendai and hurried right back.
We didn't find Tom.
Do you realize what declaring war entails?
Your soul belongs to me.
"If he had been honest, they would have employed him."
The children played together.
Tom can't help thinking about Mary.
Tom impressed me.
Tom isn't doing this to me again.
I know that you are learning French at school.
Who is that?
The results of the election will appear in the evening paper.
Tom writes everything down so he won't forget it.
Who are you afraid of?
You're not getting it.
"You've done this before, haven't you?"
Tom is paying a fine.
You can take a taxi.
I'm glad I was able to help you last week.
She stepped forward to shake his hand.
I think Tom would do that for you if you asked him to.
Which direction did he go?
I think that you're right.
I waited for her for a really long time.
The class went wild.
Tom likes to dunk his biscuit in his coffee.
He can speak and write French.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
You're going to be a good father.
Don't cry.
Let's do this properly.
I hope I never meet him again.
His wealth got him into the club.
Aomori is famous for its good apples.
I arrived at the station on time.
I guess that she is over thirty.
"He's two years older than I am, but he's shorter than I am."
The police showed me your picture.
That's what love is.
Can you believe what he said?
When did Tom get married?
I can't stand it here any longer. I need a change of scenery.
Take over.
I'll be at home the next time she comes.
The dog growled.
You will soon come to like this town.
That's all in the past now.
I enjoyed talking with him.
Reading books is very relaxing.
His socks are gray.
Did you think I wouldn't notice?
What will we do with the leftover bread?
We really need to talk to Tom.
You should read this.
That's what I thought you said.
Tom's grandfather was illiterate.
He is always on the move.
Do you have psychic powers?
I didn't want to scare you.
Tom's alibi has been corroborated.
I'm not taking the bus.
I think you know I like you.
Do you know my father?
The pigeon has flown the coop.
Do you know how to get to our place?
He asked his father to take him to the store.
Tom's upset.
"Hey, what happened?"
Tom bought that pair of shoes at a clearance sale.
It's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
"Go to sleep, Tom. You need to wake up early tomorrow morning."
I hope Tom comes.
I haven't seen him since then.
We're bored.
It's really not worth the effort.
Clean the room.
Do you see that house? It's mine.
Tom wants me to help you.
I'm using common sense.
Tom didn't want Mary to play with his kid.
She stayed at the hotel for several days.
I paid to have this done.
How did you end up in Boston?
I sympathize.
I think you'll be happy here.
Look up the phrase in your dictionary.
Angola was once a Portuguese territory.
I have a headache today.
I understand your concern.
What shall we eat tonight?
Tom asked Mary if he could borrow her bicycle.
What did you talk about?
"How are you and your wife doing, now that the birds have all flown the coop?"
Tom forgot to feed his dog last night.
Your friend is very lucky.
You can forget about that.
Could you show me the way to the bus stop?
The meeting is to be held at three.
Tom gets along with everyone.
Tom doesn't know who to turn to.
He is not conscious of his own faults.
I was too happy to sleep.
This has nothing to do with what we were talking about.
Tom is good at causing problems.
"You don't really mean it, do you?"
Do you believe in reincarnation?
He doesn't like to wait until the last moment to do something.
She owns two thousand books.
"Lake Titicaca, the biggest lake in South America, is in Peru."
I haven't read the report.
This suitcase is too heavy for you.
I just don't love Tom.

Are you going to tell Tom what I did?
Have you ever wanted something so much that you'd do anything to get it?

How old do you think Tom is?
Are you in a bad mood?

That's logical.

This is a free sample.
Tom lives somewhere around here.

Take a bite.
Tom makes me feel safe.
Tom and Mary are intelligent people.
Tom has been grounded for a week.
Tom is pleasant.
She has platinum blonde hair.
Did you forget to feed the dog?
Why didn't you just call in sick?

The district is abundant in natural resources.
Tom looked tense.
I think I'll do that.

I can't say I'm terribly proud of what I did.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
There's one more thing we need to discuss.
My watch was stolen.
I don't like my school.
I have to support a large family.
Singapore looks very nice in this picture.
I have no money in my pocket.
Tom is going to have to do that.
They will be very glad.

I've gotten kind of used to it.
You can put your name on a name tag.
Don't try to make me angry.
Walk ahead of me.
You should ask your parents for permission.
Why are you so busy?
I think it's time for me to confront that problem.
My major is linguistics.
What are you going to make?
Tom took a day off.
I'm tired and I want to go home.
You ought to know that.
I came here to give you a gift.
Tom climbed down from the tree.
You don't need to do that right away.
Please remember to wake me up at seven tomorrow.
They ate some enchiladas.
We had a long wait for the bus.
Love is not a crime.
How could I lie to you?
Did Tom believe it?
I must get my hair cut.
I spent a couple of months in Australia.
He had a stroke.
Do any of you know Tom?
I have been busy writing a short story.
I really missed you.
He spoke well of her son.
Tom is listening to Mary.
Tom knew that Mary was hungry.
Mary was Tom's first girlfriend.
I really feel like crying right now.
We're leaving.
You should know by now that I can't speak French very well.
I can talk about anything with my best friend.
Tom hasn't been able to go to school for three weeks.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
That's the last straw.
Tom struggles to make ends meet.
This play has three acts.
You don't need to tell Tom everything.
The road is under repair.
I'm just under 150 centimeters tall.
Tom certainly made no attempt to help us.
Tom loves you.
What's that your wearing?
That's why I told you not to go by yourself.
Tom would be tough to replace.
Could you turn the volume down?
How do you like my new suit?
We'll let you know.
"I'm really happy for you, Tom."
We're going to get you home.
I wonder what Tom would think about this.
Tom still loves Mary.
I saw Tom before he saw me.
Thanks for listening.
She hates green peppers.
I took it for granted that she would come.
This question is difficult to answer.
This time I'm paying.
You're fascinating.
Come back tomorrow.
I don't think Tom is a loser.
Put those cushions on the couch.
Where do you want me to put this?
Tom went to Boston three months ago.
Tom got three presents for his birthday.
I'm assuming that the gunshot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
Tom and Mary never did like each other much.
That's not an easy feat.
The water flows under the bridge.
What would you like to have?
When do you eat dinner?
This cloth feels like velvet.
Do you remember the first time I came here?
You can't go.
I wanted to do that with you.

Everything went smoothly.
You look sad. What's wrong?
He graduated from Cambridge with honors.
Tom is allergic to eggs.
I'm willing to accept your offer.
I know that Tom works very hard.
I'd like to know your opinion.
Tom is awake now.
I want to buy some dark glasses.
Am I ever going to see you again?
Where were you three years ago?
She helps him.
There are cherry trees on both sides of the street.
"Where's Tom? ""I don't know. I can't find him."""
Who are the people I saw her with?
Tom's smarter than we are.
I spoke with her for one hour.
What's your opinion of Japanese food?
Tom likes to play basketball.
Do you want another one of these?
"I like music, particularly classical music."
Tom may not come.
We lost sight of the UFO right away.
Everybody was jealous of my success.
Tom worked day and night for weeks to meet the deadline.
Tom's father is rich.
He was compelled to sign the contract.
Tom has lived in New York since he was a child.
That's not my cup of tea.
Tom was told he couldn't win.
Why do rabbits have long ears?
There's nothing to do.
I was too surprised to speak.
I assume you're angry.
Tom almost always gets home from school before 5:30.
The rumor can't be true.
One of my teeth hurts.
School starts April 8th.
I like to drive.
There was nothing on the radio about the accident.
Tom sat in the waiting room reading a magazine.
Do you need to go?
I'll be doing that with Tom.
They liked Tom.
Honey doesn't spoil.
Please follow me.
He speaks Russian.
I believe you've been had.
You're killing me.
I've made the change I was advised to make.
"Where's your cousin? ""He just left."""
You'll do what you have to do.
There is a monster under my bed.
"Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he had no choice."
You're the love of my life.
Do you think that it's wrong to date a guy who's 8 years older than you?
I love her and she loves me.
I could use some sleep.
I'm sure you already know what to do.
It's bedtime.
I stayed with my uncle.
What we do is up to you.
Can you count in Italian?
Can you hear us?
How can I change the ringtone on my phone?
It's as much an art as a science.
I need your help.
I'm so proud to know that she's mine.
It isn't what he says that annoys me but the way he says it.
I wish Tom would help me move the sofa.
We know that Tom has been shot. That's all we know.
He stayed there for three days.
You mustn't keep a lady waiting.
Doesn't it taste good?
I'll take care of it as soon as I can.
This car is fast.
I'll take care of the bill.
"When he saw me, he ran away."
Tom persuaded Mary to study French with him.
Tom nodded his head in approval.
I didn't notice it.
They don't even know why.
You're useless.
Tom chased after Mary.
I think you should swim.
I fully agree with you.
Keep your room as neat as you can.
The peace talks failed once again.
We're the only ones here who know French.
He took part in the anti-war demonstration.
I hope Tom says yes.
Today there are many things made of sheet metal.
You have to obey the law.
I have neither time nor money for that.
We want to thank you for coming.
Tom admitted that.
I've got nothing left.
Read the bottom of the page.
You do have a point.
I'll miss you so much when you leave in June.
I want Tom to go.
I'm not sure of anything.
Tom's voice was calm.
Are you talking to yourself?
Tom and Mary have been happily married for thirteen years.
Please look at me.
"In America, the consumption of fast-food has tripled between 1977 and 1995."
They were busy.
I've worked here for ten years.
Tom felt excluded.
She was slightly better yesterday.
Are they your friends?
Are you sure?
She spends most of her money on clothes.
The only thing we can do is wait.
That's terrifying.
He seated himself on the bench.
Do you think Tom is really sorry?
Get me something to drink.
Tom's in love with Mary's best friend.
Tom raised his hand.
May I trouble you to shut the window?
Conflicting reports prompted the director to reconsider her position.
I had a dog when I was a kid.
Tom couldn't remember what he had intended to say.
You go first.
Did you mean this?
Funeral services will take place in the cathedral.
That's quite a problem.
The author presented a copy of his latest book to me.
This bridge is twice the length of that one.
Tom took off his glasses and put them down on his desk.
She didn't tell me her secret.
He may be sick in bed.
Tom poured himself another cup of coffee.
He'll catch up with us in an hour.
"I agree with him. ""So do I."""
I don't think I have much longer to live.
Tom works for a think tank.
I don't like either of them.
That's all I need to hear.
Do whatever it takes.
It's dark inside.
She doesn't pay much attention to how she dresses.
Tom offered a reward for the return of his lost dog.
Tom and Mary discussed their plans for the future.
Tom majored in music education.
We are not speaking.
Tom turned the music off.
Why didn't somebody call me?
I haven't been in Australia very long.
Did you read this morning's newspaper?
Someday I'll buy a cotton candy machine.
He did the opposite.
He is one of the most famous singers in Japan.
Luckily nobody got killed.
This is where I went to school.
Tom isn't as strong as before.
I have nothing further to say.
"You won't tell Tom, will you?"
We will keep the room warm.
He is unmarried.
Are you sure that man is a doctor?
There's nobody on this ship except us.
That's what most of my friends call me.
You have to go there whether you like it or not.
Tom always said he wanted to learn how to play mahjong.
It is impossible for a growing child to keep still for an hour.
I live in comfort.
I gave her a lift to town.
She allowed him to go alone.
I miss it.
"You know how important this job is to me, don't you?"
"If you know who killed Tom, you should tell the police."
Where's Tom when you need him?
I have been absorbed in reading a mystery.
It was hard for them to get to the island.
I don't care what you think of me.
Do you want to do it with me?
I intended to visit Rome last year.
A promise is a promise.
Your English is improving.
Has he come?
"You know what it is, don't you?"
She let him drive on his own.
Tom ran up the stairs.
You sound very sure of yourself.
He behaved like a child.
Please give me a spool of white thread.
Jose is lactose intolerant.
Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
"If I could've prevented this, I would've."
I want to see the roses.
I can assure you we'll never make that mistake again.
Were you expecting someone?
I'll never get over that.
Tom didn't mean to disappoint Mary.
It took me an hour to learn the poem by heart.
This is not a sentence.
I should probably lose a little weight.
How many hours does it take to get from Boston to Chicago by plane?
The girl swimming in the pool is my cousin.
Tom works as a bouncer.
Are you still here?
Don't sleep in the bathtub.

Is this the first time you've eaten Japanese food?
Tom was arrested for being drunk and disorderly.
I'm all right.
He felt her hand on his shoulder.
It had started to rain.
I miss you.
Excuse me.
He killed himself.
He is always giving people a lot of trouble.
They'll come looking for you.
Cats like boxes.
We're horrible.
I think Tom wants something to write on.
Tom lied to Mary about where he'd been.
Let us know if you're coming.
Does the story have a happy ending?
"Tom is rich, but not me."
What he's doing is against the law.
What's your motivation?
Your selfishness will lose you your friends.
I didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
I'm really mad at Tom right now.
Take your time.
I understand what you mean.
You're still young.
Do you feel pain in any other part of your body?
That's a great poem.
He is similar to his father.
Everyone has their own bedroom.
"Boys, don't make any noise."
"Be sure to get in touch with me, if there is anything I can do for you."
"Tom tried his best to move the table by himself, but he couldn't."
She tempted him.
Maybe it won't rain tomorrow.
"When I got home, I noticed that I had lost my wallet."
Finish your work.
How is it made?
He isn't as stupid as he looks.
I'm drinking water because I'm thirsty.
You must not speak Japanese during the class.

Why do you know so much about Australia?
We cannot thank you enough.
I didn't know that most birds can't see at night.
Tom gave me something that I needed.
Who is it that you want to talk to?
He told me the story of his life.
He impressed me with his magic tricks.
I'm not that surprised by it.
Come take a look.
Why don't we talk about this now?
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Maybe I don't want to know.
The scientists gathered data.
Mary is weird.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Guys are stupid.
My watch gains one minute a day.
Don't shout at me. I can hear you all right.
Divide the money among you.
This package requires special treatment.
That is quite possible.
This room smells musty.

He looks like a horse.
The actress always wears expensive jewels.
I want to know where you live.
I just want your love.
Tom can hardly wait to meet you.

My neighbors usually have their TV on all night long.
We're not looking.
I didn't buy anything at that store.

They enjoy one another's company.

It doesn't make Tom happy.
Can I sit with you?
What's the speed limit on this road?
Tom may choose whichever color he likes.
Would you mind opening the window?
I'll wait for you here.
Tom didn't care about that anymore.
Would you like to play with us?
I suppose that's true.
Would you like to play a game of chess?
Tom's hands were tightly clenched into fists.
It's difficult to answer this question.
I hope that he will succeed.
"I'd like two tickets, please."
Tom is too busy now to talk to you.
I fell in love with her at first sight.
Plants require CO2 to grow.
You can't possibly be serious.
I want us to be friends again.
You should go on a diet.
It must've been very painful.
Tom walked over to where Mary was sitting.
She ran out of paper.
How often do you brush your teeth?
We suffered a devastating loss.
She's only a child.
I wish the circumstances were different.
We have a break from 10:40 to 11:00.

I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
They all drowned.
The oil spill polluted the bay.
I want an English muffin.
I can't pass up this chance.

Can she come in time?
Neither was true.
He accused me of having stolen his watch.
Why not ask Tom?
You can count on her.
Did you know that before?
These people have lost everything.
Don't you like any of these?
Let's try once again.
We were all running short of money then.
Are you guys really cousins?
We don't know what to do.
He sat down and read the paper.
Could you please put that somewhere else?
We don't get along with each other.
I hope Tom isn't doing something he isn't supposed to be doing.
You'll feel at home.
Tom was in the shower.
Do you study French every day?
It makes me kind of happy.
We went to Lake Towada on a school excursion.
Why didn't you say goodbye?
We canoed downstream.
Are you ready to fly?
They're afraid of Tom.
He shot at me.
It's not complicated.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
Why didn't you ever tell us?
Could you do that for me?
What a big supermarket!
Tom's radio is broken.
We'd like you to sing a song.
Tom became famous.
He can't stay long.

I'll have Tom look at it.
We're not in love. We're just good friends.
She came alone.
Tom didn't speak.
My uncle has a large family.
I think Tom isn't a very good singer.
How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?
Tell me what has become of him.
He would not approve.
She attacked him.
Tom didn't have the courage to pull the trigger.
We're happy to see you again.
There are too many people in this room.
Tom rinsed out his mug and then refilled it with coffee.
Tom is saving money for a trip to Australia.
That man was fired last week.
The furniture in this office is really modern.
Tom wasn't able to find a job.
That bridge across this river is the oldest in the town.
Tom has barely said a word all day.
Are there any other possibilities?
Tom can't decide whether to buy a new computer now or wait for a couple of more months.

Tom never got married.
Do you think Tom is unreliable?
I played soccer yesterday.
We're trying our best to do it.
I wish Tom would stay.
I hope we'll be seeing you around here soon.
This data isn't accurate at all.
All the money was spent on clothes.
Her father is a bank clerk.
This diagram will illustrate what I mean.
What're you doing here?
Tom pulled Mary out of the burning car.
I had a good time last evening.
I've asked you repeatedly to do that.
I got the bicycle at a bargain.
We don't have to buy from that store anymore.
Tom tried to pry open the box.
I had a fantastic time.
He was not pleased.
What would you do differently?
I suspect he is ill.
Let me know if you need my help.
When did you find out?
She was brave.
My foot's asleep again!
Nothing is more important than friendship.
Tom has three cats.
Those are my trousers.
Don't be like Tom.
Since when do you care about that?
Obey your father.
What does Tom do on Mondays?
Let's keep it secret that he is ill.
Why aren't you with Tom?
Do what he says.
This melody is familiar to many Japanese.
We agreed to refrain from smoking while we are at work.
Rules are meant to be broken.
I thought about it a lot.
He wore a coat too large for him.
I am convinced of your innocence.
He gave a vague answer.
That old man caught a large fish.
It's easier to teach children than adults.
The wind calmed down.
You need to apologize.
I wonder how long this cold weather will last.
Everyone believed his lie.
I need a stopwatch.
I might be able to convince Tom to do that.
The man ate bread.
Do you know what this is?
Tom says that he doesn't want to do that.
I had a small mishap.
So what are you implying?
She is beautiful.
Nothing's worse than having all the time in the world and no one to spend it with.
I know what it takes.
"According to the papers, the man has finally confessed."
Tom listens to me.
I wasn't trying to trick you.
He's in big trouble.
I forgot my own birthday.
I now know it's possible.
The room is at the end of the hall.
Tom is busy this afternoon.
Switzerland is a beautiful country worth visiting.
Tom smokes.
That ticket is good until April 29th.
Tom has blond hair and green eyes.
I don't recognize over half of these names.
I like teaching French.
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.
Tom doesn't know Mary is here.
"Tom is left-handed, but he writes with his right hand."
You can tell me the truth.
Can I get a little assistance here?
I can't be late.
"Run, Tom. Get out of here!"
May I ask where you work?
There's no other way to do this.
"There were no customers, so we closed the shop early."
Don't leave us.
I lost track of time.
"Of all the countries I've visited, I liked Australia the best."
Tom came forward.
Mary and Alice are Tom's sisters.
I'm going to miss your cooking.
I wish I could buy that guitar.
They all tried to talk at one time.
This has been your problem from the beginning.
I sat at the bar by myself.

Don't risk your life for me.
Where's your sister?
He didn't want to disappoint his mother.
It was Tom's.
Mary wore a silver pin on her coat.
He said that he wanted some money.
What do you need?

I saw that.
It must have slipped my mind.
Where has Tom gone?
I usually try to do what everybody else does.
I'll have what he's having.
I have visited the place time after time.
Tom has gambling debts.
I asked for a seat in the no-smoking section.
"Within days, Japan captured the American island of Guam."
We all enjoyed it.

A word spoken is past recalling.
Tom is much older than Mary.
Tom and Mary are waiting at the park entrance.
She usually wears jeans.
The stars are shining in the sky.
Have you actually ever tried it?
I spent the whole afternoon chatting with friends.
Tom doesn't let people into his house.
Your cat is overweight.
Her face is covered with pimples.
"You've lost weight, haven't you?"
It's not safe to drive without wearing a seatbelt.
We waited but he failed to arrive.
It is raining hard.
"The first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, launched by Russia in 1957."
You sure are dirty.
Tom made his bed.
Do you always greet people that way?
I wonder why it's so crowded here today.
My father goes jogging every morning.
I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
I'm just going to go powder my nose.
Tom and I are scared.
Tom didn't answer at first.
Don't sneak up on me like that.
He was accompanied by his aunt.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
This is one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen.
Japanese is harder than English.
Tom wants popcorn.
Tom walked down the hall alone.
Tom had only one leg.
I will miss you all.
You're very nice.
I'll tell Tom you asked.
The island is very easy to reach.
The company accepted his application.
How can you be so calm?
Aren't you looking for Tom?

I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Boston.
I'm glad I could help you.
Tom can't believe Mary let herself get caught.
The preacher gave a beautiful sermon.

You can't stay for long.
Just tell me what you know about the problem.

Ask her her name.
She has achieved her goals.
You're a workaholic.
Tom seldom asks questions.
"If she were here now, I would tell her the truth."
I've been out running around all day.

What's that sound?
Don't you see what's happening here?
What's your dad's name?
She hasn't been to the dentist's for years.
I can't deny that.
Tom offered me a piece of cake.
You can go if you want.
"Judging from the expression on her face, she is worried."
You just can't ignore it.
Do you have a tattoo?
I skipped my breakfast.
It snowed a lot.
Shakespeare is too hard to read.
I am attracted to a certain boy in my class.
How much did you have to pay for the tickets?
I can sleep anywhere.
Don't take Tom too seriously.
I want to move out of this cramped room as soon as I can.
Tom knows what we're doing.
We sell sugar by the pound.
The door will not open.
Tom didn't want people to think that he was flirting with Mary.
How do you want me to do that?
It's by no means impossible to earn one million yen a month.
He has been busy since this morning.
Come again.
I won't get caught.
It isn't good.
He is photogenic.
Will that briefcase hold many books?
I really do like you.
They don't know me.
Tom must be a good teacher.
Tom's sister is younger than mine.
I heard her speaking English as fluently as an American.
I don't like drinking.
Nobody feels optimistic today.
"Just tell us what you want to tell us, then leave."
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Maybe we should talk again tomorrow.
Are my socks dry already?
Help me and I'll help you.
I love Boston.
Did you read it at all?
Do you have a similar saying in Japanese?
I've heard that.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
I recall less and less of my childhood.

Do you know where they are?
Do you want to see Tom again?
It'll take some time to get used to living here.

I placed the medicine out of the children's reach.
She advised him to stay in bed for two more days.
I have a twitch in my right eye.
What're your plans for the weekend?
Could you tell me something about yourself?
Tom read anything he could lay his hands on.
Tom says he's feeling a lot better today.
How can I avoid making the same mistake?
"Babies can become dehydrated from a high fever, so I was told that it would be better to send him to the hospital."
We have to stop this.
"The food wasn't good, but at least it was cheap."
"Is that true, Tom?"
The room was anything but tidy.
It's too soon for that.
Could you please tell me how tall you are and how much you weigh?
You're right in a sense.
Do I look like I'm happy?
"Father can swim, but Mother cannot."
Tom tried to explain his idea to Mary.
I've never heard my mother sing a song.
We need to go back to the drawing board.
I will overlook your lateness this time.
I want you to stay with me.
Roll the dice.
You're in trouble.
Cut it in half.
I'm looking for a bank. Is there one near here?
We have ample food.
Tom decided then and there to never let this happen again.
She should listen more to other people.
I can't do without your advice.
She is a total stranger to me.
What's Tom making?
I know Tom likes me.
Can rabbits swim?
I value your candor.
Do you wanna talk?
She took a long time to choose her hat.
I'm only interested in the truth.
She appears to have many friends.
Don't touch anything without asking.
Tom came running.
I don't play tennis after school.
Ask me what you want to know.
I never could keep a secret.
He had no money.
How long are you planning to stay?
Give me some time to figure out what went wrong.
The United States is a country of immigrants.
I have my own bedroom at home.
You know me better than that.
Nobody encouraged him.
Keep them.
What time does it close?
I'm driving into town so I can drop you off on the way.
Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
I was tempted to call in sick.
Tom gave Mary a watch.
He was angry and confused.
Tom doesn't like speaking French.
Tom was the first to arrive.
Tom said that he doesn't plan to be there.
Go away!
Tom and the other hostages have been released.
Tom's dog followed him into the house.
I came to congratulate you.
I will help.
It is impossible for me to solve the problem.
Tom is painting his room.
Are you going?
This diamond is not real.
Be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.
I'll have to catch the 8:15 train to Paris.
Don't spend all your money on comic books.
Tom had to live with the consequences of his actions.
Tom spoiled the movie for Mary by telling her how it ends.
Tom seemed to know just about everyone.
Tom said you might be interested in this book.
My job is teaching English.
Tell Tom why.
I don't understand you.
Hardly anybody's happy today.
It seemed obvious to me that the plan needed a few revisions.
I don't want to retire yet.
Tom looks shocked.
That is enormous.
This road curves gently to the right.
The gun went off by accident.
It's a big world.
Tom needs to finish what he started.
Tom decided to study law.
Where is the restaurant?
I've got to go now.
The summer vacation is over.
He was acquitted.
I think that recording is important.
Tom is a lot shorter than Mary is.
Tom raises orchids.
Don't kill the messenger.
He is usually straightforward and sincere and thereby gains the confidence of those who meet him.
I have a bad toothache.
That's what Tom gets paid for.
He asked me what was the matter with me.
I also love to cook.
Is that a bus or a car?
"Come on up, Tom."
"After running up the hill, I was completely out of breath."
Tom never got an award.
I already regret it.
Haven't I paid you enough?
Tom is signing documents.
Many Americans opposed the treaty.
I don't know the reason why she isn't coming.
I love you more than he loves you.
I was told to stay on the ship.
Tom had one big ambition in life. That was to become a race car driver.
They didn't change their minds.
Do I look happy to you?
An ant can lift more than 50 times its weight.
It'd be better if you didn't come today.
"I wanted Tom to take some aspirin, but he said he didn't think it would help."
"Even though he was sick, he went to school."
His brother studies very hard.
We have to leave now.
Let's wait for our turn.
I know where they're going.
I am glad to see her.
Do it for me.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
Do you have any children?
Health is the most important thing.
Tom waited half an hour and then left.
It's just the right size.
I am happy that you are my friend.
Tom isn't as smart as he looks.
It's on page 3.
I have no intention of asking him.
"You've got to stop, Tom."
I major in sociology.
What else did you say?
Tom can't put up with Mary's behavior anymore.
How far do we have to go?
I wanted to know if you'd heard anything about what's going to be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.
I borrow books from the library.
I've talked to Tom a couple of times about that already.
Have you ever heard Tom speak French?
I thought it was unusual that he was up so late at night.
I need to talk to Tom.
Does your wife know all this?
Boil those potatoes.
How will you travel to Osaka?
I had him fix my watch.
They know what happened.
These are our books.
That's what they don't understand.
"Tom got to the station too late, so he missed the train."
She asked several question of us.
The potato was so hot that it burned my mouth.
Tom refuses to take orders from Mary.
Do you know how to use a dictionary?
She doesn't like to sing sad songs.
Here's your change.
They saw Tom.
I like to drink milk.
We go fishing from time to time.
Tom keeps the garbage bags under the kitchen sink.
I'm used to getting up early.
Is that too much to ask?
I can't control what happens.
I like women but I don't get along with them.
She married a hotshot lawyer from New York.
You must start at once.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked for.
"As soon as she heard the bell ring, she answered the telephone."
The correspondent filed a report from Moscow.
Don't forget to write the zip code.
He is giving me a hard time.
The tax bill was passed yesterday.
I'm considering studying in the United States next year.
I knew that I could beat Tom.
Did you take Tom's advice?
I left home at seven.
You shouldn't associate with men like that.
What exactly am I paying for?
Tom obeyed.
You will stay at home.
I get paid tomorrow.
I don't need an interpreter.
It's not anybody's fault.
Put down your pencil and listen to me.
Do you have a minute?
Tom skipped class.
Tom doesn't like traveling by plane.
I feel really stupid.
Tom didn't remember to pay his rent.

You'd better go home.

How can I fix my leaky faucet?

This is not a game.

Does Tom have one?
He studied hard.
Don't make an enemy of him.
It's been a pleasure.
This is a comfortable chair.
Can you teach me how to fly?
I hate your guts.
They're new.
It's not necessary to come tomorrow.
The Soviet troops started to withdraw from Afghanistan.
Please bring me a chair from the next room.
Tom put the letter in his coat pocket.
Tom believes that the government wants to hide the truth about aliens.
The sun doesn't shine at night.
Have you ever been abroad?

I've said too much.
How come you aren't taking me?
You've got to be on your toes.
I think I found something.

That's what friends are for.
They can't continue without Tom.

I hope that you'll help me.
The teacher asked me a difficult question.
I didn't know who else to ask.
I've been sentenced to death.
It will get warmer and warmer.
I learned that from you.
Do you like going to school?
You might as well throw your money away as spend it on gambling.
She was afraid of waking the baby.
I bet that I can jump higher than you.
What does your sister do now?
You won't find this book in any bookstore.

No one told me.
What are you going to do next?
She could die.

The bridge is very long and very tall.
Have you answered that letter yet?
His face brightened.
Don't do that again.
Take mine.
She grew up in the harsh environment of New York City.

Don't stay in the sun too long.
Try not to forget anything.
This soup is too thin for me.
Tom doesn't like eating fish.
"Good work, Tom."

Tom ran like a scared rabbit.
He denied knowing anything about it.
Have you ever touched a dolphin?
Tom is divorced.
He suggested a plan similar to mine.
Tom doesn't know for certain when Mary will come.
I'm sad.
I returned the knife that I borrowed.
Could you please just calm down?
Who pays your salary?
She lost her temper with me.
Tom is making us do this.
I'd rather die than do what you're asking me to do.
He arrived too early.
Did you speak at all?
I'm a normal girl.
I think I know you.
Let's play this game again.
Green is my favorite color.
I shouldn't have logged off.
I'm no friend of yours.
Tom was about to get into his car when he was shot.
They say she's sick.
Why won't you talk to me?
Get out of the water.
Do you know what's in that box?
I'm beautiful.
This is what I have to do.
A bunch of people were standing outside waiting.
How many magazines are on the desk?
He's the kind of guy who doesn't take women seriously.
They asked for an increase of salary.
Tom helped Mary move the furniture.
She kicked him hard.
Tom got off his horse.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom thinks there's a good possibility that Mary will agree to babysit the children on Friday night.
What time is it now by your watch?
Don't worry about it.
He was not a man to be disheartened by a single failure.
I gave up smoking a year ago.
Tom is taking swimming lessons.
I need to get a job.
Let's play volleyball.
Get it ready at once.
I don't like doctors.
It's good to see you all again.
At least I tried to do something.
That's our fault.
Have you decided what to do yet?
Tom doesn't have enough experience to operate a train.
We're fighting a losing battle.
The violence lasted for two weeks.
How far is it from the airport to the hotel?
Each of their opinions has both good points and bad points.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.

I was born in Osaka in 1977.
We were rowing against the current.
I have many photos.
Don't you think it's still a little too early to talk to Tom about this?
Tom gave Mary a kick in the ribs.
I can't go home.
Why haven't you told your parents?
Tom borrowed a book from Mary.
I want to study history.
Tom is strikingly good-looking.
Take care of the kids for me.
Is the coffee hot?
Go and see for yourself what has happened.
What is Tom's girlfriend's name?
He ran past without noticing her.
That's one of our rules.
Any time will suit me.
Tom is used to making quick decisions.
Tom is in a bad mood.
Let's begin our work at once.
It's probably just the wind.
Why didn't you say goodbye?
Who's Tom looking for?
She adores cats.
She came out on top.
Do you know what kind of flower that is?
I'm not sure what's wrong. We should have heard from Tom by now.
Tom wondered how tall Mary was.
We braved the elements to walk to the station.
"Today, we're going dancing."
"If you would talk less and listen more, you might learn something."
You're the only one who understands me.
Tom faces a dilemma.
A thorough investigation is now in progress.
He isn't happy at all.
You may borrow this book as long as you keep it clean.
The boy had bad teeth because he neglected to brush them.
"Admit it, Tom, you're still in love with me."
I only drink ice tea.
Tom is very likely to be able to do that.
Are you ready to hear the bad news?
I stayed home all day.
He ran outside naked.
How many times a day should I feed my dog?
What's new?
"The accent of ""guitar"" falls on the second syllable."
I believe I can help you find Tom.
Tom is trying to understand.
I think you did that intentionally.
I tried to talk a friend of mine out of getting married.
We were just about to take a break.
"And then, what did you do?"
You did what you had to do.
That's all we know.
Is this your flight?
I don't wanna go back.
Tom found nothing.
He is proud of never having been beaten in ping-pong.
I'll go and see.
It was my first night among strangers.
Tom was born there.
I had doubts.
This sword has a strange history.
You'll never guess who I just met.
They're insane.
My sister will get married early next year.
I need to blow off some steam.
Tom made himself as comfortable as possible.
I don't want to get divorced.
Take as much or as little as you'd like.
What are you girls doing?
I'm thinking of changing jobs.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
"Not knowing what to say, I kept silent."
Tom put off his departure till Sunday.
I have something you should look at.
You look absolutely gorgeous.
"Running as fast as she could, she still failed to catch the bus."
Why do you say such horrible things about me?
This airplane is capable of carrying 40 passengers at a time.
You're a good person.
Cross out the incorrect words.
Bring Tom inside.
This road will take you to the station.
I hope to see you.
I didn't want you to go away.
What do you do on Sunday?
What school do you go to?
Why didn't you do that?
You should've left while you had the chance.
She didn't show up at the party yesterday.
They're looking for Tom.
Bread and butter is their usual breakfast.
There is nothing to hinder me.
Don't let yourself be used.
How about you?
Kids catch colds easily.
Human relationships are very complex.
Did you forget to bring money?
Tom ate lunch at home.
Tom makes beautiful furniture out of wood.
Nobody wants you to do this.
The wedding will take place next spring.
I think we need to go back to Boston.
I still have my doubts.
"If they had offered you the job, would you have accepted it?"
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
Tom was assessed by the selection committee as fully meeting all criteria for the job.
They talked over a cup of coffee.
You can't turn the heat off as long as the system is operating.
I can't tell you what my plans are.
"If you didn't have him to exchange letters with, you would be lonely."
Tom began to eat lunch.
Be kind to the old.
That was awkward.
Everyone survived.
It was a terrible day.
You look just like your big brother.
I'm angry with her.
All the good seats were already taken.
I think you're on the right track.
A sudden illness forced her to cancel her appointment.
That's a joke.
Have you noticed anything unusual?
You're overreacting.
I didn't let Tom know that I knew how to speak French.
You're afraid of him.
Tom said that he was exhausted.
"I was planning to call him, but changed my mind and didn't."
"Of course, he is right."
You're going to come up against fierce competition.
Bring me some food from the kitchen.
Tom looks excited.
What's that got to do with you?
Let's share the expenses.
Tom goes fishing quite often.
"Bring me today's paper, please."
I will send your teacher a note to excuse your absence.
He succeeded in business.
Tom appears confused.
There's a problem I have to talk to you about.
You're not going to get any more help from me.

She's a single mother.
Do you think we'll ever find a way to do that?

He's accustomed to mountain climbing.
Tom started a bar fight.
Nobody believes me.
I wouldn't bet on that if I were you.
Tom never breaks promises.
Suddenly it began to rain.
Tom left.
He is the tallest of the three.
Tom is using the Internet to learn Spanish.
"If you see or hear anything, let me know."
Somebody could be watching us.
This is deeply disturbing.
It is not good to laugh at others.
He climbed over the fence.
Tom isn't welcome here.
Your parents can't keep us apart forever.
How much will it cost?
Have you ever ridden a mule?
Galileo argued that the earth moves.
Why don't you both come over for dinner?
Put it on my bill.
I am sick and tired of him.
True friendship is priceless.
Tom often tells us jokes.
What time do you start check-in?
Have you heard whether Tom got the job?
"From now on, you're one of us."
I slept twelve hours yesterday.
Tom refused to eat his lunch.
Could you lend me your bike?

She is buying books in the bookstore.
The work was all but finished.
You should wash your hands before you eat.
I need new shoes.
I'm glad I got here on time.
We love our children.
Tom's will is going to be read tomorrow at 2:30.
You should wash your hair.
We love coffee.
What I told you yesterday wasn't true.
I'm a Japanese teacher.
It was foolish for him to turn down her offer.
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.
There's a possibility that she'll succeed.
We've already met.
"You have friends who can help you, don't you?"
"The sooner you clear the matter up with Tom, the better."
I want to be able to read French.
I thought you might back out.
We've recently put a new roof on our house.
This phenomenon is very easy to explain.
The door was locked and we couldn't get in.
I'll give you a good price.
Please help yourself.
Tom didn't know what to do first.
He is not honest at all.
Does Tom wear shoes indoors?
You forgot to turn off the light.
"If you think that this is going to be easy, you're wrong."
Do you know where Tom has to go?
Do you want me to take care of that matter?
Go get your helmet.
You seem to have hurt yourself.
Something's really weird here.
Is there still any sugar?
I'm a good taxi driver.
In Japan a new school year starts in April.
I've never had to work very hard.
Tom will never understand why we want him to do this.
There also was another reason.
My mother cut my hair too short.
Tom will catch us.
They've increased the salaries.
I can easily touch my toes.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
Do you have any idea who could be behind this?
Don't forget your umbrella.
His story was published in a magazine.
Tom refused to forgive Mary.
Why does this lizard have five legs?
"The other day, I bought a camera."
I'm very happy for Tom.
I can't make decisions by myself.
I have been waiting for a long time.
I'm a hero.
Promise me you won't laugh.
Do you speak Bulgarian?
I must get off at the next station.
Tom says he's working very hard.
You should be happy for Tom.
It's just over there.
What's your phone number?
She might come tomorrow.
I've caught a terrible cold.
The kitten rolled the yarn across the floor.
I told you to stop calling me that.
You keep out of this.
This is very simple.
You may take the book.
You worked hard.
I don't know where that came from.
Why can't you come?
Don't spend so much time watching TV.
I want to lose weight.
He has been in Japan for two years.
I'll put that on my to-do list.
Your efforts will soon pay off.
She looks confused.
I'll show you how to catch fish.
I knew I'd find you here.
She is friendly to everybody.
I don't think Tom lives here.
Go ahead and ask Tom.
Tom is rich.
She seldom goes out.
"Tom is very good at sports, but not very good at school."
She is a very intelligent young lady.
We spent our holiday at the seaside.
Would you please turn on the air conditioner?
Many people are upset.
I want to take care of Tom personally.
Is eating healthy more expensive?
Tom gave some milk to the cat.
I have already washed the dishes.
"That one's for me, too."
I need you to do a couple of things for me.
Do we have time?
Tom should work harder.
"You can swim, but I can't."
She's unfit for the job.
Everyone's different.
Tom is more experienced than me.
Tom wasn't happy about the situation.
How can I contact Tom?
Tom never jokes about his job.
I should've told Tom.
I'm sure he'll pass the upcoming exam.
It appears to me that you are right.
He has this large room to himself.
My dog needs a walk.
I really thought Tom was happy.
What's wrong with this?
"Can you help me, please?"
Let's talk shop for a while.
I never saw him again.
Does she play piano?
I'm not going to go to Boston with Tom.
The problem is too difficult to solve.
Tom is crying because he got stung by a bee.
Tom is slightly tipsy.
My grandmother lives by herself.
Keep that.
We're not afraid.
Children need loving.
There is a better way.
I'll think about that.
We are a family.
Your stupid plan is actually working.
It rains a lot during February here in Brazil.
Tom never dreamed that Mary would ever leave him.
The population of Japan is about 120 million.
She's a belly dancer.
Tom was a little drunk.
Humans were never meant to live forever.
This is disturbing.
I need to let Tom know.
I got the idea that he would come by himself.
I saw him go out.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I like the arrangement of the furniture in this room.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Tom saw it.
Tom needed assistance.
Is Tom in pain?
Why did you leave the light on in the meeting room?
How many times have you made the trip by boat?
"They are leaving in three days, that is to say June 10th."
It made me forget about my problems.
Will you go in place of me?
She felt like crying when she heard the news.
We know very little about it.
I'm terrible at chess.
It was quite dark when I got there.
I'm not a poet.
When did you change your address?
War is hell.
What time are you getting up?
Keep away from the fire.
The two brothers are very much alike.
I never want to owe money to anyone.
The ship is bound for Finland.
Tom was talkative.
I have an Italian neighbor.
The money came like manna from heaven.
I had no idea what to do.
My house is on a hill.
The boy considered the dolphin his best friend.
Tom looks sick.
Everything's OK.
I think Tom is correct.
Can you guess my age?
I can't show you this.
Do you know where my recipe book is?
My son is now as tall as I am.
I will show you my new car.
"If it hadn't been for his help, she might have drowned."
These glasses are beautiful.
Tom is a very fast swimmer.
They talked on the phone every night.
Could you go and see if Tom is OK?
I don't like to go outside when it's raining.
She's a determined woman.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere.
Are you content?
Tom took off his glasses and closed his eyes.
You can't see my house from here.
My life was a wreck.
Don't worry about the baby.
Tom ran away.
"Well, what was I supposed to say?"
I'm a bit groggy.
"If the alarm rings, walk, don't run."
"Today it's very sunny, so everyone is wearing sunglasses."
Tom and Mary want a big family.
"If you're going to go to France, you should brush up your French."
You don't need to worry about Tom anymore.
We have been married for three years.
I don't have a computer.
It isn't as if we were rich.
Do you know if Tom is here?
Tom is out for the day.
All the floors in her house are made of wood.
Can you take over the driving for a while?
I have a big favor to ask.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
Do you know where he went?
We have to find it before Tom does.
Tom usually listens to classical music.
"You don't believe Tom, do you?"
Who talked?
They are impatient.
She will have a child next month.
Tom has three secretaries.
Get a grip on yourself!
Tom became a Republican.
Have you ever built a house?
I like how you think.
People from all around the world attended to his funeral.
Have you been abroad?
Tom and Mary often help each other.
They'd like that.
"Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you."
"In all of my travels, I have never seen a more beautiful mountain than Mount Everest."
Tom was real happy.
"It doesn't cost anything, but it takes time."
Who's not busy?
You won't be shot.
I couldn't have done it without your help.
This story cannot be true.
Everyone has a right to say what he thinks.
Are you still upset?
Would you like a room with a bath or a shower?
What do I get in return?
Where can I go to get a map of Europe?
I've never seen so many trees in my life.
Get under my umbrella.
Tom says he has a secret weapon.
He amazed everyone by passing his driving test.
Let's hope Tom will have the sense to do that.
Frayed electrical cables can be very dangerous.
You must not go up the stairs.
Tell me how to solve the problem.
Tom looks like he's thinking.
You're impatient.
This doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
She isn't fit for the job.
I had a dream about you last night.
I take a walk every day except when it rains.
It is no use trying to argue with him.
I can do that.
How's Tom's cold?
I'm shocked.
Not many survive this disease.
I would like to know how these substances are absorbed by the body.
I love cooking for you.
We appointed him as our representative.
He had difficulty in finding his way to the hotel.
I'm a cancer patient.
My hobby is fishing.
She's got more books.
Tom said that Mary may do that.
I told Tom that I didn't like him.
I really want to meet Tom.
How long do you plan to stay?
I left my cell phone at home.
He cannot stop her.
I'm not in love with Mary.
How can it be done?
Are you always at home in the evening?
Tom has been taking walks at night.
We usually sleep in this room.
My New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the ocarina.
I am 18 years old.
This is how you get results.
I'll get off here.
She's married to a dentist.
I can teach you how to steal.
I will go if you go.
Who wouldn't want to go out with Mary?
Do you have a home in Italy?
These shoes are too tight.
Tom bought two copies of the book.
Even Tom knew that.
Tom renamed the folder.
Tom is changing his clothes.
The apples which he sent to me were delicious.
I need a favor.
I cannot lend this book to you.
Tom is no longer afraid.
Does anybody here have a bottle opener?
Leave a message.
I wonder why Tom studied French.
We'll do great.
Tom always leaves everything to the last minute.
What crime did you commit?
Add more water to it.
Do you wear glasses?
Do you want a glass of water?
Are you being serious?
I think Tom told Mary about what we did last summer.
The boy gathered a handful of peanuts and put them in a small box.
Did you ever call Tom?
Tom always has a backup plan.
You came just in time.
Tom nearly died of embarrassment.
I think that's a good sign.
Let's go to eat together.
You can't just not show up.
We couldn't row against the strong current.
Tom's car broke down.
I like this coat. May I try it on?
I'm getting off at the next station.
"They aren't quarreling, but are rehearsing a play."
Tom didn't say where he had been.
What do you and Tom want to do?
We must cancel our trip to Japan.
We have lunch at about noon.
She is now making coffee in the kitchen.
When was the last time you ate out?
I am highly honored by the presence of the president.
"What Tom said was true at the time he said it, but it isn't true anymore."
I want you here tomorrow by 2:30.
I didn't know why I wasn't supposed to visit that part of the city.
I spent all night working on this report.
The man is checking in at a hotel.
I need to see you in my office.
Her name is Mary.
Tom is not far off the mark.
Would you like to share my dessert with me?
Tom is a slow eater.
Tom is watching.
There's nothing I could ever say that would make Tom change his mind.
I'm not in that much of a hurry.
Is it snowing?
The thief got in without being noticed.
The noise distracted him from studying.
You had better tell me now.
They're about to go.
I became less and less interested in mathematics.
They insulted him and his wife.
Your selfishness will lose you your friends.
He fed his dog at the same time every day.
Does Tom know that you like him?
Suddenly all the lights went out.
I know what I'd do.
I have three times as many books as him.
Michael Jackson has died.
He can't sing.
I can't detect any pattern.
How do you make a living?
Tom doesn't understand.
Tom asked me if I knew how to get to Mary's house.
I locked myself out of my apartment.
Tom ripped open the envelope.
"This book is easy to read, since it's written in simple English."
I applied for a summer internship.
My mother loves music.
Tom hopes you'll like it.
Who saw you?
I feel very betrayed.
He's stupid and irrational.
How does Tom get to school?
Tom refused to let Mary in.
They are singers.
How do you turn off this light?
He walks in the park every morning.
The sky is clear almost every day.
There are holes in the roof.
Could you please hurry?
I don't know why.
Why did you do something stupid like that?
Tom appears disoriented.
Tom and Mary ate the whole cake by themselves.
I see you've been shopping again.
Mary makes more money than her husband.
The cat clung to her dress.
We should give Tom a raise.
I had no idea you were a surgeon.
I'd be willing to pay you.
You must do it.
What color is your hair?
I stayed in Boston for three years.
You haven't changed and you never will.
Her son has her eyes.
Tom seemed to be a little drunk.
"For dinner, we went back to my place."
Somebody's at the door.
Your question is hard to answer.
"On a clear day, you can see Mt. Fuji."
Thunderstorms are both scary and exciting.
The installation is now complete.
I want to rent an apartment with two rooms.
"Since there are rice paddies near my house, I often hear frogs croaking all night long this time of year."
Which is your bag?
It was not so simple to write a letter in English.
I don't understand what she wants me to do.
Tom was here a while ago.
Don't trample on the grass.
I just made a fresh pot of coffee.
Don't worry about such a trivial problem.
Perhaps you'd better leave.
I hope Tom remembered to shave.
How long are they?
Tom is a glassblower.
Tom burned his tongue on the hot soup.
Your anger is completely justified.
The situation has changed.
Tom begged Mary to forgive him.
What exactly is it that you want me to say?
I like my steak rare.
I still think about her from time to time.
The train was thirty minutes late.
Add more salt to the soup.
We're just friends.
Do you really want to have kids?
I know a shortcut.
Tom and Mary have lived in this neighborhood for a long time.
Is Tom one of the finalists?
It's time to establish the religion of love.
He won't come to class tomorrow.
I'm as hungry as a bear.
He took a step forward.
I couldn't hear Tom.
"Even standing right in front of the stove, Tom still felt cold."
I am eating a banana.
"We need to invest in clean, renewable energy."
"People, goods and money are all free to move across national borders in the region."
I wish I had a beautiful girlfriend.
He cut the apple in half.
You are what you eat.
I can't believe you still trust Tom.
Shouldn't we be going soon?
They sat down by the fire.
You may enter.
I'll drive you home.
I told Tom that I was busy.
I have to clean up my apartment.
I've decided to study kanji.
I'm wondering what'll happen if I push this button.
This noise is driving me crazy.
Things would never be the same.
"Tom has a car, doesn't he?"
Tom insisted it never happened.
We're the first ones to arrive.
He looked up the word in the dictionary.
"If it had not been for his timely hit, our team would have lost the game."
Man is the only animal that can laugh.
Tom doesn't usually wear pajamas.
They're not going to stop you.
You could've stayed in Boston.
Tom is very brave.
Perhaps you'd better drive.
Odette was born in Nantes in 1905.
Do you want to see it again?
Tom dabbled in magic.
Please drive carefully.
Don't you have something to do?
That was the first time I was ever alone with Tom.
"Can I take photographs here? ""Only outside."""
I think telling lies is wrong.
Don't get up.
He has been studying French for eight years.
Do you like cooking?
You have real potential.
Tom and Mary became lifelong friends.
I was ready for Tom.
He wears pajamas.
Promise me you won't do that again.
Tom dressed well.
Who's your dad?
This mobile phone is really expensive.
You're a real friend.
I can't eat all that by myself.
I tried to get good marks.
"In Haiti, there was a large earthquake."
I am free till 6 o'clock this evening.
He quickly went out of the room.
The morning is just a few hours away.
Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa as far away from each other as possible.
"Tom gave a famous singer ten thousand dollars to come to the restaurant to sing ""Happy Birthday."""
I put my hand on his shoulder.
Why doesn't he tell the truth?
Tom fell off his horse.
I have to delete many files from my computer.
You are not a coward.
We went camping near the river.
Nobody has seen the bird fly.
I'm a friend.
Why don't you stop it?
I just want to hug you.
His accent suggests he is a foreigner.
"If anything happens, let me know."
Tom found one.
I love to see you smile.
You might want to ask Tom to help you.
Did you pass your math exam?
I must leave early tomorrow.
Tom is after me.
You look good in that suit.
Are we all ready?
Tom opened the window even though his mother told him not to.
Please circle the right answer.
What is the highest mountain in North America?
You're the dreamer.
We can't open this envelope until Tom gets here.
Who do you think I am?
I can't believe you’re doing this to me.
What'll happen?
There is no use waiting for her any longer.
They ate healthier foods.
This was a premeditated crime.
Tom has work to do.
How old do you think she is?
Tom is a corrections officer.
Children are full of energy.
Tom earns about $300 a month working part time.
Are you accusing me of being a liar?
Read the note at the bottom of the page.
I spend a lot of time practicing the guitar.
You're wanted on the telephone.
I'd like to know Tom's whereabouts.
The dentist put in a temporary filling.
It's midnight.
I like red roses.
I saw him wash the car.
I'll call you back later.
You know this is a mistake.
I'm surprised that he accepted the offer.
The man was given a life sentence.
The city hall is in the center of the city.
There's something the matter with my car.
He was killed in an airplane accident.
She weeded the garden.
Stay in touch with the most important people in your life.
May I go home?
My big brother shared his cake with me.
Are you sure that Tom is Mary's boyfriend?
"Tom said that he thought it could happen in Boston, too."
Tom and I discussed the problem with each other.
I was a healthy child.
Where is this train going?
I don't have the faintest idea.
Don't tempt me. I might just do that.
I'd like to be alone.
Tom's busy.
How exactly do you do that?
We mustn't let this news get out.
Tom inherited his farm from his father.
We have a medical emergency.
I can't go to Australia with you.
You can make your own.
This makes me so mad.
Lithuania is a member of the European Union.
Put the book back on the shelf when you're through with it.
I have no homework today.
It's tough to explain.
The sky became darker and darker.
"Say Tom, what's wrong?"
"To our great surprise, he suddenly resigned."
"Laughter is like a windshield wiper. It can't stop the rain, but it lets you move ahead."
Part of the town was destroyed by the fires.
I stayed home because I had a bad cold.
Tom put on his helmet and got on his bike.
Such was his pride that he could not bring himself to ignore the insult.
"If two people have the same opinion, one of them is redundant."
No one knows that I like you.
Aren't we going do that?
My brother has just come home from Kobe.
You can't lose what you don't have.
They've been keeping something from me.
Tom enjoys movies.
My eyes are watering.
This place is weird.
Do you have my book?
Tom could've done that without your help.
Now I feel sorry for her.
Tom is a snotty little brat.
Tom and Mary are fun to be around.
He pretended to be a doctor.
Three years sounds like a long time.
How many photos are in this album?
Tom doesn't like this one bit.
"What time, exactly, did Tom leave?"
I made an abstract of a book.
Tom has been very kind to us.
Tom is still a young guy.
Would you mind if I open the window?
I have no idea what to wear.
I thought Tom already knew about that.
Three years ago something like this never would have happened.
Tom put Mary on hold.
I'm a father.
Tom is our client.
It sure is windy today.
Now you've hurt my feelings.
Why don't we go out?
I can't tell a frog from a toad.
I can't explain how it is.
Tom put the pan in the sink.
Her husband is American.
Tom is a telepath.
That sounds awesome.
Nobody talked about the movie.
Are you still living in Boston?
Tom can't afford that kind of computer.
I nearly had a heart attack.
Yanis hasn't arrived yet.
"As we age, our ability to remember gets worse."
"To the best of my knowledge, this chemical will prevent germs from breeding."
I forgot my wife's birthday.
It is merely an imitation pearl.
I'm not even sure if that would help or not.
Let Tom finish what he started.
Did Tom say why he wanted to quit?
The continent is abundant in fossil fuels.
Tom has a lot of patience.
That was fun.
"If the medicine isn't working, maybe we should up the dosage."
We'd like to know about it.
Why did you choose to sing that song?
I am familiar with this part of town.
Has the bell rung?
Tom has only been pretending that he doesn't understand French.
Where's your boyfriend?
I took an arrow in the knee.
Hold on to me.
I'd like to hear exactly how Tom managed to get that old car running again.
I am fat.
You're very sweet.
"Remember your promise, Tom."
Mary is a retired nurse.
Tom wants to meet you.
She needs to sleep more.
Did you say thank you?
I had hardly sat down on the bench when I found it had just been painted.
Tom was adamant.
The sky is clear almost every day.
Tom told Mary the secret.
Hunting season is over.
We grind our coffee by hand.
We are apt to make mistakes.
I've been thinking about getting a dog.
We're joking.
She lives in this house by herself.
Do you think our team will win?
Do you mind if I turn down the TV?
Where did you buy that?
I watched a movie on video.
I have a stomachache.
Have I answered your question?
Kendo is a martial art.
I want you to drive to Boston.
I've heard this song before.
I just wasted three hours trying to get this thing fixed.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I come from Brazil.
"They live in a little, rustic house out in the woods."
I believe that Tom loves me.
You know what you must do.
"Next time, you should buy a larger size."
I closed my eyes to calm down.
"You couldn't solve the problem, could you?"
They're not coming.
Tom delivers newspapers.
Autumn changed into winter.
He probably won't come.
He should have bought some pencils.
I have some pens.
What kind of music do you listen to?
I am afraid he is going to spill the beans.
Where is the bus stop?
I've never heard my mother sing.
Please say something.
We're not going in there.
I have not heard from him for a long time.
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
I think I'm crazy.
He's intelligent.
You'll suffer because of that.
I need the money.
"You always talk back to me, don't you?"
The boy feared the dark.
What does that sign say?
I have read this book before.
I suggest we get away from here as soon as possible.
Follow behind me.
We don't have a lot of time.
Tom doesn't know the reason why Mary went to Boston.
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
Perhaps it's Tom.
You've got bags under your eyes.
That's not how the world works.
Tom is checking his mailbox.
Tom ate the orange without peeling it first.
I expect I'll have to do that for Tom.
Do everything at your own risk.
Was anybody killed?
We can't save everybody.
Tom always carries a camera with him wherever he goes.
How many people do you think die from cancer every year?
She couldn't look him in the face.
You're welcome to join me.
I knew you'd get here in time.
I can't take that risk.
I want you to meet my cousin.
Tom seated himself.
That's a tree.
What was it you wanted to ask me to do?
Do you think I should tell Tom everything?
Maybe Tom went shopping with Mary.
Tom is doing great in school.
Drive carefully.
Why didn't you buy any coffee?
They enjoy one another's company.
Can you measure the length?
Tom was sent to Coventry.
She cursed loudly.
He treats me as if I am a stranger.
"I'll miss Tom, too."
She always speaks ill of others.
Not everyone who is nice to you is your friend.
Tom isn't answering.
You can't blame this on us.
"Sadly, many Japanese people died."
We must water the flower.
I didn't think the American people would reelect George W. Bush.
He holds a senior position in the government.
Tom said that Mary had a cold.
Tom is Mary's stepson.
She refused his offer.
I solved the problem in this way.
Not all of these eggs are fresh.
I hate hypocrisy.
Do you really think that your plans are realistic?
Tom can't retire.
We lost sight of her in the crowd.
Tom nearly died.
I wonder if the weather will hold.
You're powerless.
Thanks for the drink.
The news made her very sad.
This news is important to us.
Tom and Mary had the same idea.
He attended the meeting in my place.
"Well done, Tom."
This book is especially difficult to read.
Were you happy with the results?
It's not so bad here.
How in the world did you find me?
What should I do about Tom?
It wouldn't make any difference.
She tried to kill herself.
We'll cooperate.
This store doesn't stay open as late as I'd like.
They called.
We have to be willing to take the first step.
Learning should not be forced. Learning should be encouraged.
I got off lightly.
You are expected to pass the exam.
He described the incident in detail.
Yesterday they fired seven employees.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat that.
Don't think that I'm going to let you get away.
Tom can do it better than me.
Pack your bags. You're fired.
I love your daughter.
I didn't expect you.
Do you know what to do with this?
We have to take the stairs.
I don't understand why Tom has to do that.
There was a really cute girl on the train.
Have patience for another day or two.
I have to do my homework.
Tom is a successful lawyer.
She was so scared that she couldn't speak.
"What made Tom mad wasn't what you said, but the way you said it."
"Is he coming? ""No, I don't think so."""
Tom is disturbed.
Your gums are in bad shape.
The world is full of incompetent doctors.
"Whenever I hear this song, I think of his smile."
I'll do whatever I have to do.
Have you ever thought of becoming a nurse?
I want you to leave us alone.
Science has not solved all the problems of life.
Why didn't you tell me?
I feed my cat every morning and every evening.
Where exactly did you put it?
At last he attained his goal.
This sentence is in the present tense.
How do I stop Tom?
Why don't you like it here?
Tom is afraid of spiders.
What advice did Tom give you?
Where did I put it?
He denied everything.
Don't be upset.
The rules apply to everyone.
It was terribly cold yesterday.
Write to me.
Tom and Mary aren't getting married.
He's studying now.
It's not worth the effort.
Tom has decided to keep a diary this year.
Is this seat open?
I wish you wouldn't smoke so much.
How hard is it to learn to read music?
"Will you call me a taxi, please?"
What kind of music do you like?
Can I speak with Tom?
I will do everything in my power to help.
Go to your room and think about what you did.
Nobody can understand him.
Is this a compliment?
I have to unpack my suitcase.
You should tell him the truth.
I guess I'd better get back to work.
I ate a lot of pizza.
I wonder whether Tom would mind babysitting our kids tomorrow night.
"The higher we went, the colder it became."
My brother is stronger than me.
"Eventually, someone is going to have to tell Tom that he needs to behave himself."
Everyone in my family is happy.
I was moved.
I should've done this months ago.
She stretched out her legs.
Are you mad at me?
You don't have to do what Tom says.
Where do dreams come from?
Tom told me that he wasn't scared of snakes.
Iron is a useful metal.
Did you catch the train?
We can't help that.
She told a white lie out of necessity.
Almost no one believed him.
We have to stop.
Do you want to get married?
I want you to stay here until I come back.
I can assure you everything has been taken care of.
Tom painted the wall white.
"Now, don't panic."
Tom gave Mary a fist bump.
I spent all day in the library.
He wrung out the dish towel and hung it up to dry.
He began buying gold in huge amounts.
He said that he was hungry.
Sound travels very quickly.
Could you please get the jar of peanut butter from the top shelf for me?
Tom shot me in the leg.
Would you please stop pacing around like that and just sit down for a second?
Give me three more apples.
I already spoke to Tom.
My cat is hungry.
My husband is a very good cook.
I'm afraid I can't make it at that time.
Cherries are ripe in June or July.
What time do you have a break?
I don't see how Tom can stay up all night and then be so wide awake at work.
Tom offered his help to us.
Let's walk a little faster.
That shouldn't have been allowed.
The coffee is very hot.
Take this to your mother.
I'd like to be a millionaire.
"No matter how bad it gets, she won't die from that disease."
Life is very short.
We were just talking about you when you called.
We have to leave now.
Are there any good restaurants around here?
It was a question none of us could answer.
He seems to have no sense of humor.
Tom watched a Japanese movie subtitled in French.
Was Tom with Mary?
Pizza is my favorite food.
Give it back to me!
He began to run.
"Tom has a speech impediment, which gets worse if he has to speak in public."
Why are you doing this to yourself?
How do you know all these things?
Tom was convinced that Mary no longer loved him.
What a cute girl!
I had my personal computer repaired.
Put the car into the garage.
Tom is good at rugby.
When was the last time you had a bath?
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
I have been in Kobe since 1980.
Tom is being bullied by Mary.
This is a picture.
Who told you I was talking about you?
He will travel abroad next year.
I'll never see Tom again.
Very little is known about them.
Why on earth do you want to know that?
You really are very sweet sometimes.
Tom wondered what was on Mary's mind.
Are you sure we've never met before?
Where is your money?
What's wrong?
You can't do that anymore.
"Excuse me, is Tom here today?"
You have cancer.
It's not a coincidence.
The teacher told us that we couldn't eat in the classroom.
Tom unpacked his suitcase.
I'll stay here till you get back.
I'm a tennis player.
What book did you buy?
I don't like doctors.
It's never going to happen.
Next time I'll come earlier.
What's in that cupboard?
He doesn't love me.
"You can dance, can't you?"
Next time it will be my turn to drive.
A solution must be found.
What's your favorite cold weather drink?
I'm grateful to you for your help.
Are you going to record today's episode?
I'll be able to help you.
That's not what I heard.
She has flowers in her hand.
What is this animal called in Japanese?
The teacher will illustrate how to do it.
Tom was pulled over by the police.
I don't understand what you find so interesting about squirrels.
Tom talks a lot.
He quarrelled with his brother.
I'll kill him.
Which one of these boys will you give the book to?
My aunt dropped in on me yesterday.
We may never know what happened to Tom.
You'd better change your eating habits.
What is a think tank?
What did you expect?
"Although my car is very old, it still runs very well."
I don't study math as hard as English.
The teacher gathered his students around him.
I play the piano a little.
They talked over the plan for hours.
His life is in danger.
Tom jogs three times a week.
I just want Tom to get well.
Get them out of the way.
Tom is nothing but trouble.
I don't like your friends. They're always complaining.
I can't even see the other ship in this fog.
"By chance, I met her in the street."
I'm very popular.
She uttered a scream of terror.
Tom isn't afraid of death.
Dinner is ready to eat.
Tom is too drunk to be of much help.
Tom slowly walked up the stairs.
What a thought!
Don't worry about the baby.
Lincoln was elected President in 1860.
This tastes like tea.
He works hard to earn his living.
I think you're the woman I've been waiting for all my life.
Tom believes in reincarnation.
You need therapy.
Did Tom ever mention a Canadian named Mary?
Nothing is what it seems.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
"By the time we got there, he had left."
They have had no rain in Africa for more than a month.
He couldn't carry out his first plan.
I watched him cross the street.
He drives a pickup truck.
The house is haunted.
What does this hat remind you of?
When are you coming back to the office?
I don't have a dependable car.
I think Mary is the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I need a light coat.
He fell asleep while reading a book.
He always goes to work at 8:00 a.m.
A burnt child fears the fire.
Tom is busy making breakfast for the family.
It doesn't work that way.
Don't make noise.
"Because of the heavy fog, we could barely see the road in front of us."
"At school, Tom ignored me and pretended that he didn't know me."
They plan to get married tomorrow.
I am going to Osaka station.

He works for a bank.
I was there the other day.
He was a pioneer in this field.
Voice of America broadcasts from Washington.
Was anybody else hurt?
The moon is out.

Tom can get it.
Tom is different from other boys.
They caught a lot of fish at the river.
Mary wants to become a vet because she loves animals.
The guards searched Tom's cell.
Are they Japanese or Chinese?
He has to get up immediately.
He hanged himself.
The price has gone up.
Tom does 100 sit-ups every morning before breakfast.
We made it out of there.
This bed is too hard to sleep on.
You'll be OK here.
Do you have any idea who did it?
I do not care for him.
Mary didn't even let Tom kiss her.
I want a hot shower before I go back to work.
We entered into a serious conversation.
She always speaks English.
Don't cross this bridge.
It's naive of you to believe that.
Isn't this flower beautiful?
Tom felt like the luckiest man on earth.
He was sharpening a knife.
Tom gathered sticks for the fire.
We'll protect each other.
She did not decide to be a singer until she reached the age of twenty.

Tom replied in the negative.
It was believed that the earth was flat.
Tom has had plenty of time.
Don't you think this computer game may be a little too difficult for Tom?
We trusted each other.
He has made me what I am today.
Tom lives a sheltered life.
I've been playing chess since I was a kid.
I feel homesick.
Tom could've left early if he'd wanted to.
I wonder what they have in common.
Tom could barely make ends meet when he was in his early twenties.
Do you understand her?
I hate Tom.
This is a dangerous mission.
The scientists analyzed the data they had gathered.
He obviously lied.
Can you tell silver and tin apart?

Tom saw Mary kissing John.
Tom found that.
I don't have time to be sick.
He's always broke at the end of the month.
Tom was buried Monday.
What do you think about that?
I have to study for a biology test.
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
They fell into the conversation immediately.
He knows how to tell jokes.
His unique perspective helped shed light on the situation.
We regard him as our hero.
Tom said he enjoyed it.
You've got my computer and I want it back.
Didn't I tell you to take out the garbage?
The professor seemed to be lost in thought.
How do you like these poems?
Tom says I shouldn't do that.
I got shampoo in my eyes.
Mary is more intelligent than her sister.
What are you doing there?
Tom has a sister about your age.
I know where Tom is.
Never ask a question if you aren't prepared to hear the answer.
The picture is on the wall now.
I don't want to give them any reason to think I'm not willing to do my job.
Tom wasn't always this way.
When do you intend to start?
Let's organize a search party.
He lives far away from his hometown.
We have fish for dinner today.
Tom died in a tragic accident.

We're students.
The doctor advised me to drink more milk.
We drove for miles.
Tom's passport has expired.
They checked the machine for defects.
Could you use my help?

Someday she'll have to pay for what she's done.
We didn't say anything.

She doesn't know how to drive a car.
Tom also speaks a little French.
I can't do it without you.
Don't waste your time and money.
The temperature went down to minus ten degrees centigrade last night.
Pay very close attention.
I am sorry to have kept you waiting.

That picture brought back a lot of memories.

Tom opened up the crate with a crowbar and took out a stick of dynamite.
Where did you get this beautiful dress?
That's a waste of money.
Did you know that rotten eggs float?
We were never meant for each other.

She likes taking pictures.

Just act as if nothing has happened.
What you have said applies only to single women.
May I apply for asylum?
Nowadays there are no ninjas or samurais in Japan.
He may come today.
"Yesterday, I bought a book."
Are you sure that's necessary?
I think that's great.
I'm helping Tom.
I had a toothache yesterday.
It's because of you that we were late.
I will get it for you.
Have you ever left your office open?
Tom was up until about 3:00 a.m. reading a book.
You know more than I do about German customs and traditions.
She fell in love with him.
"Tom stepped forward to kiss Mary, but she stepped back."
I've wanted this CD player for a long time.
I'm an artist.

Why didn't you call me sooner?
She looked sadly at me.
It's a new day.
I usually eat meat once a day.
Is that fun?
I think he's right.

We haven't had much rain this year.
Bring it here.
Are you planning on buying a car?

He thinks of nothing but himself.
Do you still drink your coffee black?
I went to a concert with Tom.
"If you have pain, take a painkiller."
Tom is quiet now.
Put some clothes on.
Tom glared at Mary with hatred and disgust.
You're lucky you didn't get shot.
What did Tom write?
The chairman opened the meeting.
They had only one child.
I read one of his works.
Tom doesn't like the way Mary talks.
You can't go in there yet.
Tom was wearing glasses.
He is skating.
I'll give you five minutes to work out this problem.
I don't think he is sincere.
I feel so cold.
The ambassador has returned.
Tom wasn't drunk.
My father was about to leave when the phone rang.
He speaks English with a strong German accent.
Are you in there?
I don't have any clean clothes to wear.
Do you speak Latin?
We've been here for a while.
I don't care what color your skin is.
Tom is no expert.
He kept quiet while we were talking.
The girl who is dressed in white is my fiancée.
"When I heard the news on the radio, a chill ran down my spine."
Don't be late to school again.
It's good to try new things once in a while.
Our team made thirty points in the first half of the game.
I understand.
You simply don't understand.
I thought you'd say that.
Did anybody else see it?
I can sleep a lot better now.
He was robbed of his youth.
Tom is a very shy guy.
"I'm tired, but I'll study hard."
She ought to be at the office by now.
That was to be expected.
Tom sat down on the floor next to Mary.
They know something we don't.
Tom likes raw carrots.
You must promise not to tell anyone.
Don't disturb Tom.
Tom didn't like his name.
Tom never came home.
What books did you buy?
You're not supposed to be here.
I can't get the lid off.

Words cannot convey my feelings.
I don't ever want to speak to Tom again.
Cats don't like to get wet.
She lives in Kyoto.
We need to leave.
We were told by him to leave the room at once.
I feel happiest when I am at home with my family.
Sorry to be late.
I kept asking myself why I'm doing this.
Who's your favorite actor?
I didn't mean to offend Tom.
I thought you might come.
Have you read this?
How was lunch?
I can't lift my right arm.
I have it with me.
What did Tom want?
"If you don't believe me, ask Tom."
Tom's joke went over Mary's head.
Where do these come from?
Tom looked again.
I'm not free.
Tom peeked in the window and saw Mary and John kissing.
Pride comes before a fall.
I hoped to have finished it by this week.

Why are you crying?
We'll see.

She picked him up at the station.
"That is not an orange, either."
The train arrived at Osaka station.
Tom'll go.
Tom and Mary are happy.
I want to find true love.
Who were you there with?
Are you talking to yourself?
My pet dog was seriously ill.
We have little money available for the research.
The situation is critical.
Follow that car.

How are your parents doing?
I saw a whale tail today.
I got married 8 years ago.
I explained the rules of the game to them.
Chance led to the discovery of the new island.
I didn't understand your question.
Put down the hammer.
Tom is going to pick me up at the station.
You will never know where he is.
Those books were on display in the window.
I only have one thing left to do.
"This is a sentence, that has the syllable count, of a haiku."
Tom can't believe that Mary thinks it's OK to let John take the blame.
He gets a high salary.
You shouldn't play with knives.
I eat here all the time.
Don't you want to know?
I'm happy to hear that.
I don't think they would've done anything.
She left for Paris.
We all just want to be loved.
What are you doing here so late at night?
They seem to be conscious of the fact.
I don't like beer.
The students often copy each other's homework.
I don't care.
The game will be played rain or shine.
I have some good news to share.
Are you off duty tonight?
Your timing is perfect.
Everything else is boring.
His sleeve touched the greasy pan.
Bring your brother with you.
Please let me pay.
I was wrong about you.
That made me cry.
We are all in grave danger.
"Tom was a kind and gentle man, well loved by all who knew him."
The United States is the largest producer of cheese in the world.
He was expected to make a decision.
You had better not sit up so late.
Are you speaking to me?
"He may be clever, but he is not very helpful."
Not everyone in town likes you.
Tom is stark naked.
I can't tell you how many times I've thought about all the good times we used to have together.
That has something to do with this problem.
We still don't know the truth.
I remember the word.
How is your last name written?
Tom just watched.
I'd like to confirm my reservation for the 30th.
I will be working on my report all day tomorrow.
Tom noticed that Mary looked worried.
Are you sure you don't want me to stay?
His doctor advised him to give up smoking.
Can I catch a taxi near here?
Tom wants someone to close the window.
Tom can't lend Mary any money right now.
Tom put the guitar case down so he could hug Mary.
Do you like my friend?
He has short hair.
Tom hurried away.
I don't want to eat any more.
School is over.
My mother made me study.
Life isn't all roses and sunshine.
I'll admit I'm wrong.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
"Tom is sick, but it isn't serious."
I thought I'd be fine.
He did not accept their invitation.
He's very young. He's much younger than Tom.
Tom studied hard.
Where are you taking me?
Was Tom on drugs?
Tom took out the garbage.
Do you want a lawyer?
How can you say such a foolish thing?
This hotel is anything but satisfactory.
Can you teach me how to steal?
Was he in Hokkaido last year?
I think we should have a picnic here every year.
How do you know what I'm thinking?
We're not in the 80s anymore.
"Tom said he had eaten nothing, but that wasn't true."
You're being evasive.
Just try it out.
You're very observant.
You're contributing.
No one listens to me when I talk.
Is that a bat?
I don't remember having had any toys when I was young.
Have some.
I work for a trading company.
I have no money with me.
What was your question?
This job is too much for me.
What a fool I've been!
Ask him when the next plane will be.
Tom made a lot of money in the stock market.
Tom was late again this morning.
That's all I saw.

We're in danger.
Tom ordered a burger and fries.
I love you for that.
I've done business with Tom before.
The movie wasn't all that great.
Did it rain here yesterday?

I've learned to think like Tom thinks.
Please be sure to come on time.
Tom likes Boston better than any other place he's lived.
I'd like to be your friend.
Somebody tried to kill you.
That's a very pretty blouse.
I can tell my best friend anything.
I didn't take part in the conversation.
Do you want me to answer?
It was a good and interesting night.
Tom is writing a book.
Tell me over dinner.
This building is near completion.
Tom and I don't like the same kind of music.
Tom heard the temple bell in the distance.
I know what you want to do.
This part of the land belongs to my stepmother.
Tom hates your guts.
I was a witness.
I'm tired of waiting for things to happen.
They are all irritable.
The robbers came out from behind the trees and attacked him.
Tom showed me an interesting video.
I can't believe I'm here again.
I was in the right place at the right time.
We have no objection to doing that.

"Every time I see you, I think of your mother."
"I'm really hungry, but I can't decide what I want to eat."
How old is your dog?
I'm not a coward.
I spilled coffee on your tablecloth.
I'm sending Tom to school in Boston.
There is an urgent need for blood donations.
A kiss without a mustache is like a bowl of soup with no salt.
Tom is very inconsiderate.
Tom told everybody at work that he was going to retire.

I'll make it up to you.
Nobody will notice.

You are a bad person.
They're not afraid of hard work.
It would be better if you read more books.
He became a great musician.
I need to shave.
They dashed water into my face.
Peaches taste sweet.
Tom hardly ever speaks to Mary anymore.
Has she ever fallen in love?
I want you to remember this moment.
You have to stop Tom.
I'm not much heavier than you.
Don't let him touch it.
The nurse will tell you how to do it.
That class has 15 boys and 28 girls.
I often went to the movies with my father.
Mary can't come. She has to take care of her daughter.
I don't want to visit Tom.
I guess asking Tom to help is out of the question.
"Before you leave home, make sure your pets have enough food."
My grandfather speaks very slowly.

"Wait for your turn, please."
Will Tom sing?
I'll handle Tom.
I'm trying to be happy.

His room was brightly lit.
Tom is smart and hardworking.
He could not believe his eyes.
Will you still be here when I get back?
Don't worry about such a trivial problem.
It sounds like Tom.
Tom terrified Mary.
That could take hours.
I don't have to answer your questions.
Do you have any similar expressions in French?
How did you get to know him?

She likes Russian pop.
He couldn't do such a thing.
That was the plan.

The classroom is full of teenagers. A couple of them are asleep.

Would you like to watch a movie?
Is that the map that Tom gave you?
You almost crashed into my car.
I'll get in touch with you as soon as possible.

I hope I'm not intruding.
Do you think you'd have time to help me learn French?

"His little sister is very cute, isn't she?"
Have you figured out the math problem yet?
Cuff him.
My hobby is playing the guitar.
Tell them what I told you.

Tom is motionless.
He has recently made remarkable progress in English.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Do you trust me?
He didn't care about going to Heaven.
"I remember her face, but I don't remember her name."

Tom helps anybody that asks him.
I quit my job the day before yesterday.
I'd like to help you reach your goals.
Tom spent all afternoon cleaning his room.
"If I'd had a little more money, I would have bought it."
You must be more careful about spelling and punctuation.
I didn't expect his behavior to descend to such a disagreeable level.
You hit the center of the target.
We mentioned that gentleman in the conversation.
He chipped the edge of the tea cup.
Try to guess.
Tell us a joke.
Tom doesn't know whether Mary will come by car or by bicycle.
The man was handed over to the police.
She didn't have much difficulty finding out the answer to the problem.
Give them to him.
We can make this work.

The driver is deeply attached to his old car.
"They aren't children any more, but not adults yet."

Are you feeling sick?
I don't know what you want to hear.
Autumn is the best season for going on hikes.
The inhabitants of the city depend upon the river for drinking water.
It could be worse.
His ideas are too radical to be acceptable to most people.
I didn't give Tom choice.
This was really unfair.
He was living in London when the war broke out.
We only see each other on weekends.
She's Tom's sister.
Tom knows what's really going on.
You're really lucky.
I got some sand in my eye.
I don't see why we need to do this.
Do you really want to wear that?
She likes the beautiful pearl necklace very much.
Don't go out after dark.
We are anxious about your health.
There's nothing any of us can do for Tom now except let him die with dignity.

He believes whatever I say.

This orange is delicious.
Take a look in there.
Put the baby to sleep.
Tom is a new student.
I no longer live here.
Please water the flowers.
This book is worth reading.
What do you remember?
Tom can't deny the fact that he did what Mary accused him of doing.
That's the trigger.
That is the shop where I used to work.
Tom isn't stoned.
What a pretty girl!
Do I have to come on Monday?
The company's profits soared.
We're going hunting.
Why do you want to talk to Tom?
It's a thankless job.
The local train is less comfortable than the express train.
Tom is in very good health.
Nobody's laughing.
It works perfectly. You just don't know how to use it.
Don't ask me to do that again.
I'm feeling tired.
He did it out of curiosity.
Take my advice!
I can see the top of the mountain.
Tom heard a twig crack.
I'm not afraid at all.

That's asking too much.

Would you mind not smoking in this room?
How did you meet your husband?
I was hoping you'd come back.
I need it for the parking meter.
The police will find us if we stay here.
Tom jumped at the chance.
Let's try to find a way to help Tom.
You'll get a ticket if you park the car in front of a fire hydrant.
What floor do you live on?
Tom always wears goggles when he rides his motorcycle.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
Drive slowly.
We just got started.
Who's your mom?
Won't you come with us?
It has nothing to do with me.
I'm used to the noise.
They assemble typewriters.
Tom needs something.
We've made a final decision.
I wanted to go somewhere I'd never been before.
"In the 19th century, the number of immigrants grew rapidly."
The mystery of her death was never solved.
Tom was only gone for fifteen minutes.
I promise you'll be happy.
You're kidding!
Please take your time before deciding what to do.
I didn't get the job.
I will do anything but that.
I wonder whether Tom likes Chinese food.
What will your husband think?
We need to cancel the meeting.
I'll be back in a jiffy.
I saw Tom jump into the pool.
How many bowls of rice did you eat?
When do you need it?
"When he was 18, he married."

I'm meeting Tom for dinner. Do want to come?
We're upset.
Why would I tell you?
This is just as hard for me as it is for you.
"You know what's about to happen, right?"
This theory is scientifically controversial.
Tom and Mary are doing OK.
"At the most, the trip will cost $1,000."
Here's my address.
You won't be able to help us.
This is not what I ordered.
Tom thought the teacher had given him way too much homework to finish in one day.
He hasn't written to them in a long time.
Tom and Mary have one daughter and two sons.
That's rubbish.
"She's trying to whistle, but she doesn't know how."
Why in the world did you do that?
Do you like living here?
I never said that to you or anyone else.
Tom is on the third floor.
He was born in Africa.
Tom suddenly stopped talking.
Hopefully the weather will be just like today.
Do you want to come over and watch a movie with me?
I've got to see it.
Don't expect too much of him.

It matters to me.
I know you want to be happy.
Tom is an extraordinary person.
Tom is meditating.
It's a quarter to two.
Tom plays the organ very well.
"In order to catch animals, they used the bola."

"If it were not for my family, I would give up this job."
Where is the nearest internet cafe?
Tom is a socialist.
I never asked you to do that.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I want a dozen cream puffs.
That's Tom's brother.
I don't go in for that sort of thing.
You can go wherever you want to go.
Is this seat taken?
The water has been cut off.
It won't be that bad.
Wait here till I return.
"If Tom finds out I told you this, he'll kill me."
Tom answered the next question on the list.
This radio is out of order.
My new job is harder than my old one.
Please take this seat.
"Which do you usually drink, wine or beer?"
Tom is desperate.
It works.
He's a jerk.
Somebody moved out in a hurry.
It has happened before.
He was blue from the cold.
He cannot be relied on.
Tom isn't as good at French as he thinks he is.
Tom is very good to Mary.
Boston is where it all began.
It's 3:30.
They elected her chairperson.
Tom hasn't returned yet.
I'm glad we're together now.
Tom wasn't expecting something this bad to happen.
We need to go out with each other more often.
We don't have any time to waste.
He died when he was 54 years old.
Tom got off at the wrong station.
Where did you buy your pants?
A mere repetition of other people's research cannot be called true scientific research.
I wish I had taken better care of myself.
Try on both these coats and compare them.
You're confused.
I hope nobody saw you coming in here.
I just don't understand why it's happened.
I don't even know how to dance.
It's about time.
I had suspected as much.
Tom was in the cabin.
Who told you to do that?
We had to cooperate with each other.
I just learned to play poker.
You don't need to be afraid.
Could you speak a little louder please?
It's a wonder they're still awake.
That's why I was late.
I haven't finished speaking yet.
That book's done a lot to popularize chemistry.
You may use this car.
I will be sixteen years old next year.
Give Tom my thanks.
"If I were you, I'd ask him."
There is an urgent need for improved living conditions.
He is faced with a difficult problem.
Why do you keep giving him money?
Is that singer popular among your friends?
I can't pay you back the money you lent me.
We don't need a visa to go to France.
I filled in my own name on the form.
I'd like a city map.
I bought the girl a sweater.
"When it comes to fishing, he's an expert."
It's a difficult country to govern.
Won't you tell me?

It's going to be good.
I'm busy right now.
She has a perfect body.
You did what had to be done.
Alice will tell you that in Wonderland everything is topsy-turvy.
Tom began pacing.
Tom recovered quickly.
I don't know how to drive.
My father is a proud man.
His room was covered with dust.
I think I made a mistake.
The human brain weighs about three pounds.
How does he do this?
"If you're tired, go to bed."
He is rarely in a good mood.
What time is good for you?
This dog is shaggy.
What did you do during the summer when you were a kid?
Tom whispered something to Mary.
This medicine is good for a cold.
He isn't a diligent student.
I shook my head a few times.
"Of all the houses we've looked at, this one is by far the best."
I've learned a lot since then.
Tom gave up on doing that.
I doubt that Tom is innocent.
Are you happy in your house?
It happened just the other day.
Tom bent over backwards to please Mary.
That was very good.
Tom is terribly funny.
Do you think we can find someone to replace Tom?
There's no more salt.
Tom wanted Mary to win.
The curtain rose.
Tom parked his car in the vacant lot next to Mary's house.
Let Tom carry it.
I'm making a movie.
"I lived in Tokyo a few years ago, but now I live in Kyoto."
Was Tom fired?
Put yourself in my place.
I'm going to the village tomorrow.
I'll sleep when I'm dead.
"Tom, answer me!"
Tom loves bananas.
Nobody asked Tom.
Everybody probably thinks I'm crazy.
Tom has really taught me many things.
It's cold in here.
Tell Tom the air conditioner isn't working.
"You already knew that, didn't you?"
Did you wait for Tom?
The eagle is king of birds.
I can't find my plane ticket.
I will promise you nothing.
It's a pheasant.
I felt very happy.
I have a few friends in the United States.
This is the last time I'll ask you to do anything for me.
You're prettier than me.
She got her brother to walk the dog.
Does it snow a lot here in the winter?
I hope to hear from you soon.
What's your favorite dessert with strawberries?
Stop listening to Tom.
Tom felt betrayed.
You just have to know that it works. You don't need to know how it works.
How come you didn't say anything?
Tom asked for help.
They filmed the entire ceremony.
Don't embarrass me.
It's white.
Nobody knows you're here.
Tom gave Mary a lift home.
She sleeps on her back.
I'd like to know the rest of the story.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
"Better to die on our feet, than to live on our knees."
This bed is too soft for me.
Tom and Mary were alone in the cave.
Nothing can stop me.
Wait a moment.
He is sharp-witted.
I can't wait to meet you all.
I want to take this with me.
Tom looked through the small window in the door.
Are you interested in politics?
What am I going to do?
Tom said he didn't mean to hurt you.
I'd like to see Tom and Mary get along with each other.
She forgave the boy for his rudeness.
What's Tom going to think?
I'm starving!
I swim almost every day.
I took advantage of my business trip to see the sights of Paris.
Tom might hear you.
Nobody believed you.
I didn't realize it was so late.
I hear you have jobs for us.
Tom whispered something to Mary and then left the room.
Tom is almost six feet tall.
He handed the salesclerk the money.
Almost everyone in this room is taller than I am.
Tom has no right to give me orders.
Are these your horses?
Now I understand what you mean.
Is that sweet?
His new book is going to come out next month.
Tom is full of good intentions.
The government adopted strong measures to fight inflation.
"Hello, everyone, I'm Tom."
I'm new.
Why are you getting upset?
Tom probably won.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
All communication with the mainland was cut off by the typhoon.
I saw Tom get in a car.
Tom knows us very well.
I'd love to see you.
He's got what it takes to make it in the business world.
He has no political ambition.
Tom has to be there by 2:30.
Tom is playing the violin now.
I don't let my kids watch TV.
Tom fainted at the sight of the needle.
Tom lit the candles.
I found it easy to answer the question.
Tom is average.
You can't be two places at once.
"Add 5 and 2, and you get 7."
Your poor memory is due to poor listening habits.
Tom was homeschooled.
I have to say no.
"No matter what you say, I won't change my mind."
No woman is as arrogant as she is.
You should have one of us do it.
They are all in a hurry to catch a train.
I read a couple of more chapters before I went to sleep.
Tom has brown hair and blue eyes.
It's not a snake. It's only a piece of rope.
"If there's anything you want to do, you should do it if it makes you happy."
Our escape was nothing short of a miracle.
What's your favorite sport?
Your problems are nothing compared to mine.
She ignored him all day.
I guess this is goodbye.
How clever!
This factory is almost fully automated.
Tom is Mary's ex-boyfriend's brother.
Tom passed out from the heat.
I was always a loner.
I'd like to schedule an appointment with Dr. Jackson.
The flood prevented me from crossing the river.
It's your duty to vote.
She advised him not to believe everything the teacher says.
You may not be right.
He expressed his opinion in a few words.
The rich are not always happier than the poor.
Tom is a psychologist.
Shall I check the oil?
There is a fork missing.
"You're a philosopher, aren't you?"
I don't find this amusing.
Do you want to know who did this?
You must never forget that.
I'd like to kiss you.
Are you Canadian?
Play it again.
Would you please tell me the way?
I have neither time nor money.
I would have failed without his help.
Tom and Mary remind me of my parents.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom works as a bank clerk during the week and as a part-time lifeguard on weekends.
I asked for a seat in the non-smoking section.

I ran for my life.

I can't reach that can of tomatoes.
She decided on a blue dress.
I'll be watching you.
She cooks well.
My nose is itchy.
Tom spent many years in prison.
Is it easy to get there?

Tom appears agitated.
There were maybe up to a thousand people there.
I want you to leave right now.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Tom was home all night.

I decided to tell her that I love him.
I always feel sleepy.
Do you want to hear it?
Are you still friends with them?

It's not polite to speak with your mouth full.
I just didn't know what to do.
"Tom, be reasonable."
You should smoke less.
Tom didn't say whether he would go to Mary's party or not.
Tom isn't as smart as his older brother.
He's your friend.
There's one thing I must tell you.
I had a pretty happy childhood.
Tom can handle French quite well.
Let them do their jobs.
I have three siblings.
Every day I either ride a bike or get the bus to work.
I've got to start fighting back.
They supplied us with food.
What a cute baby! May I hold her?
She should not have done such a thing.
No one looks happy.

Please call a taxi.
She is not in the least worried about her test scores.
Why doesn't he smile at me anymore?
Guess who's coming for dinner.
Tom felt terrific.
That question is easy to answer.
Tom thinks that he's the center of the universe.
I would've apologized to Tom if I'd thought I needed to.
Tom is brilliant.
It's all nonsense.
I will be seventeen next week.
I guess I'm spoiled.
Can't you see Tom is trying to help you?
Children often make mistakes.
I hope that helps.
You look surprised.
I'll be here in my office if anyone needs me.
Tom loosened his tie and poured himself a drink.
"Because I was in a hurry, I had to take a taxi."
I want to know why you lied to me.
It may break.
He is facing many difficulties.

One hundred dollars will cover all your expenses for the trip.
You should've seen the look on Tom's face when he found out.
We'll do that.

Don't smoke while you are on duty.
Why are you pouting?
Call Tom and ask him to come back.
The doors are locked.
Tom looks very young.
She is a fox.
We can't allow Tom to leave.
Some people are allergic to latex.
Let's go away.
You had better hurry. The train leaves at three.
Defend yourselves.
He owes me a favor.
I'm a little early.
I'll tell Tom right now.
Do you think I should write to Tom?
He placed the ladder against the fence.
I got bored with his long talk.
The new plan is based on our idea.
He is said to be a genius.
Why didn't you tell us about this sooner?
Tom can speak French.
Tom bit his lip.
I honestly didn't think Tom would show up.
He didn't tell me everything.
Tom appeared intoxicated.
Would you like to come?
He crossed his legs.
He knows how to curse in Chinese.
I threw my back out.
How many hours a day do you study French?
I wish I were a bird.
"Can you speak louder, please?"
I'll do that for Tom.
Take it.
I just did what they told me to do.
I'll fix you a cup of tea.
They are sitting in the kitchen and drinking tea.
I know Tom better than anybody else does.
"I went not once, but twice."
Prices have jumped.
A cat appeared from behind the curtain.
Do you drink beer?
He wants to learn to swim.
I'm sure Tom was happy.
You must not tell a lie.
"Obviously, Tom isn't interested."
I can't help you with this.
Mary is a very independent girl.
He came from another country.
Mom has a fever.
I am going to play tennis tomorrow.

Tom is a real nuisance.
The two men shook hands.
What does your son do?
I had my job interview in the meeting room.
Last summer was very hot.
He acknowledged his faults.
You should do something with your hair.
What are you guys up to?
Tom speaks French better than he pretends to.
He arrived in time for the meeting.
Who's responsible for this?
I failed miserably.
Fasten your seat belt.
I will protect you from danger.
Will you look after my children for me?
Tom wasn't able to open the box.
Tom called a cab for me.

Tom is a friend of a friend of mine.
Where would you like to go first?
What were you doing then?
I heard you laughing.

Look at the sleeping baby.
Tom was fighting.
How could you do this to Tom?
I don't remember my father anymore.
I thought we were out of coffee.
That fight seemed like a life-or-death struggle.
Tom never loses his cool.
I have no time to engage in gossip.
Can you make yourselves understood in French?
Tom doesn't help me.
It's pretty unusual.
That's a good brand.
I'm just watching TV.
I thought Tom was Mary's father.
My father finally learned to drive when he was fifty.
The wedding will take place at the end of October.
How dare you say such a thing to me!
How many pairs of shoes do you own?
Don't drink beer before going to bed.
A committee has been set up to investigate the problem.
The prisoners fled from the concentration camp.
You should acknowledge your failure.
I'm glad you're here today.
I want you to tell me everything that happened.
You'd be a great mother.
What happened in Boston wasn't your fault.
Tom might know something.
Didn't you get Tom's message about today's meeting?
I've got this little job I want you to do.
What else do you know about Tom?
His speech bored me.
Can you speak a little slower?
You seem to be a little under the weather.
My memory is blank on the subject.
Everything's ready.
I didn't have lunch today.
Tom seems to know the way.
Tell me more about yourself.

I've warned you over and over again not to do it.
Are you hiding from Tom?
There are fifty families in this village.
I don't want to give up.
This is how I did it.

"I don't have to go, but you do."
I like to watch TV in my Jacuzzi.

He seems tired.
Many countries have abolished capital punishment.
Don't bring that dirty dog through the kitchen.
Some people never learn.
What was the score at halftime?
You talk as if you were the boss.
Do you think our team will win?
Tom is a minor.
Would you like to come in?
Tom doesn't care about money.
All the houses on my street lost power this morning due to the storm.
He says he met my father.
The Greens are against everything.
There's no other way to say this.
He will do his best to finish it on time.
He is acquainted with the modern history of France.
I really don't think that this is of any importance to us.
Tom won't let you go.

I am hers and she is mine.
I was impressed with what I saw.
Tom says he usually buys a new car every three years.

I love old books.
Tom's lying.
The fight lasted three seconds.
I want to ask Tom what he'll do.
The world is a crazy place.

Are you here to see me?
Tom is going to be sorry.
Tom doesn't know what I do.
Tom will die in prison.
I had a strange dream last night.

He is an actor.
Tom had a heart attack while shoveling snow.
I will not be busy tomorrow.
Did you ever think you'd see Tom doing something like that?
The children are crying again.
Tom got married three weeks ago.
Tom stole the money.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I'm disappointed with you.
Tom made himself a sandwich.
Tom is wrong.
Why don't you call him up?
They stopped talking as soon as I came into the room.
That's where Tom is.
Tom saw you.
I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom doesn't come.
You should not wear a fur coat.
I forgot to turn off the light.
This is so unlike you.
"After the game, he went straight home to feed his dog."
We can't give you your job back.
About how many English words do you know?
I know that I'm right.
There is hardly any danger of an earthquake.
I'll call the chef.
That's news to me.
We go fishing together once in a while.
I have to warn Tom.
Tom didn't even look at Mary.
I'm now married.
Is my laundry ready?
This bracelet is more expensive than that one.
The police have cleared the square.
This makes me very happy.
That's a very sensitive issue.
Those scientists are the cream of the crop.
I hate to lose.
Call my husband.
When did Tom say that?
The telephone rang again.
I am a redhead.
He was nearly run over at an intersection.
Is Tom confident?
I think you should visit him.
The boy lifted the heavy box with one hand.
I traveled on foot.
That's altogether wrong.
He accepted reluctantly.
Somehow Tom doesn't seem to be Mary's type.
Expensive meals can't compensate for lack of sleep.
Tom pointed to a word on the sign and asked Mary what it meant.
I need to ask you to leave.
The stadium is adjacent to the school.
I think you're working way too hard.
Tom came home very late.
Give Tom a call.
When did you get your first tattoo?
Tom might not eat this kind of cheese.
It's strange that Tom didn't mention that.
You should've come with us.
I'll never leave Boston again.
My mother was in the hospital during the summer.
Tom doesn't understand that at all.
She provided the traveler with food and clothing.
"Tom doesn't drink much beer, but he sure drinks a lot of wine."
Tom and Mary want to buy a house with at least three bedrooms.
It is sometimes hard to tell right from wrong.
Did Tom die?
You might want to consider buying some new tires for your car.
I'd like a room with a good view.
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.
Never in my life have I heard or seen such a thing.
Do you want to see where Tom is buried?
You're useless.
The ice on the lake is too thin to bear your weight.
They looked very happy.
She planted some pansies in the flower bed.
Tom would like to know why you did that.
I should've known Tom had something to do with it.
I think Tom wants to see you.
My father is in good health.
I'll play with you.
How long have you been traveling?
The reason why you failed is you did not try hard enough.
I tried to scream.
Tom didn't know who to believe.
"Who do you love more, your mom or your dad?"
Who cheated?
All of a sudden they stopped talking.
You're negligent.
The weather was so cold that the lake froze over.
It's usually a good thing.

There's nothing worse than that.
She's still under age.
This has to stop.
The bridge is under construction.
We bought a pound of tea.
About how much money do you have?
You are as tall as my sister.
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Tom didn't think that what Mary said was true.
Could I get a receipt?
I didn't win.
She is about my age.
Please welcome our next contestant.
That girl looks like her mother.

Tom is here with me.
Tom went missing.
I like math.
The whole room became silent.

I don't want to be told what to do.
It can't be!
Tom said he didn't know when Mary would be arriving.
Over two hundred guests attended Tom and Mary's wedding.
She came back an hour later.

How is it going with Tom?
I'll tell you an interesting story.
Everything is all right now.
When was the last time you saw Tom?

You always seem tired.
That's absolute nonsense.
He has made little progress in his English.
I have a friend whose father is the captain of a big ship.
Tom's room was very small.
I'll get it.
What's Tom found?
Tom lived with his uncle in Boston while going to college.
"If you won a million yen, what would you do?"
That love affair is a family secret.
Let's wait for another 5 minutes.
Tom was only pretending to be asleep.
Tom wants to spend time with Mary.
I'll come and see you one of these days.
Only those who risk going too far will know how far one can go.
Here's my telephone number.
This will do for now.
Autumn came and the leaves started to fall.
Mary wore a white miniskirt.
Tom hung up the phone.
We know it was you that killed Tom.
Pay attention to what I say.
Silence implies consent.
Tom is a little overweight.
We can't wait.
That's the one.
Tom often plays tennis with Mary after school.
Tom kissed Mary goodbye and left.
The engineers blew up the bridge because it was about to collapse.
Can anyone confirm your story?
I was late to school.
I am disappointed that my friend is not here.
I knew you'd come back.
What time is your plane?
There are only 24 hours in a day.
I'm taking you home.
"Nevertheless, the topic is worth discussing."
Think carefully before answering.
He reached the rank of general.
Tom and Mary want to know more about John.

You have my permission to leave.
What will the neighbors think?
I'm going to help you do it.
I'm working on a new book.
The girls are excited.
Tom never wants to see Mary again.
Tom prefers to take a shower in the morning while Mary prefers to take a bath just before going to bed.
How did you become interested in studying languages?
Who gave you your nickname?
That job paid well.
I'm warning you for the last time.
He doesn't like us.
Did you know that Tom has three children?
"Hey, why don't you take a break?"
She's wearing high heels.
I don't know why we came here.
She isn't married.
They got here yesterday.
I did not want to alarm you.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
These earphones don't work.
It's all right.
I like tennis the best of all sports.
I have never been to England.
A helicopter circled over us.
No one flinched.
Bonds were issued to finance a war.
I can only import GIF files.
"Tom speaks French well, but not as well as he speaks English."
Do you know what's wrong with Tom?
Tom was barely alive when we found him.
We're all proud of you.
We'll talk later.
Don't you trust Tom?
I'm a beginner.
"Tom wants me to open the window, so he can climb in."
It took a long time for me to get used to the noise.
My wife is afraid to drive my new car.
He waved at her.
Do it once again.

Tom quit smoking.
She is eight.
I'm really upset.
Tom would like to paint his room blue.
The river is deep here.
We were playing on the beach.
"Of course, recognizing our common humanity is only the beginning of our task."

I don't want you to make the same mistake I made.
These diamonds are from South Africa.
I speak French much better than Tom does.
What do you call your dog?
Take all the time you need.
We want to love and be loved.

I live in Boston with my family.
You could've said something.
I can't believe I'm graduating this year.
Tom never told me his last name.
It was in 1950 that he was born.
Can I have a cup of coffee first?
Do you own a gun?
Aren't you going to see Tom?
You don't seem to have any problem communicating in French.
He's a chain smoker.
Rainy season begins in June.
Do you know why he couldn't come?
"We need actions, not words."
I couldn't have done this without your help.
Tom has changed his plans.
I'm not busy now.
Do you have this in my size?
I enjoy being a teacher.
"Close your eyes, please."
Could you please help me?
Mary and I dated a long time ago.
"You were wrong. ""Yes, but I was almost right."""
Tom shouldn't make fun of Mary's limp.
The majority didn't accept the proposal.
Tom said that he was thirsty.
I'm sick and tired of this.
Is it too salty?
Have you already eaten breakfast?
A father and son represent two generations.
Do you think we can help Tom?
Thank you for doing me this favor.
Just try it.
Have a nice vacation.
Tom rented a car for the weekend.
You shouldn't look down on him.
My friends don't know where I am.
Tom decided to buy a new computer.
Who did you call?
I'm taking Tom home with me.
What did he look up?
How much is the most expensive car?
Tom asked Mary's father to buy him a ticket.
"Give me the salt, please."
Is that possible?
It's totally different.
Tom took Mary back to her car.
My husband is an expert when it comes to cooking Chinese food.
That he will succeed is certain.
Tom and Mary fight constantly.
Did you write this book?
Do you drink beer or wine?
There's a beautiful bridge over the pond.
I'm not too happy.
The Mormons left Illinois in the spring of 1846.
He stuck the notice on the board with tacks.
What books have you read in French?
There was blood on Tom's pillow.
I just can't overlook his rude behavior.
The elevator was out of order and we had to walk to the fifth floor.
I'm very hot.
I have no idea where Tom went.
Tom nodded once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
I don't like the house he lives in.
I brought a pizza.
How many brothers and sisters does Tom have?
Tom organized his CDs by artist.
I like the way you think.
This is one of the dictionaries I told you about yesterday.
He took the trouble to show me the way to the station.
She advised him to go by bicycle.
We've endured for long enough.
Where did you learn karate?
Tom resumed reading.
"He was very tall, so I recognized him at once."
I only heard the end of Tom's speech.
I don't know Tom that well yet.
She has traveled in foreign countries.
Put the book back where you found it.
"I plan to help Tom steal some cars. ""That would be unwise."""
Shame on you.
Don't accuse him of that.
Just follow your heart.
It wouldn't hurt.
My cell phone doesn't work.
I don't know if I can do this without you.
It is not always easy to read between the lines.
Tom sat down next to someone he didn't know.
Tom stood alone.
There is nothing more important than friendship.
Where is the restroom?
There is no hope.
Tom missed the last train.
Tom visits his parents every weekend.
I banged my leg on the coffee table.
What happened in the meeting?
Don't let him hit his sister.
I am brushing my hair.
Tom and Mary were at John's funeral.
Try it without sauce.
Tom was a spoiled child.
Perhaps you should stop.
I haven't seen you around before.
"What Tom said made you smile, didn't it?"
That's how we do things.
The worst thing about winter is the snow.
That's very sweet of you.
This river is not polluted.
Do you know when Tom's birthday is?
The cat is on the table.
That's enough.
It uses solar power.
We have the same problem.
There's no point in waiting.
I don't agree with the government's policy on education.
Not everybody succeeds in life.
Tom must've died.
Tom talked about himself.
I want to die.
Tom is wet.
I could solve the problem without any difficulty.
What time tomorrow morning would you like me to pick you up?
I've got to do this now.
I'm not done.
I don't want you to overexert yourself.
Don't make an enemy of Tom.
He knows how to talk to customers.
Is it a direct flight?
I can't let you do that.
I don't want to believe you.
It is often easier to make plans than to carry them out.
Primitive calculating machines existed long before computers were developed.
I'd like you to get me a cup of coffee.
Let's discuss that problem later.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing?
Mary is hanging up the laundry.
"A man as diligent as he is, is sure to succeed."
The door was still closed.
I like the smell of fresh bread.
Tom looked terrified.
I heard you were sick.
Tom jumped bail.
I can't remember how to use this machine.
Peel the potatoes and carrots.
"The more careful you are, the fewer mistakes you make."
Two plus two makes four.
It's great.
Tom isn't angry.
Have you ever cut your finger with a knife?
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
I bet you know French.
Does everyone think it was me who stole the money?
Do you know how embarrassing this is for Tom?
My general impression is that it is very good.
"If you're not quiet, I'm going to ask you to leave."
Tom doesn't like kids.
It is exactly three o'clock now.
Tom has a son named John.
Can it wait until tomorrow?
I like the cold.
"You do love Tom, don't you?"
Why did you allow it to happen?
I may stay in Boston for another day.
Would you mind if we stayed here for a while?
I stayed there for three days.
Tom saw where Mary lives.
That's a matter of prime importance.
Tom doesn't have to do that now.
That's the true reason.
I wonder why Tom is crying.
I dropped my keys.
Don't you want to come along?
He studied hard and passed the test.
Who did Tom kiss?
Tom misses Boston.
You're quite smart.
What was your motive?
It is on this point that our opinions differ.
I'd jump through hoops for you.
Tom doesn't have to do it.
Stop changing the subject.
They voted.
The doctor came immediately.
Provide water to the thirsty and food to the hungry.
I was just asking a question.
I applaud your decision to quit smoking.
I thought I heard something outside.
I suppose you want to ask me how I was able to make so much money in so little time.
A revised edition of the encyclopedia was published.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
You're not alone.
He rang me up at midnight.
I'm painting Easter eggs.
Stay away from that guy.
Tom looked away.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Tom was the only one in the room.
Why isn't it here?
I have sinned.
I didn't know we weren't supposed to help.
Tom meant well.
Who put a frog in my bed?
It was very hard.
Tom's angry.
I'll be in the car.
Do you think children born today will have better lives than their parents?
Take your time. There's no hurry.
There were various objects in the room.
The young soldier was confused.
What did you say these are called?
I don't know her real name.
He popped the trunk.
Tom appeared on the steps.
"At last, we reached England."
Why don't you go play outside?
How do you interpret this poem?
Tom is distracted.
He stood aloof from her.
Hurry! We don't have a lot of time.
Why does that make a difference?
I don't remember asking for it.
"Time goes by very quickly, doesn't it?"
How many kids do you have?
The police conducted an offensive against some drug dealers.
It's very unlikely that Tom's children inherited anything from him.
What did you do with Tom?
The team was quite nervous before the game.
I know you love me.
He let his dog run free in the field.
I promise not to sing.
I'm just doing my job.
I helped him with his homework.
Tom and Mary aren't speaking to each other.
We'll paint it.
Did you give it to him last year?
Tom got hit by a golf ball.
Let's not forget the real reason we're here.
Are they displayed all through the year?
Tom doesn't want us.
I enjoyed your company.
Somebody answered.
They have a lot in common.
Do you know your strengths and weaknesses?
It was heartless of him to say such a thing to the sick man.
Do that for me.
Tom didn't quit.
I have homework to do.
She must have studied very hard.
I am ashamed of having been lazy.
He has no fear.
It is really nice of you.
You've really done a fine job.
We don't walk anywhere anymore.
"Whatever he may say, I won't change my mind."
How many other girls have you said that to?
Tom can't talk.
"Tom likes Mary, and so do I."
There are many people living in this house.
It seems that they have quarreled.
Thanks for accepting my friend request on Facebook.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
The mayor of this city was blamed for turning a deaf ear to the people's requests.
He's very stingy.
When does he get back from his trip?
Tom knows a lot of people.
I am trying to learn English.
What did they argue about?
Tom said he wouldn't do it again.
What do you want now?
The girl I told you about lives in Kyoto.
The Red Cross supplied the hospital with blood.
Get me out of here.
"The man, who had not eaten for three days, had trouble thinking about anything except food."
"When Tom lost his job, he couldn't keep up his mortgage repayments and he was threatened with foreclosure."
You can't believe a word of it.
Leave my stuff alone.
Multiple-choice tests are not uncommon.
Would you please stop singing so loudly? This is not a cheap drinking place.
I miss my friends.
Be quiet for a second.
Why are men so dumb?
You can trust him.
Mary does look a bit like Alice.
He decided on the red car.
Anything new?
I have seen it a lot.
I consulted Tom.
Tom is afraid of snakes.
Who do you think will be chosen?
I wish I'd been born Canadian.
The teacher permitted him to go home.
Tom tucked his shirt into his pants.
Thank you so much for this.
Can I dance here?
Is Tom swimming?
Tom and Mary went to the zoo together.
You can't prove a thing.
The visitor asked the class a question.
I'd like to pay by credit card.
Tom saved everybody.
Volcanic ash covered the city.
You'll be punished if you do that again.
Bad weather prevented us from leaving.
You must go through with your plan.
Are those guys from your school?
She witnessed the crime.
Leave my room immediately.
What're you doing sitting here alone in the dark?
Clear off the table.
"Where there is a will, there is a way."
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
Tom didn't return till 2:30.
I don't always do this.
Two boys are absent from school today.
A gentle wind is blowing.
Tom likes to listen to music while he's studying.
How long ago was it?
I taught Tom French for three years.
I appreciate what you did yesterday.
I give you my word on it.
Who complained?
Have you heard from him?
He's a big coward.
The smell was offensive.
Tom helped Mary into the car.
The conference will end tomorrow.
Man is the only animal that laughs.
Tom got that bicycle from Mary.
It's all over.
"You may not believe it, but it is nonetheless true."
We both know what happened.
"What kind of music do you want to hear? ""Put on something romantic."""
Say you love me.
She looked excited.
A gang of thieves broke into the bank.
Has he lived here for two years?
You should've seen the look on Tom's face when I told him.
He put on the red jacket.
How long will this nice weather last?
Are you in the library?
Can you chip in?
"I used to love her, but not anymore."
I found it.
Tom wears a ring.
You know people.
Tom asked me if I were hungry.
Everybody is very busy.
My father never looked down on the poor.
Tom looks crazy.
"Tom is thirty, but he looks much younger."
The sun sank below the horizon.
You look just like my sister.
You're very brave.
Tom had no one to tell his story to.
He was very gifted and talented.
Tom said that he was starved.
"First, you must protect yourself."
That child stuck out his tongue at me.
Maybe I should become a painter.
Eat more vegetables.
Will you make a list of issues to discuss?
How does Tom know?
That's Tom's house.
I would like to ask two questions.
I can't believe you're eating what the doctor told you not to eat.
I have no fever.
"The telephone was just ringing, wasn't it?"
"In other words, he betrayed us."
Tom's timing couldn't have been better.
Tom is trying to kill me.
What is the jacket made of?
How does Tom do that?
I love you more and more each day.
My son is engaged to his secretary.
We saw many unusual plants in the botanical garden.
She spoke rapidly.
Give me an orange.
Can you do that again?
How will you stop me?
He was my best friend in high school.
This is all a waste of time.
Forest conservation is an important issue all over the world.
You're going to get us both killed.
Two vanilla ice creams please.
I have lived here for thirty years.
Tom has a cute girlfriend.
Tom was standing in front of the grill wearing a cook's apron.
All I know is that she left last week.
Tom only does what he has to do.
Watch us.
Could I get a discount if I pay in cash?
Has the pain been this bad all week?
Today is my best friend's birthday.
Tom is leaving on a trip on Friday.

I like this color.
He'll never forgive me.
What happens if we fail?
I believe they're a perfect match.
Tom has a deep affection for Mary.
Did you enjoy the salad?
This I have to see.
"Don't just eat fish. Eat some meat, too."
I want one like that.
Everybody had a good year.
I looked around and noticed that mine was the only car on the road.
A silver wedding anniversary celebrates 25 years of marriage.
This concert hall has wonderful acoustics.
We almost didn't get there on time.
Tom can't rely on Mary's help.
He's always joking.
He is a brave and cheerful boy.
Tom has quite a lot of money.
She described the scene in detail.
Do it by all means.
I met her at the church.
Tom can't stand Mary.
I don't like the house he lives in.
Tom isn't bossy.
Did I hurt your feelings?
A trip to America this summer is out of the question.
This makes the situation worse.
Do you have any red pencils?
You could hear a pin drop in the room.
I got it for nothing.
I have just finished my work.
Do you have anything to read?
I think you're making a big mistake.
This isn't a good sign.
Tom has no idea how to deal with this problem.
The farm workers unloaded the truck.
Tom's signature is illegible.
The cat is in the well.
Take care.
Tom is a real nuisance.
You are very likely right.
Tom decided he was too old for rock climbing.
I wonder if Mary realizes how poor Tom really is.
He was fully clothed.
Please don't tell anybody about this.
Tom and I used to be neighbors.
She had the courage to say it.
"Yesterday, I had him take my photograph."
Some people like shoveling snow.
I know exactly what you're doing.
I speak English every day.
You have a beautiful voice.
You don't have to come tomorrow.
I don't want you to think about it anymore.
He lives somewhere around here.
He speaks quickly.
"If you had left a little earlier, you would have avoided the heavy traffic."
You don't waste time.
I doubt if Tom would do that.
The headlights don't work.
What do you need that for?
"You understand, don't you?"
I'm sorry I had to lie to you.
I brought something for you.
Our flight was canceled.
Could we talk about last night?
The child followed me to the park.
Tom will drive.
They are facing financial problems.
That computer class was a waste of time.
How did you get the job?
She helped the old man cross the road.
I stayed at home all day instead of going to work.
"When I grow up, I want to be just like you."
That's pretty impressive.

Shouldn't you be at home with your mother?
Gold will not buy everything.
I have to park my car here.
Few people think so.
He is the right man for the post.
I didn't quite make out what he said.
I should've known you'd come back.
We went to the lake to row a boat.
Some animals are very good at climbing.
Both Tom and Mary are newspaper reporters.
I don't have the time to read this book.

I know that.
I'm a human being.
Tom got soaking wet.
Tom spoke highly of you.
Did you like Boston?
Does money bring happiness?
Mary is charming.
What nationality is Tom?
My friend got good marks in the English examination.
I expect to come.
Please put it aside for me.
I went for a walk in the park.
Tom told Mary about last night's ordeal.
"She simply cannot keep her mouth shut, not even for a second."
Tom and Mary had a bitter quarrel.
My back hurts.
I hope he will come.
Does this bus go to the museum?
Tom knocked on the door and then entered without waiting.
I usually eat out.
"What are you doing tonight? ""I'm not sure."""
You have to read between the lines.
Do you think I care?
Tom said that he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
Tom is always ready to help.
It becomes warmer day after day.
Tom is making great progress in French.
It has snowed for two days.
Where is he playing?
Did you telephone him?
I think there's a mistake on my bill.
"When I forgot my promise, he got really angry."
I don't believe everything Tom says.
How can you be so passive? Why don't you retaliate?
I haven't read any of his novels.
They agreed on a joint statement.
"If the weather is good, I'll go."
Tom lives with his mother.
Tom couldn't find Mary.
My opinion doesn't really matter.
He did nothing but watch TV all day.
Tom realized that what Mary said wasn't true.
Maybe Tom doesn't want you to worry.
Put it back on the desk.
We don't make mistakes.
Barcelona is in Spain.
There were lots of people in the stadium.
That was very funny.
The meeting ended at 4:00 p.m.
They want to kill me.
Keep the window closed.
They missed Tom.
Tom says he doesn't remember seeing Mary at the party.
They aren't mine.
He deserted his family and went abroad.
Have you always wanted to be a police officer?
He has too many books.
"Flattery is like counterfeit money; it makes the one who receives it, poorer."
He insulted me in public.
Tom sat up in bed and looked around.
I didn't want to see Tom's face.
Tom seems lonely.
You're a man now.
He attempted to escape.
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
Anything can happen on TV.
The girl I went to the movies with is a friend of mine.
I hope I didn't wake you.
The two men were tried by a military court.
Sea turtles are magnificent creatures.
What is the active ingredient in aspirin?
Customers haven't complained.
It's not what we want.

This is simple.
He comes to Tokyo once a year.
Stop complaining and do as you're told.
He started taking salsa lessons.

This bed is cold.
Saudi Arabia is very rich in oil.
Tom's parents were disappointed that he couldn't get into Harvard.
You can't lose what you don't have.
"By chance, I met my professor at a restaurant last night."
Who'd buy this?
I can't believe it's true.
The plane crash was only last week.
"How may I help you today, sir?"
Tom's past caught up with him.
Tom sure spends a lot of time at Mary's house.
I consulted him about the matter.
Go to your room and stay there until your father comes home.
You can wait for me here.
Everything is gone.
We must hurry or else the shop will be closed.
Do you want breakfast?
Doesn't Tom like Mary?
I walked my dog.
Do you miss Boston?
Nothing is as precious as love.
He earns his living by teaching English.
I feel powerless.
Tom knew that he was supposed to be doing something else.
Tom died young.
She was trembling with fear.
I'm not here every day.
Tom says that he loves Mary.
"Frankly speaking, he is more of a hypocrite than a patriot."
Tom and Mary are doing fine.
He must finish his homework today.
There are no comments yet.
I have a bone to pick with you.
He looked at the ship through his telescope.
How old will you be next year?
How do you pronounce your last name?
Please ask whether they have this book at the library.
I like wine.
You were late for work.
How do you help someone who doesn't want your help?
Tom snuck out and surreptitiously bought Mary a big bunch of flowers for their wedding anniversary.
Was Tom caught?
She was playing with her sister at that time.
You look very dignified.
Tom was lying in bed watching TV.
I have a serious skin problem.
Something is wrong with the engine of my car.
You said you wanted to be a teacher.
"When do you swim? ""I swim in July."""
How many instruments do you know how to play?
Who's your teacher?

Please pass me the salt and pepper.
Tom had a life insurance policy.
Tom looked very young.
Tom is taking this very seriously.
The meeting begins at three.
We were meant for each other.
We know you have it.
I'll walk with you as far as the supermarket.
No one I know wears a tie anymore.
Tom seated himself.
He bugged her with questions.
I will give it to you.
The moon is bright.
Tom almost never asks questions.
My watch isn't working properly.
You must get to know Tom.
There's a bus stop here.
Tom said that Mary helped you.
Tom convinced Mary that it wasn't his fault.
You have to believe in yourself.
I threw the paper into the fire.
That's hard to say.
That's really stupid.
I was watching TV then.
I want to find out what happened.
The next station is where you get off.
Nobody spoke with me.
Tom likes to do things like that.
I'm very proud of my son.
The rain lasted five days.
Tom has small hands.
How old is that dog?
The movie hasn't started yet.
That wasn't your fault.
How was Tom killed?
Your suitcases are over there.
I think what we just heard was Tom's voice.
Tom was always different from other children.
I didn't do any of the things you said I did.
Where are the meters?
The wind blew the umbrella out of her hand.
I don't want this news to be made public yet.
I'm glad you know the truth.
Tom called again.
I barely feel the pain anymore.
Tom heard a noise behind him and turned around to see what it was.
I taught Tom how to cook.
I've got a job.
I already know that.
I think you'd like it there.
"No matter how cold it is outside, the rooms are comfortably heated."
The children were well looked after.
Are you suggesting it's a design flaw?
"The traveler fainted from hunger, but soon he came to."
Don't sit down on the sofa.
Tom will protect you.
She is no better than a thief.
Hydration is critically important in hot weather.
Why are you siding with him?
I'd better go now.
Tom found out his dad wasn't his real dad.
That is essential.
You've done a good job here.
What is Tom to you?
It's bizarre.
Which side are you on?
We're not in Boston.
Cut the cloth diagonally.
I can't do this work alone.
I am tired of eating at the school cafeteria.
You can't stop Tom.
She acted in the play.
What you are saying does not make sense.
You should pack a lunch so you'll have something to eat on your hike.
Please turn off your engine.
He is cranky.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I actually don't work here.
I can't picture Tom doing that.
Blackboards are not always black.
He just barely managed to pass the test.
I love to bargain.
Let Tom do this.
The windows are open.
Don't leave your belongings unattended.
My dream is to become a firefighter.
He doesn't eat anything except fruit.
You can tell Tom not to worry.
This fluorescent lamp is starting to flicker. We'll have to replace it.
It rained very hard today.
Are you working today?
Tom and Mary split up after their son died.
It has been wonderful.
That was an incredible feeling.
The man who is waving to me is my uncle.
I don't see any way of stopping Tom from doing that.
Did you break it?
Were you expecting something different?
Tom thinks he can trust Mary.
"You have no idea what happened, do you?"
This is what happens when you don't pay attention to what you're doing.
Have you read that book?
Tom stirred his tea.
The thunder became louder.
One must do one's best.
How different is driving a truck compared to driving a car?
She wasn't wealthy enough to feed her dog meat every day.
I proved it to be true.
This course teaches basic skills in First Aid.
Tom never drinks except on special occasions.
Do you have school today?
He is a tall boy.
The same thing happened in 2013.
Don't be so sure.
I scarcely believed my eyes.
How does it feel to be back home?
It is careless of you to say such things.
They don't need me anymore.
Does that count?
That bridge has been out of use for a long time.
Most of the damage to the car is on the passenger's side.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't like chocolate?
Tom's mouth went dry.
Tom was unable to remember what he had eaten for breakfast.
The terrorists attacked a mosque.
We've received thirteen complaints so far this week.
Could you drop me off at the library?
Tom waited more than an hour.
I don't like this tie. Show me a better one.
I thought I heard someone knocking on the door.
I knew you'd understand.
Have you told Tom what to buy?
It's time for your therapy.
Tom returned the shirt because it was too small.
I love my mother very much.
The bank opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 3 p.m.
Tom is mesmerized.
He returned from China.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
Are you tired?
"I don't watch a lot of movies, but I can't resist a good documentary."
We're coming for you.
I bought lots of books.
"You can't give up now, not after all the effort you've put into this."
You know Tom likes Boston.
The phone rang while I was taking a shower.
I am very sorry.
Shall we stop soon?
Where did he go?
I miss the army.
Tom tied his dog to a tree.
This overcoat is inferior to mine in quality.
The train hasn't arrived yet.
My mother is on a diet.
You can't imagine how humiliating this is.
Her hands were as cold as ice.
I can't remember ever being so bored.
Do you mind if I change the channel?
You aren't allowed to take photographs.
It was rather funny.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up.
Tom closed his mouth.
How's Tom going to do it?
Many workers were laid off at that plant.
She's busy.
They are making a salad.
"Always keep a bucket of water handy, in case of fire."
How did you get to know her?
You ought not to have said a thing like that to him.
I met an old friend a short time ago.
She went shopping at a supermarket.
Can you do without an English dictionary?
I got a new camera.
That was totally uncalled for.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Please turn off the television.
Tom went on a safari.
Tom got into the car with Mary and they drove away.
Tom is the best dancer in the group and he knows it.
She wants to play golf with him.
We bought a comfortable new armchair.
Do you like smoked oysters?
Breakfast is at half past nine.
I want some tea without sugar.
The student's progress is satisfactory.
I feel that something is wrong.
He missed the train because of the traffic accident.
Which direction were they heading in?
Stand where you are or I'll kill you.
I have to share an office with Tom.
The kids jumped on the trampoline.
Tom didn't understand your joke.
Why are we laughing?
He angrily tore up the letter from her.
This report is not perfect.
Will you play with me tomorrow?
"I've been trying to find a way to reach Tom, but I can't."
Are you a religious person?
Where's my phone book?
Tom asked something.
She used to help him with his homework.
My opinion really doesn't matter.
That's what I want to ask.
Tom explained his plan in detail.
Have a good day at work.
They were caught red-handed.
Don't cut in with your remarks.
The police officer resolved the situation without resorting to violence.
I don't plan to see Tom till tomorrow.
Where are you planning to spend the night?
Let Tom know.
I met Tom on my way home from school.
We were nearly frozen to death.
I want to earn a lot of money.
I said I'd look after Tom.
I know how that feels.
Christmas is coming.
Some people are difficult to please.
Something had to be done.
I feel very good.
Tom got angry when he saw Mary kissing John.
Feel free to contact me.
Do you really think that Tom can help us?
What do you think about it?
His story amused everyone.
You deserve better.
A book came for you in the mail today.
Tom wanted to live on a farm.
"Unfortunately, I have other plans."
Don't smoke in this room.
Don't let anybody see you.
Nobody was able to suggest a solution.
Almost all of the dogs are alive.
There was a lot of food in the house.
"You gave Tom the money he asked for, didn't you?"
Don't you think it's still a little too early to talk to Tom about this?
"You miss it, don't you?"
We have to do something about what's going on.
I saw my friend running up the stairs.
They sell meat at this store.
I really need to hit somebody.
I'd love to come with you.
What is that thing in your right hand?
Do you go to school on foot?
They got married three months later.
I don't like Tom either.
My heart is pounding.
Tom was pretty upset.
I can't believe I actually said that.
Eating fish is good for your health.
Will you come and see me?
Tom must've been lying.
Do you have something to write with?
What do you suggest?
What're you going to do on Friday?
It goes without saying that camels are very useful in the Middle East.
Tom won't like that answer.
I'm not feeling very hungry right now.
We asked him on the interphone if he could come downstairs quickly.
There is a cherry tree in front of my house.
You may use my car at any time.
I remember returning the book to the library.
When do you want to meet Tom?
There are sushi restaurants in almost every country in the world.
"In her opinion, he is the best musician she has ever seen."
They didn't have enough money.
Do you want to help me?
Are they in love?
You'd be good at it.
Tom seems relaxed.
"The months with the most rain are May, June, July and August."
Don't force me do that again.
You can't really understand another person until you walk a mile in their shoes.
He left his wife.
Father was crazy about the game.
Do you know where we're going?
Has Tom ever asked you to help him?
I haven't seen Tom all day.
Tom is reading a book in the library.
"Tom called Mary, but the line was busy."
Don't worry about us.
Fry an egg for me.
I know that's not why you're here.
Look up this word in the dictionary.
I can't work at all with all these useless calls coming in.
Father is still in bed.
What's your favorite type of restaurant to go to?
Tom had no one to help him.
Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina.
He will be back in ten minutes.
You'd better call the doctor.
Tom told me he was really hungry.
I said goodbye to Tom.
I'm going to take you to Tom.
It couldn't have come at a worse time.
I think it's time for me to buy a decent car.
Just put it back on the desk.
They were scared at the sight of the ghost.
You didn't let me finish my sentence.
All the roads leading into the city are full of cars.
Can I say this one last time?
Tom tried to prove Mary's guilt.
Do you know anybody who can teach my kids French?
Latin is a dead language.
Our train is delayed.
Keep it in a cool place.
"For me, time is not money."
Winter is the coldest season of the year.
Would you forgive me?
I hope that Mary passes the examination.
May I go with you?
What're you asking?
Tom isn't listed.
The river is 35 meters across.
Whose turn is it to deal the cards?
I smell something rotten.
I didn't expect you to get here so soon.
I failed chemistry.
"It won't hurt, I promise."
We have no classes on Wednesday afternoons.
Don't bother me with such trifles.
May I show you something?
That's life.
"Mary was using drugs, so the police arrested her."
Tom won't go alone.
A good idea came into my mind.
You've been here way too long.
Do you have to make a speech?
Watch carefully and you can see how my lips move in pronouncing the word.
How's the job hunt going?
Tom walked into his apartment.
His child behaves well.
I'd like to drink a cup of tea.
They worked together to extinguish the fire.
You don't know what you're doing.
That book is familiar to all young children.
I'm not a psychic.
What's that awful sound?
"If you had not eaten so much, you would not be so sleepy now."
They missed Tom.
She went out.
He should be angry.
Who saw you?
My house is very near the park.
It's rather cold.
Can you recommend a good game to me?
Tom and Mary usually go to school by bicycle.
Tom walked over to the sink and turned on the faucet.
Tom has a way with words.
You're not going to get fired.
We've got something for you.
You're too generous.
The flowers smell so good.
I heard a knock at the door.
Nobody called.
I have finally won his heart.
I don't remember.
All of them speak French.
"That's what you wanted, isn't it?"
I read some books.
How did you do it?
Don't you worry about a thing.
His breath smells like goat cheese.
I will make a man of you.
I found the cage empty.
Have you ever cleaned your kitchen?
She's been living for the last five years under an assumed name.
I'm going to go find a doctor.
Why do you think that Tom did that?
"I know it's not what you suggested, but it was all I could do."
He does not understand modern technology.
You need to eat breakfast.
Our plan was unsuccessful.
No one was ever able to solve the riddle.
Did you hear what I said?
Tom is almost as tall as you are.
Excuse me for a second.
I hope not.
Your shoes are untied.
I didn't mean to do it.
I think everybody is ready.
Tom says he's thinking about getting married.
It'll be easy to finish this job by Tuesday.
They didn't keep their promise.
It took the doctor eight hours to do the operation.
Tom hasn't watered the garden yet.
Tom lost his job.
I won't go to school tomorrow.
The cake is cooling on the counter.
What have we here?
Is there a bank near here?
You shouldn't have killed Tom.
I'd like to hear a story.
What're you doing up?
"He's a man of his word, so you can count on him."
You need to rest.
I met him by chance on the train this morning.
You shouldn't try to do everything by yourself.
The people pushed their way in.
I wish my back didn't always hurt so much.
I don't want to tell you my dreams.
I thought the only thing you really enjoyed was golf.
Is Tom a suspect?
Are you going to buy that?
He has not written to them for a long time.
How did you come by that much money?
Do you feel birthdays are important?
Tom doesn't look too happy.
"He still writes novels from time to time, but not as often as he used to."
I had never before seen this species of fish.
Tom was born in Australia.
He made his suggestion very tactfully.
Beat it.
You used to tell me everything.
The first attack missed the target.
I wonder what it is like to travel through space.
Get ready for school.
Tom says hello.
Tom is diplomatic.
I'd like to go but I just don't have the time.
Is he looking?
None of these eggs are fresh.
He was sent to save the princess.
You're not allowed to park around here.
Telephone me if it rains.
Can I pick the next song?
Could you come to my office when you have a moment?
She loves to fish.
She ditched me.
Tom is a wonderful young man.
I don't want to get my feet wet.
"I'm going to miss you, Tom."
I'm fully aware of that.
"From my point of view, it would be better to wait a little longer."
How do you like these poems?
She was wearing an ugly dress.
Why are you in your pajamas?
This isn't like you.
Tom wants me to go with him.
You're three inches taller than me.
What's your favorite movie soundtrack?
He could not control his anger.
Why don't you have a boyfriend?
The game ended in a free-for-all.
Tom still has to finish painting the fence.
Who else is in there?
Let me try it.
I'm a member here.
I am too short.
He can speak not only English but also French.
You killed Tom.
My opinion is entirely different from yours.
Are you taking your meds?
God made the universe.
You're tough.
Don't look so hurt.
We're going to get you home.
Tom is sickened.
I think Tom and Mary are going to be so happy together.
Tom is really jealous and he gets mad when other guys talk to me.
I'm looking for Tom.
How long you can stand on one leg?
I'm very happy that Tom is here.
Don't brag.
This book was written by Tom.
That's more like it.
She won't be back till five.
Don't speak with your mouth full.
Tom stuck his nose where it didn't belong.
Tom would often talk about Mary when she wasn't around.
She misses him.
Can you come?
Tom always sits in the back of the classroom.
I've cooked you a nice hot dinner.
Do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Tom may be OK.
I burp a lot.
Tom never listens to me.
Are you sure his name was Tom?
I'm no rebel.
I can't believe I did that.
The privilege is reserved exclusively for women.
I love pizza very much.
She must be angry.
He left ten minutes ago.
I found this book by chance in a secondhand bookstore.
My headache has gone.
Tom is a good athlete.
I'm on vacation.
It must be nice to have friends in high places.
Tom isn't able to do his job anymore.
You can still change your mind.
"Tom and Mary were standing just outside the door, whispering to each other."
I'm just playing the devil's advocate.
Tom stopped me.
Turn to the right.
Why are you acting like a child?
Wait for us.
Tom didn't think that he was going to get caught.
Tom is making money off us.
Is your school far from here?
I'm taking a couple of days off.
The bridge is still under construction.
I grew up in a small town.
I'd like you to do the same.
"He seldom, if ever, goes to church."
I've made up my mind to ask Mary to marry me.
I get the impression that Tom is in love with you.
Nicholas Biddle began to see that the battle was lost.
Tom plans to go to Boston as soon as he can after his summer vacation begins.
I know Tom's in love with Mary.
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
I'll take you with me.
Tom and I chatted for a while.
"Unfortunately, that rumor is true."
He was too busy to notice it.
Tom looks older than he really is.
I don't like the house which he lives in.
Tom is getting rich.
Tom didn't have a chance.
What you saw was a dolphin.
Do you like Tom for a name?
We aren't afraid of death.
Keep doing what you're doing.
You're a beautiful young woman.
Fold the paper in the middle.
We've got a lot to talk about.
I have a little money now.
She was late because of the heavy traffic.
I have no objection.
He doesn't have the ability to do the work properly.
Listen carefully to me.
I asked myself that same question.
There was not a tree in sight.
I want to go to the movies today.
He woke up in the middle of the night.
"If Tom does that, I'll do that, too."
You have to believe me.
We yelled at her to be careful.
Have you walked the dog already today?
His English is excellent.
I've got a few questions for you.
Tom sat next to Mary at the piano.
Mary's wedding ring is made of pure gold.
These clothes are not appropriate for a cold winter day.
"In my opinion, it's better to change the policy."
We saw the old building pulled down.
"A man can't always be a hero, but he can always be a man."
You broke the rule.
I'm very sorry I did that.
I am going to watch TV this evening.
I will provide you all the necessary information.
I'm exhausted.
What was the weather report?
I know it's here somewhere.
They said the deal was foolish.
Why don't you take a taxi?
Your bath is ready.
We know Tom was with you that night.
He is foolish to meet her again.
I'd like to go.
"He has two daughters, both of whom are married to doctors."
Tom drives a sports car.
I do not like mathematics very much.
Notice how the player uses his elbows.
I think I can speak French well enough to say pretty much anything I want to say.
Tom and Mary will take care of John.
That's embarrassing.
Where am I going to go?
We camped on the side of the lake.
I bet you're right.
I'd rather take a taxi than walk.
We want to see it.
What is Tom doing here? I thought he was in Europe.
You sure seem happy tonight.
Are you able to type?
I need to speak with you right away.
Tom is doing well now.
The lemon is a sour fruit.
Tom and Mary spend a lot of time together.
The ending is much more interesting.
Did you have a good time this afternoon?
Let me know what I can do to help.
What's the title of the book you're reading?
I went outside early in the morning.
Tom doesn't work anymore.
I know how busy you've been.
Was that all you saw?
You will succeed in the end.
Why aren't Tom and Mary coming?
Tom is a little younger than your daughter.
We have mutual friends.
I should've known this.
Tom said yes.
Tom is sometimes late for school.
Tom felt trapped.
Tom thought he had all the time in the world.
Creditors have better memories than debtors.
We would like to buy a sofa.
I don't think I've seen you around here before.
I bet ten dollars on that horse.
You've won!
We can't pay the taxi driver if we don't have any money.
The party was more fun than I expected it to be.
Isn't there something you want to say to me?
Mary used to be beautiful.
The whole crew left except for Tom.
Both you and I are students.
He died at the age of seventy.
Both of them started laughing.
Tom says it's your turn to take out the garbage.

Can you manage to complete the manuscript by Friday?
This ought to bring in enough money to put us back in the black.

Another day passed.

Could you give me a lift to the train station?
Every one of his songs was a hit.
The problem is worse than I thought.
I am like my brother.
Why are the police here?

Tom is wiping the table.
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

You make me happy.

We hardly see you anymore.
Today is October twentieth.
I am truly happy for you.
It's freezing in here! Can somebody turn off the air-conditioner?
"As far as I know, he is reliable."

What a coincidence!
She is only a child.
We wish we could do more to help.
I assumed you would come.

We need you to help protect Tom.
I know the way.
She's open-minded.
They will find out sooner or later.

I want to see you as soon as possible.

I want to answer the last question first.
Tom told me he needed to borrow three hundred dollars.
How do I know you're not just making this up?
It's not like I don't want to do it.

I gave Tom one of those.
Tom told me he was ambidextrous.

Tom reacted badly.
This is pathetic.
Tom took off his shoes and socks.

I'll probably come back here again tomorrow.
How would you feel in this situation if you were Tom?

Can you direct me to the train station?
He gave me clothes as well as food.
Take Tom upstairs.
Why did you bring it?
She dumped him for a richer man.
"Every time I look at this picture, I think of my father."
Why are you always so mean to Tom?
Use your fist.
Tom didn't want to know about my problems.
Tom would often make mistakes purposely just so the teacher would notice him.
Who will you be coming with?
No one was punished for the fiasco.
"After Tom ate a little food, his strength returned."
I've never done it like that before.
Endorse this check.
Maybe Tom was hiding something.
Come if you can.
How was your weekend?
Did Tom find it?
"His work finished, he went to bed."
Why didn't the bus stop?
Stop yelling at me.
Tom is a good man.
I didn't even know his name.

I don't know who Tom is planning to see in Boston.
They still haven't found a buyer for that house.
Tom enjoys your company.
He pretended not to know me.
It was you that made the mistake!
There were a lot of people in the stadium.
You're avoiding my question.
He was wearing a tux.
Is it really important to you why I quit smoking?
"If you don't have enough money, I'll lend you some."
Tom wanted Mary to play a song for him on the piano.
"Because of you, I'm having problems with my blood pressure."
How long is that story?
Tom thinks Mary is really stuck up.
I live on the first floor.
Give peace a chance.
That's a little out of focus.
Fetch me my hat.
Tom was the only person in the room at the time.
She took off her coat.
Tom made a pilgrimage.
My English is not good at all.
Mine is black.
Is it true that you came by plane?
I can't believe that Tom just left without saying anything.
"If you wish to speak to Tom, you'll need to wait about three hours."
Tom wasn't fired.
We saw everything.
I hate people who say that.
Who made this pie?
They didn't hurt me.
Guess what happened to me.
We're almost there.
Have you eaten supper yet?
Come off it!
I thought about you.
Did you help Tom?
Is there anything you want to tell me?

Tom washes his hair almost every day.
We can't leave Boston until we finish this job.
I didn't catch any fish.
I have a dog and a cat.
He is busy learning English.
We played soccer yesterday.
You don't have to be scared.
There are seedless grapes and seedless watermelons. I wonder if there are seedless mangoes.
We thought that you were married.
My dog barks all the time.
I won't tolerate any mistakes.
Tom left school an hour ago.
"If that accident had happened in a city, it would have caused a disaster."
I've been tricked.
He gave me a hint.
Write in the date yourself.
The noise disturbed my sleep.
Tom got into the car and slammed the door shut.
It was a really exciting baseball game.
Stop that woman.
I'm looking forward to getting your letter.
Speaking in English is fun.
"If it were not for books, life would be boring."
They're all older than you.
I don't want to do this with you.
Why didn't you say that before?
This isn't one of my books.
He is two years older than you.
He had to work even on Sunday.
I can't keep up with these changes in fashion.
"When spring comes, it gets warm."
Did Tom notice?
Where do you live?
Are you free this weekend?

She looked me in the eye.
I would highly recommend it.
Stop criticizing me!

Read the instructions carefully before you begin.
Tom smiled admiringly.
Do you drink green tea?
Do you want me to pick up Tom after school?
Tom's plane leaves for Boston at 2:30 p.m.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
Whether you're able to speak French or not is completely irrelevant to this conversation.
What are you talking about?
Our train is late.
It was careless of me to do something like that.
Thank you so much for helping me.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
I'd suggest you don't stay longer than absolutely necessary.
He doesn't remember me anymore.
Which is the most populated continent in the world?
We can't help you now.

His job is to negotiate with foreign buyers.
He showed me the way.
Have you gotten used to living in the dorm?

Take some bottles of water to the meeting room.
Tom said he hopes that you won't be late again tomorrow.
"What'll it be, Tom?"
She has snow-white skin.

Do it the way I told you to.
He has run out of energy.

I don't believe I've heard that name.
We'll leave at eight o’clock.
Do you know where you're going?
He takes very good care of his car.
I don't have to work on Monday.
I have to go even if it rains.
"One way or round trip? ""One way, please."""
There is nothing I can do to change that.
Where's my mommy?
I watched the baseball game last night.
Strawberries are now in season.
Can you describe the situation you were in?
I hope it was as much fun for you as it was for me.
"I am a teacher, too."
Never rub your eyes after cutting a hot pepper.
I did what Tom wanted me to do.

Where can I find the milk?
When are you coming back home?
Tom seemed tough.
He pretended to be a doctor.
Welcome to my home.
He would not take the money.

It's not funny anymore.
It's raining cats and dogs here.
Give me a goodbye kiss.
Tom told me about the accident.
Please tell me where we're going.
Why doesn't Tom have to pay anything?
Welcome to Boston.
He has a lot of creative ideas.
None of your business.
I don't even vote.
They went away.
"One lump of sugar, please."
Don't call me again.
Tom said he saw Mary yesterday.
Why don't you wait until Tom gets here?

It looks like Tom is in love.
Doesn't that sound serious?
How naive do you think I am?
I'm not allowed to tell you.
I can't let Tom be put in prison for something he didn't do.
Tom got killed in a traffic accident.
Rumor has it that Tom and Mary are going to be married soon.
We aren't children.
This is a very good question.
I think Tom isn't the right man for the job.
Where's the waiting room?
You obviously don't know Tom very well.
I am sure that he is an honest man.
Everybody was very well dressed.
"This isn't for you, Tom."
We'll look ridiculous.
I don't know what this is.
She must be well off.
Tom can't help the way he is.
I knew you'd ask about that.
Is eating less meat a good idea?
You never answered the question.
What's your favorite song to workout to?
We know that she was born in Canada.
Tom appears stunned.
I have almost no money now.
How long have you been studying French?
It won't last long.
You can call me anytime you like.
I'm now sitting at my computer.
They are big.
Tom isn't my father.
The cave is easy to get to.
The only thing that really scares me is the thought of losing you.
We're not finished yet.
He helps us.
I am dying for a cold drink.
You're wise.
I can't wait.
I don't need a reason.
Nobody could've known that this was going to happen.
You lost.
He's a grouch.
The tea is hot.
Who made the rules?
That's what I pay you for.
I want nothing to do with it.
You must hurry up.
Tom is not an idiot.
That doesn't concern you.
Even Tom doesn't do that.
Tom gave Mary a diamond bracelet for their wedding anniversary.
My head really aches.
Tom seemed preoccupied and clearly wasn't listening to what Mary was saying.
You must apologize to Tom.
I don't like a world where things change so slowly.
Do you want to come inside?
Tom bought himself a sport car.
Can I help you?
There are many people who don't speak French.
Here is my phone number.
It was fine all day.
Tomorrow morning will be OK.
You're not going anywhere until your room is clean.
I'm going to take Tom home.
Look at what you've done.
It's necessary for you to go.
How long have you been in Japan?
He thanked me for the gift.
We're speechless.
Sometimes when people are uncomfortable they smile.
Tom said he was in no hurry to go home.
Are you sure you don't know Tom?
Is cracking your knuckles bad for you?
There's no doubt that he's innocent.
Tom likes surfing.
Tom appreciated Mary's advice.
I knew what you were up to.
Don't worry. I'll protect you.
Go find someone else to play with.
It doesn't look as if it's going to happen.
She fell down the stairs.
Tom picked a fight with me.
They often help each other.
What's Tom mean?
Are you sure you can afford this?
I've been working here for several years.
American troops stayed in Nicaragua until 1933.
I've been here for three months.
There are four schools in this town.
"Judging from his accent, he is from Kansai."
You can't ignore Tom.
"According to her, he will not go."
I improvised.
Tom sat down next to Mary and they began talking to each other.
I'm interested in French.
That'll be my next problem to solve.
Tom volunteered to help.
"Tom smiled at Mary, but she didn't smile back."
Tom may not know.
Tom said that he could swim well.
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
I learned to live without her.
I thought I told you never to call me while I'm at the office.
Tom wasn't invited.
My time is running out.
I like it here.
"After you've eaten, you should get some sleep."
Thank you very much for your present.
Tom doesn't work here.
Few people know about the plan.
You're fifteen minutes early.
That sounds great.
Why is that good?
Tom doesn't want you to get hurt.
What do you think of this sweater?
The road is inadequate for the amount of traffic which it carries.
I have been looking for you.
Please tell me how to pronounce this word.
The road is closed.
Tom is married to a famous actress.
Most movies are written and directed by men.
A rose has thorns on its stem.
We have changed.
He can be counted on.
Tom looked amused.
I don't think Tom has a lot of teaching experience.
"A man's worth lies in what he is, not in what he has."
Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white passenger.
There are people in the park.
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
Light the candles.
We just moved in.
Every now and then he drops in at this bookstore on his way home from the office.
I bought a VCR at that store for a low price.
What's your favorite kind of food?
The physicist was aware of the potential danger of nuclear fusion.
You are in need of a holiday.
I don't really know Tom very well.
I usually stay indoors on Sunday.
I'm glad to see you back.
Tom puts a lot of sugar and cream in his coffee.
We've learned our lesson.
"If you want a lawyer and can't afford one, one will be appointed to you."
Tom applied for refugee status.
Tom still thinks I'm working for Mary.
My favorite color is red.
The train leaves in 5 minutes.
This soup is delicious.
I don't have one.
"You didn't help Tom do that, did you?"
Tom muttered something under his breath.
"What are you thinking about? ""I'm thinking about you."""
She did not answer all the questions.
The fact is that I can't swim.
It's about time the government did something about pollution.
Tom was extremely grateful.
Is that what I think it is?
I don't know when we're supposed to be there.
Cow's milk is tastier than soy milk.
He was elected mayor again.
I hope no one saw you coming in here.
I knew it would happen sooner or later.
These pictures are really very beautiful.
Tom felt sympathy for Mary.
Tom doesn't have time right now to do that.
The time has come to say goodbye.
Tom is smoking.
I have a few things I want to make clear.
The three gunshot victims are in critical condition.
That could happen to anyone.
She went into her room to change her dress.
Tom handed Mary the key.
Did Tom really want Mary to do that?
Are you through with your homework?
"At first, I thought it was a stupid idea, but I eventually realized what a good idea it was."
They are my old friends.
This poem is attributed to him.
Do you want some company?
He translated the book from French into English.
You have to believe in something.
Mary always has to put her two cents worth in.
The old farmer did not pay him much money.
What condition is the building in?
He seemed to know everything about me.
I don't have a horse.
I don't like this one.
You can rely upon him.
A dolphin is a mammal.
I don't eat meat.
He bought a lot of flour and oil.
Are these your horses?
She wanted to understand.
I thought I'd left it at home.
Do you think I talk too much?
Don't worry about it. Everything's going to be fine.
Faith will move mountains.
Tom was reasonably certain that Mary had stolen his grandfather's gold watch.
I think we should use our time a bit more constructively.
We thought the enemy had captured you.
What does he say?
Tom has been in Australia for three years.
Have you finished what you were doing?
How stupid of me to do so!
"I understand what you're asking me to do, but I won't do that."
Tom's talents could be put to better use elsewhere.
I have something special for you.
Just pretend you don't know me.
You can stay only if you're quiet.
I do not understand you.
I will help you.
Have you ever seen a tiger around here?
It is no use trying to solve the riddle.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Tom hung his coat on one of the hooks near the door.
It was her wish to go to Paris.
He asked me if I liked mathematics.
It took all evening.
The rumor is going around that the actress is going to get a divorce.
"The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know."
"To be on the safe side, she went to hospital."
The door is still open.
Thanks for your support.
Buses are running at 20 minute intervals.
There was a light rain yesterday.
"Here, take this."
I'm all for that.
What're you thinking about?
Please bear this fact in mind.
This soup needs just a touch of salt.
Are you a good dancer?
The rain prevented us from playing tennis outside.
I'll teach you a lesson you won't forget.
What's it made from?
Listen! They're playing my favorite music.
Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause hallucinations.
It was all Tom's idea.
I've met you before.
Tom noticed a police car in the rear-view mirror.
I was just trying to impress Tom.
It's your home.
We have to use the stairs because the elevator is out of order.
I'm going to the well to get water.
"He doesn't just speak French, he speaks Spanish as well."
Everyone looked at Tom like he'd lost his mind.
I'm happy here.
He never cared much for me.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
The boat sailed across the Pacific Ocean.
Why didn't you follow my advice?
The car exploded a few moments after the collision.
"If it rains tomorrow, I won't go."
He designed the car.
Don't be insulted.
Do you have this in a bigger size?
He took her by the hand.
I don't have time now.
That's a lemon tree.
Put your gun down.
Tom tried in vain to hide his pain.
I managed to make myself understood in English.
Many thousands on both sides had been wounded.
Show us the way.
She looked as though she had seen a ghost.
All men are mortal.
Tom donated his estate to create a wildlife sanctuary.
It's too low.
She grew up to be a famous musician.
I guess I just got lucky this time.
Tom put his toys into the toy box.
Tom used to live in the same apartment building as me.
I couldn't help but fall in love with you.
The pirates boarded the ship.
Why don't you have a seat?
I had just finished my homework when he visited me.
I need some time.
Tom is a ladies' man.
Can you use a computer?
We're on a tight schedule today.
My battery is almost dead.
Is the road all right to drive on?
Tom sat on a log.
What are you going to do with your share of the treasure?
You must go to school.
It's for a friend of mine.
It has been raining since last Thursday.
I tend to look at the pictures before reading the text.
How's Tom tonight?
Is there any more of that?
My car is three years older than yours.
Tom didn't know where to burn the trash.
Don't speak unless you have something worth saying.
Smoke rose from the chimney.
You're young.
I'm a teenager.
I like the sound of the piano.
He confessed all his sins.
Tom tied his horse to the wooden post.
Tom spent Christmas behind bars.
The game was put off till next week.
Did the police arrest Tom?
I've never spoken with Tom in French.
I wonder where Tom could've gone.
Don't trust him.
You shouldn't spend more money than you earn.
Tom rushed into the office.
What's your favorite city in the world?
Tom is feeling nauseous.
She took to her new teacher.
He's picky about suits and ties.
"We all make mistakes, right?"
Could I talk to you in private?
I feel like an idiot.
Who invented the clipboard?
I'm not sure why I'm here.
Show it to him.
All Tom does is watch TV.
I wish you were wrong.
I can help you if you let me.
His dad calls him Tom.
Put it on.
I saw a very interesting documentary yesterday.
I don't like rich people.
There isn't anyone here but us.
I wish Tom would learn to speak French.
She's used to getting up early.
I hear she's a famous actress.
Tom can't afford that.
You don't have the time.
He left the company on account of personal reasons.
Three more passengers got on the bus.
Tom slit Mary's throat.
Thanks for coming back.
Tom watered the roses.
She saved my life with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Stop telling me what to do. You're not my mom.
It's not an issue.
Education is important.
Tom translated the letter into French for me.
I didn't come here to talk about my problems.
Nobody came to help me.
This book is important for a number of reasons.
What is the good of doing it?
A penny spent is often more useful than one saved.
Tom's the kind of person who calls a spade a spade and a lot of people don't like that.
I can barely breathe.
Tom fought well.
There are five pencils here.
Please don't distract me from my work.
I can't see Tom.
I just want to be a normal person.
Yesterday I was told I looked like Kohei Tanaka.
"No matter who says so, I can't believe that."
Where are your credit cards?
He is close to sixty.
Tom has OCD.
Keep in touch!
I can't tell you yet.
I came here to warn you about Tom.
Everyone was singing.
I can't believe I used to watch this show.
Tom appears satisfied.
That is what they study English for.
I want a few empty glasses.
I'm just going across to the flower shop.
Tom doesn't want that.
You scared me to death.
The monks are meditating.
Do you think that that's fair?
He tried in vain to convince them of his innocence.
Some animals are active at night.
I did everything I could not to laugh.
I'm a tattoo artist.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Tom died of a single gunshot wound.
This wall is painted green.
What's the point in doing that?
Thanks for photocopying it for me.
He removed his shirt.
He walked past the house.
Would you rather have a cup of coffee or a cup of tea?
I came as soon as I heard that you needed me.
I wish I knew how to play the trombone.
"Tom ate dinner, but he didn't eat any dessert."
"Some incidents from my childhood are crystal clear, others are just a dim memory."
Just stay the way you are.
He is the bravest soldier that ever lived.
Choose carefully.
We talked about music.
You take this one.
There's a magazine in my room.
Tom ate a piece of the cake that Mary baked.
He is not economically independent of his parents.
He managed to get there in time.
I'm glad you were there.
Tom told me that Mary died on Monday.
Tom told me what you did.
I won't be able to attend the conference.
Try not to worry about it.
He's not home.
They talked about politics.
Tom said he was glad that he did that.
Tom didn't believe that Mary was capable of doing such a thing.
There's a monster under my bed.
She ran out of paper.
Tom is almost always cheerful.
Tom didn't know their names.
Try not to worry.
That's what Tom said this morning.
I can't reach anything on the top shelf.
The champagne cork popped out.
It's a scalp disease.
Some people have all the luck.
What are you asking me to do?
I'm in big trouble.
I would like you to go home with me.
Tom doesn't care about what other people think.
"Come on, let's try it."
I'm fat.
I wonder what I'll do once I get home.
Mary kissed her husband's cheek.
I had hardly left home when it began to rain heavily.
My back hurts.
I left my umbrella here last night.
I was treated like a child by them.
Tom and Mary are playing Uno.
I'm looking forward to visiting your country this winter.
Tom is lecherous.
I know your father.
Tom wanted to find a doctor who would treat his gunshot wound without reporting it to the police.
Tom would never hurt his children.
Tom pumped up the tire.
I think I made myself clear.
Tom really gets on my nerves.
Don't disappoint me now.
Did you hear about what happened last night?
Tom gave us a lot of food.
It wasn't until long after they got married that Tom found out that Mary was wanted for murder.
The very thought of eating snails makes me feel sick.
Tell me everything you know about Tom.
Tom was screaming.
"I'd like to, but I can't."
I came across this book in a secondhand bookstore.
Tom couldn't contain his anger.
They don't like cats.
You have the advantage of a good education.
Mary is a very nice girl.
She showed me around the campus.
She tends to speak ill of others.
What's the difference?
You can come with me.
Where did you take your earrings off?
They're able students.
"Do you have a family, Tom?"
This is a terrible tragedy.
Think about what you want.
They arrived at twilight.
Sit back and enjoy it.
Tom can speak French a little.
She is looking for her missing wallet.
I do not want to cause you any trouble.
The church is still standing. Everything else was destroyed.
They didn't even know we were there.
I'm good at what I do.
You have to judge the case without bias.
"Tom, I have something to tell you."
I understand what you're trying to tell me.
You don't need my approval.
I considered Tom.
Do a little work! You'll lose some weight.
Why didn't you tell me?
Tom's family vacations in the mountains every summer.
It sounds easy.
What time does school begin?
She asked him questions.
Put some salt on your meat.
I was told Tom would be here.
"I wish I could come with you, but I have a test tomorrow and I need to study."
Tom is a racist.
"At first, I mistook you for your brother."
What're we waiting for?
Are you studying?
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He is always busy feathering his own nest.
You don't have to thank us.
I'll take care of your kitten while you're gone.
I have been studying English for four years.
Tom is smart and hardworking.
It was an accident.
The boy and his uncle faced each other across the table.
Please refrain from speaking without permission.
Tom didn't try to do anything.
Tom must be well off. He drives a very nice car.
Did you invite Tom to dinner without telling me?
I'll do it with you.
Why didn't you read the magazine?
Your French has improved a lot.
How many books do you think you have read so far?
You'll miss me.
This bicycle is mine. Yours is over there.
I don't even know where to look.
She's too loud.
"When Tom was a kid, the only book in the house was a Bible."
Can I take it home?
Tom really likes going to the movies.
I have an aunt and uncle in Boston.
"You never actually did that, did you?"
I would rather not go to school today.
"Tom's very, very good."
We're cold.
I'm not happy with this situation.
Mary is a beautiful girl.
Do you have any CDs?
It brings me great joy.
I enjoy spending time with Tom.
I'll get the wine.
I have a book.
His car broke down on the way to work.
Don't forget to go see Tom tomorrow.
That's not what I meant. I'm sorry.
I want to know.
This question isn't easy.
I want to remind you that you have a 2:30 appointment.
You're persevering.
I think Tom would make a good teacher.
I'm at your disposal.
How many pens do you have?
They were forced to withdraw.
She kicked the door.
Tom is coming to see me.
The doctor can see you at ten on May seventh.
How's the water?
Do you know what that means?
Tom was in the garden when it happened.
Tom needs to renew his passport before the fifteenth of next month.
You don't want this.
It was stupid of you to have turned down the offer.
I like to build bridges.
The bird is dead.
She kissed him on the cheek.
"To get the full value of joy, you must have someone to divide it with."
You were totally right.
Tom knows what happened.
This is a very important meeting. You ought not to miss it.
He is beyond help.
Have you ever lied to your mother?
Today's Tom's birthday.
You have to spend more time with your son.
A grasshopper and many ants lived in a field.
Have you ever seen Mt. Fuji? It is beautiful beyond description.
I study math as hard as English.
Why do you want to come with me?
Come and see me tomorrow.
Will you listen to me for a few minutes?
He seems to have something to do with it.
Tom isn't going to make it on time.
That book is worth reading.
You need to start taking responsibility for your actions.
"Drink with me, Tom."
I need a painkiller.
We thought he was an American.
I want a glass.
Tobacco was one of their major crops.
Can you tell me who they are?
You could ask Tom.
Tom was the mastermind behind the fraud.
Attendance is compulsory for all members.
Why do I have to do that?
I'm not a fanatic.
He has made the same mistake twice.
What you're saying makes no sense.
Tell her that I am waiting for her.
Where do we go from here?
"When I went to him he was sleeping, but I woke him up."
Tom poured cold water over his head.
We've run out of paper for the photocopier.
Tom and Mary gave me that.
Tom looked around the room.
"It looks like snow, doesn't it?"
Bilingual dictionaries are allowed.
Would you like to sit?
The wall is partly covered with ivy.
You need to try a little harder.
I can't just pretend nothing happened.
You should have come earlier.
Why should I care what society thinks?
Tom lived in Australia about three years ago.
He will go to New York next month.
Just don't tell anybody where you got this.
Do you live near here?
You've got a vivid imagination!
I actually don't work here.
He beat the dog with a stick.
I had a toothache yesterday.
Tom meant that.
Why were you absent yesterday?
I have a new red car.
I was hoping you might be able to tell me where Tom is.
I know where you can find Tom.
Can you ride a bicycle?
I couldn't tell the twins apart.
You have thirty minutes to decide.
Where did you buy that book?
He has made a big improvement in tennis.
My parents wouldn't let me date who I wanted to date.
Tom almost never makes mistakes.
The horse is a useful animal.
I used to go to school with him.
I should've warned you.
Take anything you like.
I haven't seen Tom since.
I am four months pregnant.
You must not eat anything for a few days.
Tom came home earlier than Mary expected.
You should leave.
I'm not your enemy.
There were a number of reasons for this accident.
The library is now under construction.
I can't understand his feelings.
Tom left the house with his briefcase.
We're college students.
Is he kind to you?
Tom has a cold.
At first he had trouble adjusting to living in his new house.
Mix three eggs and a cup of sugar.
Tom taught Mary how to write songs.
I was born and raised in Boston.
Tom signed the contract.
Tom paid the bill.
The disco is empty.
No one was arrested.
Tom called the police.
Over three hundred people lost their lives that day.
"Yesterday, I cooked Okonomiyaki."
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
Tom needs our advice.
He was wounded in the fight.
No sooner had I left the house than it started to rain.
Some employers are reluctant to take on people who have recently been released from jail.
Please prepare for the trip.
Tom is in the kitchen making tea.
There are sentences which everybody knows.
The store is just across from my house.
Let's go and see Tom.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
It seems like you're trying to provoke a fight.
Tom opened the safe.
I had a tooth pulled.
Please ask someone else.
Tom brought along his younger sister.
I have a table.
"You can't understand this sentence, can you?"
Tom's cellphone is ringing.
"When will you be back? ""It all depends on the weather."""
How do you feel?
"Wait for us, Tom."
"Tom tried, unsuccessfully, to smile."
He eats around the clock.
"Considering how long I've been studying French, I should be able to speak it better."
He would have succeeded.
Tom made only three mistakes.
One must observe the rules.
I don't want to look like Tom.
Marriage is a serious matter.
Don't tell me what to do.
You can't pretend it didn't happen.
Tom helped.
Tom wanted to spend some time alone with Mary.
This is really important.
I didn't pay.
You're not me.
He had his hair cut short.
It was a nightmare.
"If you want to keep meat for a long time, freeze it."
You are not to blame for the accident.
Please help me.
Do you want us to leave?
We always pay the same amount.
We're still young.
How many pencils do you have?
We need a doctor.
We paid Tom thirty dollars to do that.
What was it that Tom said that made Mary so angry?
Tom wouldn't like it in Australia.
Tom fell.
You're pathetic.
The Dutch were just not in control any more.
I've seen a lot of strange things in my life.
Tom Jackson's new novel is very well written and I'm sure you'll enjoy reading it.
I never realized how much I'd miss you.
Tom will be upset when he finds out that Mary forgot to pay the rent.
Lots of my friends are going there tonight.
How come you didn't call me last night?
What I saw was depressing.
The woman glared at us.
How did you find out Tom didn't need to do that?
Were you really that worried about me?
I'm sick of listening to your complaints.
Tom seems to be busy all the time.
Why don't you tell me?
Tom cried again.
"Tom speaks five languages, including Russian."
Tom heard Mary singing in the shower.
Enough is enough.
Do you play soccer?
It seems that there will be a storm soon.
Are you conservative?
Tom is a true hero.
I don't want to get a haircut.
Are you telling me you don't know where Tom lives?
I knew you'd say that.
The traffic crept along at a snail's pace.
You must be friendly with your neighbors.
You've just got to try harder.
Tom doesn't have as many friends as Mary does.
I had a stroke last year.
I crossed the river by boat.
You're my woman.
She will come soon.
I planted an apple tree in my garden.
What do you know about that?
Which instruments do you play?
He has decided not to go to the meeting.
Why don't you come on down?
Mary had never worn a sari before.
What's your asking price?
I won't do that again.
We've already eaten.
"Pardon me, but that is my racket."
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
I didn't want to look foolish.
It's not a secret.
Who wrote this book?
Please be honest.
This food is gluten-free.
Leave my car alone.
We can hear the dog barking.
Tom had a telephone call from Mary early this morning.
She says she brushes her teeth every morning.
I had hardly sat down on the bench when I found it had just been painted.
It has been raining since last Sunday.
I'm going to Australia again next month.
How long have you been in this town?
I'm just a tourist.
Fish and visitors stink after three days.
Tom's safe.
We must observe the rules.
Tom is receiving treatment.
When did Tom move to Boston?
I've made the same mistakes as I made last time.
They won't make it.
Come tomorrow.
I have to go to sleep.
He apologized to me for his rudeness.
This red sweater is cheaper than the blue one.
She is accustomed to sitting.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Please don't go away.
I don't know who to consult with.
The only thing that mattered to Tom was that we weren't impolite to his boss.
It's too dangerous.
Why didn't you bring your hat today?
Why did you buy it?
You have no idea how hard I've had to work to do this.
When are you going to do that?
Circumstances have changed.
My mother often bakes apple pies for us.
I know the boy.
Tom put up his umbrella.
There was nothing in the box.
I wish I could join you.
She died when she was 54 years old.
What you do is up to you.
You didn't answer me.
I am very busy these days.
He promised he would help us.
I can't find my suitcase.
Technically he is still a student.
Tom is out to get me.
He runs as fast as you.
Do you have an appointment with him?
Are they looking at us?
It was eighty meters long.
Did you read the ad Tom put in the paper?
I no longer need it.
Did you buy cat food?
Tom saw something on the ground.

Let's study English.
"You will pay for this, Tom."
He was all alone in the house.

We've got it under control.
We tricked Tom.

I went to your website.
She does talk a lot.

I'll show you around the city.

That's a brilliant idea.
I want you to find out about Tom.
Which is better?
I am not the person I used to be.
My name isn't Tom. It's John.
There is a fork missing.
We'll miss Tom a lot.
"I want to come, too."

I'll let you know tomorrow.
Is Tom good at driving?
Tom and Mary suddenly realized they weren't alone.
They have lived here for ten years.
I didn't know why Tom wasn't invited.
He'll never achieve anything unless he works harder.
The decision was unavoidable.
I want a jump rope with wooden handles.
How would you like your steak?
Why don't you have a look?
I know you're not doing that.
He seemed to be in a good mood.
It's a personal matter.
They were good kids.
You don't have to thank us.
You've seen what Tom can do.
Tom got here an hour before Mary.
He drives a pickup truck.
Tom ran inside.
He has a remarkable aptitude for music.
"If I'd wanted your help, I'd have asked for it."
That's all I can promise.
I brushed my hair.
Tom scratched himself.
You're not the only Canadian here.
There's a very good view from that hill.
Tom said he liked my idea.

We'll go.
People laughed at Tom.
They unloaded the ship.
He denied the accusation.
We named the dog Pochi.
I could go for some pizza right now.
I was at a loss for an answer.
Have you had a chance to talk to Tom yet?
I grew up on a farm not too far from Boston.
His mother sighed with relief.
I wasn't too sure about it.
I never actually believed Tom was a Canadian.
"Like it or not, we have to attend that meeting."
It is time to shut the gate.
Stop joking. It's a serious matter.
I'd buy a larger TV if I had room for it.
What is this?
The starving man devoured the food.
"You are tired, and so am I."
Tom isn't good at sports.
It's really embarrassing.
Why does Tom do that?
I'm not in a position to give you any advice.
"Tom wanted to impress his friends, but he just made a fool of himself."
Tom slept on the inflatable mattress.
I can't read her poker face.
I'm thinking that I should take French next year.
It's high time you got married and settled down.
Nothing happened today.
Tom went upstairs.
Tom hates these kinds of things.
Place the ladder against the wall.
Tom takes the kids to the school every day.
Tom is taller than any of the other kids in his class.
Is it hot?
Tom gave his cat some milk.
Those tulips are beautiful.
He knows this town inside out.
"He is my brother, not father."
You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
Never be late for school again.
"Even if you are not to blame, you should apologize."
You could have trusted me.
Tom looked nervously at the doctor.
Pump up the tire.
I don't feel like waiting any longer.
I don't care what it costs.
You're like a brother to me.
Tom has a terrible memory.
I just can't understand you sometimes.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
How many times have I told you not to bring people over without asking for my permission first?
I heard the children singing together.
She rejected his offer of help.
Few people have two cars.
We're all prisoners.
I abandoned my plans.
Where did you get on this bus?
Tom has marital problems.
"Tom was desperate to do that, but Mary wasn't."
Tom lost patience.
You should've been here.
It's already seven o'clock.
A boy like Tom doesn't deserve a girl like Mary.
Tom's sister's name is Mary.
You need not go there.
Tom doesn't want to go with Mary.
I used to be Tom's French teacher.
Tom left without saying goodbye.
You shouldn't have told him such a thing.
"What does the word ""get"" mean in this sentence?"
Can I ask you a personal question?
Did you mention my book?
They watched me in silence.
"She knew he was sad, but she couldn't pinpoint the reason why."
If you don't keep quiet I'll punch you in the nose.
This is the town where he was born.
Tom loosened his tie and removed his glasses.
It was so foggy I couldn't see who it was.
Each of the boys was eager to join in the race.
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
Tom should've done something.
I hope you'll reconsider.
Am I dreaming?
I didn't catch what you said.
Grandmother's ashes are in an urn at the temple.
Tom was looking for something to eat.
Please return the book when you have finished reading it.
Sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
I hope you'll be able to see Tom soon.
Tom's boat sank.
"Be careful of what you say, for he's easily annoyed."
I'm looking forward to our ski trip.
Then we went to the theater.
What is it you do again?
No one takes Tom seriously.
How could you humiliate me like that?
I'm a nice guy.
Everyone says that he's a good man.
I'm certain Tom will want to speak with you.
Tom tried to talk to us in French.
The company rewarded him with promotion.
I do not and never will feed my dog raw fish.
May I go out to play?
The soldiers had more powerful weapons.
I know too much.
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised.
He boasted of his courage.
Tom will never know it was you who told me.
Can I join you?
Have you ever read any Chinese poems?
I wonder if this is some sort of scam.
Mary looked into the mirror while she was brushing her hair.
That sounds terrible.
They fought to the last man.
What would happen if you didn't do what Tom told you to?
I really thought Tom was happy.
Have you ever traveled by plane?
Don't break my heart.
I don't feel guilty about that.
I may have made a big mistake.
Some kinds of birds can't fly.
How do I look tonight?
Let's get out of here before it's too late.
It was impressive.
Tom's the kind of person who calls a spade a spade and a lot of people don't like that.
It's going really well.
How are you and Tom getting along?
Tom was left behind.
You're starting to annoy me.
What are you going to see?
Do you know something about this?
I excused myself for a minute.
That's sweet of you.
This is so romantic.
It's not true anymore.
What time do you finish work?
"According to the newspaper, the cost of living in Tokyo is the highest in the world."
She talked to the chairman.
I can't find my briefcase.
It's been a long time.
He was eighty-two years old and feeling his age.
Did you cook this yourself?
It's too good to be true.
No one speaks this language anymore.
Tom plans to drive from Boston to Chicago.
Tom returned immediately.
Did Tom threaten you?
We have no alternative but to work.
He was completely cleared of the charge against him.
Those who enforce the law must obey the law.
Your dreams will come true.
I haven't had anything to eat since this morning.
Tom has a new car.
You'll have to learn to cook.
This book is a must for every student studying English.
Why don't you have a look?
Tom doesn't know where to go.
We have no choice but to fight.
Are you planning on buying a car?
A button has come off my coat.
Tom had a lot of fun at the party.
Feed a cold and starve a fever.
"After six games, Sampras had the edge on his opponent."
He is bound to win the match.
They liked his message.
I don't know where this belongs.
May I use this pen?
I think I can handle this myself.
I've given up smoking.
Tom has an appointment at 2:30.
Stay down.
You are the best.
This food smells rotten.
Tom ate all the bacon.
Please stay a little longer.
He is the last person I want to see now.
Tom is innocent.
Should I take the bus?
This plant doesn't need a lot of light.
I cannot read French.
"Tom, I'm in your hands."
He was absent from school yesterday.
We live in the age of technology.
He treated me badly.
Don't you want to go with me?
Can you spare a minute?
The bridge will be completed by the end of this year.
Sitting all day isn't good for you.
Has he arrived yet?
I had a funny dream last night.
My neighborhood is threatened by poverty.
This is the biggest cat that I've ever seen.
Maybe we already have enough money to buy a house.
I did not take many photos.
You should wash your hands before you eat.
I know how important this is to you.
I cannot look at this photo without being reminded of my school days.
Tom wanted to know what happened.
I'm sure my passport is in this room somewhere.
I don't feel well.
Does Tom want a car?
The therapy was unsuccessful.
I think you're right.
They are older than Tom.
He is always prepared.
It's so simple.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
Tom said he was in love with you.
The secretary is good at English in addition to being beautiful.
Do you think Tom is unreliable?
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
Tom wants custody of his son.
Some of the luggage hasn't arrived yet.
A fire broke out on the second floor.
"One month after he had become ill, he died."
We have a job to do.
That's a cheap store.
Who has it?
Where would you like to go next?
Hasn't this happened before?
"You will pay for this, Tom."
Tom left for home well over an hour ago.
Will you take this bag while I consult the map?
Tom stayed in the hotel.
Tom doesn't go to a good school.
I like to dream.
Tom wanted to know why it would take three hours.
What've you got for me?
It's not up to me.
Show it to her.
I keep a good supply of stamps to save trips to the post office.
Are you over 18?
Do you think Tom would be able to pick Mary up at the airport?
"When you said you'd look after Spot, you knew there'd be responsibilities."
Talking in the library is not allowed.
He stood up.
I want to take Tom with me.
That man was born lucky.
Does Germany share a border with Switzerland?
Please write down what I say.
"Tom told you something, didn't he?"
The car bumped the tree.
Scores of people gathered in front of the Royal Palace.
It was a partial success.
His proposals were adopted at the meeting.
He regrets not having worked harder at school.
I have to write a letter. Do you have some paper?
The accident destroyed all his hopes for success.
I'm going to start over.
I heard a young girl call for help.
Do you like red licorice?
My wife really hates cats.
It's not the end of the world.
Tell me what I want to know.
I couldn't help laughing when I heard that story.
"Those who don't want to go, don't need to go."
Do you think that this is fair?
You can't tell a book by its cover.
The ship traveled at a good speed.
Tom is wasting time.
He became a policeman.
Don't talk!
It seems that he is very busy today.
Tom managed to escape.
Tom has an aunt who is in prison.
It was that dog that bit my hand.
Why don't you tell me what you're doing here?
Some people think that the voting age should be lowered to 16.
We've run out of gas.
Maybe they can be happy.
I thought you thought Tom wasn't interested in sports.
He is difficult to get along with.
"You don't want Tom to think you're crazy, do you?"
Don't sign the contract in pencil.
I've got to get Tom home.
Tom can't stop it.
I want to know how you did it.
What advice did Tom give you?
It'll take two hours to get there by bus.
The fire went out by itself.
I knew I recognized Tom from somewhere.
She spread the butter on the bread.
I don't think I know Tom.
He kept quite calm.
Even an expert driver can make a mistake.
The ship gradually came in sight.
These things happen.
I almost dropped the plates.
Tom pulled the fire alarm.
"I've got a surprise for you, Tom."
You're three years older than me.
You're welcome to join us if you want to.
A man is known by the company he keeps.
She complained continually that there was no money left.
Tom has paid back what he owes us.
He complained about the noise.
Tom is ruthless.
No one's watching me.
You do ask a lot of questions.
She lived a quiet life in the country.
You only live once.
"No, that's not true."
Remain exactly where you are.
You should've paid your bills on time.
I do not think that she is at home.
We have made friends with Tom.
The rain didn't last long.
"Have a seat, won't you?"
French is the only foreign language I've ever studied.
Achille was born in 1908 in Paris.
You remind me of your father.
It's started again.
She said that I should quit smoking.
Paper burns quickly.

Did you bring it?

I'm not worried about it at all.
Tom was my best friend when I was in high school.
I can't believe it. Tom can't believe it either.
Don't bother to answer this letter.
All of them swim very fast.
Who are you trying to convince?
Tom is not far off the mark.
We'll do it together.
Don't give Tom what he wants.
Why are you so nice to everyone?
He went by me without noticing me.
Tom forgave me.
She wore a simple dress.
What was the response?
I refuse to be ignored any longer.
I'd like to be with Tom.
Put it onto the table.
"If you wish to speak to Tom, you'll need to wait about three hours."
Go somewhere else.
She is really a good girl.
"Tom seldom, if ever, goes to church."
Tom came home by bus.
Break this glass in case of fire.
He is either drunk or mad.
Come and join us.
I'd like to ask you some questions now.
Did Tom come to Boston with you?
Do you like going to work?
Thanks for the compliment.
I hope everything's going well with you.
"She used to keep a diary, but doesn't anymore."
I am not kidding.
"You're a good customer, so I'll do what I can."

My cat is white.
You can do that tomorrow.

My brother and I shared the room.
"Finally, someone spoke."
You are really very good.
"Tom laughed, too."
I can't delay my decision any longer.
Tom is driving.
"Without the map, he would have gotten lost."
That doesn't make sense at all.
I consider that a good thing.
Don't leave the TV on.
He was very excited.
I don't care too much for hot food.
Stay here all night if you want.
What doesn't Tom want us to see?
His name isn't Tom.
I think it's interesting.
The cause of the fire is not known.
I had never eaten sushi before.
I am just dreaming.
Tom is getting dressed.
I doubt Tom would be that foolish.

I will show it to you only once.
This is my favorite fairy tale.
The event attracted more than 300 people.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?

"When I got home, I had a nice, ice-cold shower."

You like everyone.
Who can that be?
"As far as I know, I'm in perfect health."
Now the shoe is on the other foot.
I can't just ignore Tom.
"It's your money, isn't it?"

We did nothing wrong.
I'd like to get a second opinion.
Get down.
He did it simply out of curiosity.
I'll give you my opinion.
Tom was just being polite.
I've been unable to contact Tom.
The mistake cost him his head.
Get under my umbrella.
Even a child knows that.

I didn't want to talk to the police.
He is a professor of English at Leeds.
The people of this village live in harmony with nature.
Why do you listen to Tom?
Tom and Mary didn't get along very well.
Such a plan is bound to fail.
I'd like to buy this computer.
There were many snow storms last winter.
How many of them survived is not known.
I should have come earlier.
I want to buy another one.
My wife is mad.
I taught Tom how to drive.
They may be playing in the park.
How many times do I have to say no?
Tom did poorly in his classes.
"He is getting old, but he is as healthy as ever."
Tell me about your wife.
We're not doing anything.
"To tell the truth, I drove my father's car without his permission."
Tom freaked out when he heard what Mary had done.
Tom said he's thirsty.
My back is killing me.
He does nothing but read books all day long.
"You knew Tom, didn't you?"
This pear smells nice.
Luckily nobody died.
We appointed him as our representative.
Tom walked out of the restaurant just in time to see his car being towed away.
Is that your sister?
Would you like me to show you how to do that?
Why don't you go home now?
How do I use this?
"I must pass this exam, no matter what."
What's your favorite toothpaste?
He made the right choice.
My advice wasn't followed.
Why are you so upset?
This vase is made of iron.
I'll give you my car.
I was born in October.
Tom never shouts.
You can read any book that interests you.
The old man asked me a favor.
I hope that you aren't afraid.
"You cannot have your cake and eat it, too."
It's not unusual for Tom to go to bed before 9:00.
I'm watching.
I wanted to talk to you anyway.
He is looking for a job.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I've heard a lot about you.
Nobody knows his name.
Your French is improving.
She keeps her diary in English.
Do you speak Latin?
What am I supposed to say?
I'm looking for a house.
I am going in the same direction. Come with me. I will take you there.
She was buried in her hometown.
"I want to go, too."
Did you know Mary and Alice were sisters?
I bet Tom doesn't have any plans.
I didn't want to see Tom again.
I don't think Tom is selfish.
I'll take that matter upon myself.
This needs to change.
"Would you get me a cup of coffee? ""Sure. I'd be glad to."""
The baby cried for milk.
Tom can't go home until after 2:30.
Where will you be this time tomorrow?
He worked hard to obtain his objective.
A nap would be good.
Be prepared for the worst.
That sounds fair.
Don't leave here until you have done it.
We should deal with this matter without delay.
Tom can hardly wait to meet you.
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
Tom seems wealthy.
We kind of expected this to happen.
I was wondering what changed your mind.
I don't let it bother me.
I'll leave you alone now.
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
This room will soon heat up.
Can you guess her age?
I'm surprised you didn't bring Tom along.
I worked there for three months.
It is our duty to keep our town clean.
The hungry baby did nothing but cry.
He stayed up late last night.
Tom went abroad to study French.
I don't feel like doing it.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
"Tom isn't going to do that, is he?"
"Instead of complaining, maybe you should help."
"You can't leave us, Tom."
This is a fantastic idea.
I need body lotion.
Your story wasn't interesting.
It doesn't mean anything!
She likes all of us.
This one is for Tom.
What are you doing this for?
Is that all you've got to say?
Tom had no right to treat Mary like he did.
I finished writing the report.
Tom rolled over and snoozed for another 15 minutes.
Comb your hair before you go out.
Tom noticed the door was unlocked.
I might as well give up.
It is his decision.
I think that's a huge mistake.
Honesty will pay in the long run.
Something is wrong with my watch.
She felt sympathy for the orphan and gave him some money.
They have to fix the water pipe. It's clogged.
Tom and Mary left together.
I was wrong.
Could you help me translate this into French?
"If you don't eat, you die."
You picked the wrong person.
The surface of the earth is 70% water.
We encountered a lot of difficulties on the expedition.
That's the last straw!
The poor boys were shivering with fear.
Let's go back to the motel.
He is the least likely to come.
Did you apologize to Tom?
Thank you for your patience.
The wind is cold today.
She played basketball.
They're looking for it.
"If it were not for water, we could not live."
Tom wants to know where you've been.
What were you doing out here?
Don't miss the bus.
It's up to you to make a choice.
I don't like being home alone.
"Tom doesn't know whether he can do it, but he'll give it a try."
I think now is the time.
You've barely moved all day.
I can swim fast.
Tom was in the kitchen helping his mother.
She can't have done such a thing.
"If I'd wanted your help, I would've asked for it."
Where's my bike?
She should be charged with murder.
I don't care what the consequences are.
I need something smaller.
Let's make a new start.
Tom is surviving.
Don't expect too much of me.
I caught the ball with one hand.
I like to eat.
I thought you loved me.
It became clear that she had told a lie.
Will this much food do for a week's camping?
They carried the boats almost thirty kilometers.
She accompanied him to Japan.
Tom looks older than he really is.
He wants to learn how to cook.
"It's me again, Tom."
Tom exercised.
He is too drunk to drive home.
Tom wrote a song about Mary.
Tom didn't have any shoes on.
That isn't what I want to see.
I'd like to ask Tom about that myself.
"Tom offered to carry Mary's suitcase, but she told him she wanted to carry it herself."
I'm not a rich man.
I am proud of never being late for school.
Einstein was a mathematical genius.
We need an iron bar.
Tom will use it.
Are you going to break in?
Tom often eats breakfast here.
He's an opera lover.
Tom fell down on the floor.
Do you enjoy living like this?
I'll try to be early.
There's a book about dancing on the desk.
I know what you're going to ask.
I only have one brother.
Tom didn't take part in our conversation.
I was falsely accused.
That was just a coincidence.
Wait till I put on my coat.
Tom didn't like the situation.
Tom died just as he was trying to say something to Mary.
You are one of us.
Why is it dark?
He's going to make it.
Tom lives and works in Boston.
We won't forgive you.
Please go to school.
He has no girlfriend.
Tom walked through the revolving door into the hotel lobby.
I don't work on Mondays.
He took off his clothes and put on his pajamas.
Are you excited?
His car fell into the lake.
Earthworms are a gardener's best friends.
"If Tom had money problems, I think he'd let us know."
"After the work day was over, Tom went home to his wife."
Who were you waiting for at the station?
I didn't break it.
Sit up straight.
Tom wasn't allowed to visit his father who was in prison.
Tom saw nothing.
The patient doesn't have a pulse anymore.
You are not a child anymore.
What does Tom think?
The fender was badly dented.
My uncle has a house in Italy.
You don't need to worry about Tom anymore.
My French is not good at all.
My name was called after his name.
That doesn't surprise me much.
You're taller than I imagined you'd be.
We were dead tired from the five-hour trip.
I only know him by name.
We didn't try.
This is an improvement.
I want a word with you.
I managed to find his office.
Please make way for him.
"You're still in love with Tom, aren't you?"
Tom will make fewer mistakes once he gets to know the ropes.
Do you like French cuisine?
I don't have a date.
The boy was gazing at a school of carp in the pond.
That's acceptable.
I can't figure out what you're trying to tell me.
The problem is that my son doesn't want to go to school.
Did you lie to Tom?
You should have completed it long ago.
The pilot of an airliner is responsible for the safety of passengers.
It soon began to rain very hard.
The old man served the king for many years.
"She's popular, not because she's beautiful, but because she's kind to everyone."
Keep your ideas to yourself.
Tom can't have done it.
I want you to help Tom.
You've been warned.
It sounds familiar.
Yours was better.
Don't stop him.
Tom knows the family.
A button has come off the coat.
I knew that would happen.
Old habits die hard.
You should begin with easier questions.
I believed you.
Are you actually threatening me?
Some day we'll take a trip to India.
Nagoya is a city famous for its castle.
He's thoroughly honest.
Can the report be true?
It wasn't Tom who lit the campfire.
You should go home now.
It took Tom almost three hours to get home.
It happened at a quarter past eleven.
Tom acts like he doesn't want to be seen with us.
He has made the baseball team.
Have we made any progress?
The door opened and a man came in.
He became blind because of the accident.
We like to learn foreign languages.
That young man is our teacher.
"We are good friends now, but there was a time when we didn't like each other."
We don't want to do that.
The counterfeit bills flooded the market over the weekend.
I went to donate blood today.
I begged Tom to stay.
I tried for almost an hour.
Tom is writing a short story.
I might be a few minutes late.
He told me a long story.
Has your father arrived yet?
I rejected the offer.
What are you going to get?
No one knows what has happened to him.
You need to be more attentive in class.
Tom is my dad.
Would you mind if I ask you a few questions?
Their teacher praised them.
I'll do it when my turn comes.
He divided one million dollars among his five sons.
Every morning I ask myself why.
Not all the students were present.
Tom got drenched to the skin.
She said her name was Mary.
"You do understand me, don't you?"
I'm pretty sure I won't see Tom again.
Why don't you stop worrying and get some sleep?
Can you start tomorrow?
Tom realized something wasn't right.
Which country are you from?
I leave that to you.
Nothing like that will happen again.
I'd like one more blanket.
She advised him not to drink too much.
My wrist hurts.
Why do you ask?
Let's give Tom a chance to do the right thing.
Don't make me sorry.
Ask him about it.
I wanted to make Tom feel at home.
Give me my beer.
You need to go.
I'm being sarcastic.
Tom told me I shouldn't talk to you.
A cat can see in the dark.
This is not my car.
Have you ever flown in a blimp?
That'll cost you extra.
Tom wanted me to tell you he needs to borrow your car.
Tom doesn't want to wait that long.
Tom peeled an apple for Mary.
A note was attached to the document with a paper clip.
Are you serious?
We really did try.
He got up suddenly and walked out of the room.
Stop cracking your knuckles.
It's not too hot.
The rumor may be true.
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do you find French difficult?
This car is Tom's.
"If you want to know, just ask."
He's acting on his own.
"Have you ever been to New York? ""Yes, I've been there a couple of times."""
I am disappointed.
This is one of the basic rules.
Tom knows that Mary kissed John.
I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.
Tom disappeared into his room.
Tom asked me to do that for him.
He was thirsty.
I'll try to explain it to you to the best of my ability.
It's never too late.
Do you want to go with Tom?
What does it feel like to be a patient?
I said yes immediately.
Why did you want us to come here?
How can it be?
You're a bad liar.
I suppose it can't be helped.
"I bought this camera for 35,000 yen."
My wife is a doctor.
I love soul food.
Tom is in the kitchen making tea.
This book is still interesting even after reading it many times.
Tom made a lot of money.
Tom took the day off.
I'd like to say something.
"I don't know if you've noticed, but Tom seems to have fallen in love with your daughter."
"Come on, Tom. Let's go home."
I cannot help you.
Tom said Mary is broke.
I can't believe that you like that restaurant.
"Come on, let's take shelter."
Tom lives only a few blocks away.
A few days' rest will do you good.
What're you after?
Tom has gone bananas.
There are ten thousand students in this university.
I don't really have a gun.
Describe that accident in detail.
We will visit my grandfather this week.
Tom taught me many things.
There is no possibility of the bill being passed.
I'm writing a new book.
I had nowhere to hide.
He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom almost told Mary that he loved her.
He is not a teacher but a student.
We have to do it together.
He's both tall and fat.
I am more worried about you than the future of Japan.
Your lips are red.
Do you have brothers and sisters?
I can't explain anything.
Go with Tom.
The little boy was lost in the forest.
I filled the bucket with water.
Tom turned out to be right.
I want to wash myself.
What is it you want to sell to us?
I have only a small garden.
Who's the guy over there?
Tom is the father of three children.
He didn't keep his promise that he would telephone me soon.
Tom didn't know Mary was already planning to do that.
Today is not so cold.
We have less than two hours until the deadline.
I love the sound of rain falling.
He can't stick to anything very long.
Tom is a very interesting person.
You must be flexible in your thinking.
Tom was wealthy.
Stop that!
"I just want to be your friend, nothing more."
I can't go back there now.
Could I have some towels?
Tom told Mary to stay at home.
It's going to clear up soon.
I don't have enough time to eat.
Do you mind if I take off my sweater?
We were eating dinner when Tom called.
Tom is about to do that.
I've already been working here for several hours.
Have you already started learning French?
It's all very simple.
I can't bend my right arm.
Thanks for having me here.
I only feed my dog dry dog food.
How did you do this?
The blouse is clean.
Help yourself to a piece of cake.
Tom put new strings on the old guitar that he had just bought.
That song is very popular with young people.
He gave me a wink.
Don't count on him to lend you any money.
The high command decided to attack at dawn.
They were from Liverpool.
Are you sure everything's OK?
Tom and Mary were stranded on a desert island.
I went for a drive in the country.
Tom almost lost his eye.
I'm an early riser.
There's no mail in the mailbox.
He spoke well of her son.
Don't play ball in this room.
Tom is always very busy.
He calls her up every night.
No one's in there.
This is hopeless.
I think we need more cookies.
They all envied my new car.
"English is not easy, but it is interesting."
Tom is the one who drew this picture.
Tom went shopping.
Tom is harmless.
He hit me twice.
It seems that he's happy.
I must send for the doctor.
Tom couldn't decode the secret message.
Are you possessive?
Where do Tom and Mary live?
I love solving puzzles.
Tom started working when he was thirteen.
Sweeping the room is my daughter's job.
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
I hope you're not talking about me.
I got bored and left.
Maybe Tom is just lucky.
That's an imitation.
"If you really want to speak to me, it's now or never."
Tom heard a noise behind him and turned around.
Don't pull my sleeve.
We're not as young as Tom.
Tom finally got the courage to propose to his girlfriend.
He tied the twigs into bundles.
"Which is quicker, a taxi or the subway?"
"In basketball, tall players have an advantage."
Who's staying?
We need to make sacrifices.
Ultraviolet rays are harmful to us.
I have never been to America.
The murder charge was reduced to manslaughter.
It was just my imagination.
Tom found a bottle with a note inside it washed up on the beach.
You should prepare for the worst.
I have mixed feelings about it.
"Do you speak French? ""No, I don't."""
Were they lying?
This room looks like a pigsty.
Tom goes jogging in the park every morning.
Tom didn't go to work all last week.
We have to figure out a way to make Tom do what we want him to do.
I assumed because we're brothers that I could trust you.
He twirled his mustache.
No news is good news. If you haven't heard from your son it's because he's doing well.
He can swim a mile.
Thank you for telling me.
I assemble car engines.
He dropped out of high school.
I forgot something in my car.
Have you met Tom's new girlfriend?
It's one of those.
How did you come by such a large sum of money?
Tom asked Mary about her new job in Boston.
I know a man who can speak French well.
What made you want to become an anesthesiologist?
Do I curse too much?
I've just gotten home.
Tom didn't know what to do with it.
I think you're in danger.
The policeman grabbed the robber's arm.
Tom knew a lot.
You're the best.
You're the only one for me now.
Do you want to work here?
She has very short hair.
Are you on the committee?
You said it was important.
You can stay at my house.
I felt it was my duty to come.
How did you know all that?
Read this book.
He gave them a lift to the town.
You're very courageous.
Send it to me.
She picked me an apple.
She is good at making up interesting stories.
We're not open on Thanksgiving.
What do you love? What don't you love?
Your mother would have been very proud of you.
I had a bad stomachache.
There's a garden behind our house.
I've been trying all week to get in touch with Tom.
Tom bought himself a tuxedo.
We clean our classroom after school.
"Which color do you like more, blue or red?"
We are collecting sentences and their translations into other languages.
We'll run in the park.
Did he show you the picture?
You gave it to me.
The washing machine is a wonderful invention.
Tom has fewer friends than Mary.
Can you count to one hundred in French?
Where is your room?
I'd like to be called Tom.
I can't recall when he moved to Boston.
Tom lives alone in a small house near the river.
People Tom's age don't make new friends easily.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Why do you need a new ladder?
My birthday is in November.
Whales are classified as mammals.
I want you out here.
She banged the table with her fist.
The sick man required constant attention.
"Out of twenty students, only one had read the book."
I want you.
Did you watch the Oscars?
I'm not an expert.
I don't care how much it costs. I'm going to buy it anyway.
He wrote it hurriedly.
Is Tom positive?
What would Tom do without me?
Tom has to follow our rules.
Are you afraid of death?
I will study English hard from now on.
"I don't know what Tom did to the TV, but it's working now."
It was a beautiful night.
I promised Tom I'd look after you.
Tom thinks Mary is at home.
Please don't hate me.
Poets like Milton are rare.
I'm looking for my mobile phone.
Please don't distract me from my work.
It's bigger than Tom.
The smell of food made me hungry.
The mailman left a letter for her.
"Waitress, I'd like to order."
She is over twenty.
He has a large number of books.
Don't you want to know why I didn't help?
Tom is believable.
Why are you mad at Tom?
He's too trusting.
Do as I told you.
The test was multiple choice.
She took advantage of the fine weather to paint the wall.
Are you done with your homework yet?
I am going to study.
You'd be dead if Tom hadn't saved you.
I can hear a saxophone playing somewhere.
Tom said that he wanted to move to Boston.
Where did you say this came from?
Tom is trying to lose weight.
What does Tom's new car look like?
I resigned from my position as club treasurer.
I think we should have Tom do that for us.
Hackers break into computers without permission.
I don't know if I want to marry Tom.
Get lost!
Tom told me he wanted to meet my parents.
Tom died on October 20th.
You shouldn't judge a person by his looks.
"Sit down, please."
I wouldn't have been able to do it without you.
"Come on, Tom, aren't you just a little bit curious?"
There is a library in every city in America.
Loosen up.
We go camping every summer.
Do you know anybody who speaks five languages?
Tom doesn't blame Mary for getting angry.
Tom considered the possibility of not going.
I'll have a mechanic check the car out.
"I could learn something from you, I think."
Are you in Australia?
We must work faster.
The old man looks sad.
I want to be successful.
"If you can't solve this problem, ask your teacher."
Do you understand everything?
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
What's wrong with this?
His story was interesting.
Tom already knows my opinion.
You don't look like you're having a good day.
He's afraid of the sea.
We can't simply give up.
Will it rain tomorrow?
Let us know when you find out anything.
Tom saw Mary stealing money from the cash register.
Shall I give you something to read?
He's here to spy on us.
We hardly ever agree on anything.
What's it like?
He was kind enough to show me the way to the station.
Aren't you coming in?
Tom is three months older than me.
His interests clash with mine.
I'm sorry for having deceived you.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
This is your fate.
People are really stupid sometimes.
How much money does Tom owe you?
What did you think it was?
Here's what to do.
Tom realized that he had no money on him.
I have been reading this for a few hours.
The grapefruit tastes very sour.
What you said does not make sense.
Don't look into the box.
Germany is in the middle of Europe.
Could I borrow your car?
He works as a busboy.
Where's our money?
The small dog tried to get away.
I didn't plan on this happening.
I looked at Tom.
Tom carefully cut the fabric with a pair of scissors.
Some people think it's a bad idea.
Does Tom have a tattoo?
The rainy weather lasted for ten days straight.
Try this on.
I'm familiar with the situation.
Tom guided us through the woods.
The Golden Gate Bridge is made of iron.
Everybody is excited.
You are both pretty and kind.
Please think it over.
I don't want to step on anybody's toes.
Something had to be done.
My car's over there.
This is a lion.
Nobody knows what has become of him.
Tom isn't sure when Mary will get here.
Stand aside.
Tom thought it would be a good idea to start a website that sold nothing but popcorn.
Where would you like to sit?
Some people think that advertising is a form of brainwashing.
Are you able to speak Mandarin?
Tom and Mary left the office together at 2:30.
How many shots did you hear?
Tom needs to tell Mary the truth.
I almost caught the fish.
Tom isn't welcome here.
Look at what I made.
Tom's not sick.
We believe that you will be able to make a price concession.
He has three sons.
The boy gave up his seat to the old man on the bus.
He wrote one letter.
He knows a lot about foreign affairs.
I'm making coffee.
He made me sing.
Why does this matter?
I lent her my camera.
"He had to leave the city, so he moved to Berlin."
Why are you pretending you don't know me?
How am I going to do that?
We just want you to be happy.
I'm going to tell you the truth.
He started to sing.
Tom personally invited me.
Are you sure you remember everything?
How did you come to know this?
I offered to fix Tom's flat tire.
Get away!
He got what he wanted.
Tell me the reason why you married her.
Tom couldn't have opened the door without your help.
It should be possible to change that.
Tom hates parties.
I plan to be back in Boston Monday morning.
There's no telling how long it'll take us to find Tom.
It's not a joke.
We're all right.
"We enjoyed seeing the city, but we got a little tired."
I'm going to the police station.
We're glad to have Tom here.
Tom invited me to go out on his motorboat.
Tom seems to like talking about himself.
Tom spends most of his time in the library.
That would be great.
Did Tom find what he was looking for?
The baby has fallen asleep.
How did you learn to dance so well?
She and I have nothing in common.
I'm watching you.
Do you happen to know the date of the exam?
He proceeded to the next question.
Do your work in your own way.
Tom staggered out.
Why should I care about Tom?
I read The Great Gatsby when I was in high school.
How much money do I owe you?
We're in mourning.
I think Tom is fine.
I understand this.
Could you drop me off at the library?
You'll find a job.
The telegram was a trick to get her to come home.
You're never satisfied with anything I do.
It still doesn't work.
I want to spend all my time with you.
Tom is an aggressive person.
You are in a safe place.
Have you called the boss already?
My mother cannot drive a car.
I thought I might find you here.
Do you know where you are?
My father became old.
Tom needs you in the briefing room.
I said that I would help him.
Is Tom interested?
Tom might be wrong.
You can't stop someone from lying to you.
"You are a professional, but I am an amateur."
Tom belongs in jail.
Do you know how deep the water is here?
There is no dress code.
Let's make it simple.
Tom got home just before daylight.
Is that your house?
I thought she was 30 at most.
Let's bury the hatchet.
We need to find an antidote.
She eventually got into the bad habit of smoking.
"Even though I'm sitting here in the sun, I still feel cold."
I want to spend my life with Mary.
These muffins are freshly baked.
Was Tom afraid?
Tom was famous.
I washed myself and felt much better.
He took poison by mistake.
"Like a gentleman, he rose and offered her his seat."
I can't give those to you.
I'd double-check that.
"If you have a minute, you might want to read this."
That's what I'm asking you to do.
My mother bought my little brother a yellow umbrella.
I don't know for certain when he will come.
She promised to look into the matter immediately.
We made many mistakes.
"The cop said I was going 85, but I was only going 75."
Do you like this wallet?
What'll they do to Tom?
I'd like to come home now.
Do you like to play games?
Tom has lent a lot of money to Mary.
Tom spent three years in jail.
Is that a new perfume?
"Even though Tom didn't want to go to the party, he went because he thought he'd see Mary there."
You really seem to dislike spinach.
Tom and Mary sat on the beach and talked to each other.
You're standing in my way.
Everybody knows that he is honest.
Tom and Mary are in the audience.

What Tom did wasn't illegal.
Tom wanted Mary to sign his yearbook.
I know exactly what Tom was doing.
It would be a pity if such a word were to disappear.
We can't talk here.
Why did Tom want two copies?
Tom went to Mary's house.
No sooner had Mary broken up with Tom than John asked her out.
I'd like to talk to the coordinator of this project.
Where are you from?
This rule does not apply.
I don't quite believe what he says.
They don't know us.
Fear washed across the stock market.
When are you going to see Tom again?
It is no use arguing with him about it.
Pick me up at 2:30.
"I want a television set, but I can't afford to buy one."
Tom wasn't aware that Mary had already gone home.
Tom was just about to say something when Mary walked into the room.
I love coming to Boston.
Today is my birthday.
You must not violate the regulations.
Nobody can help you.
Get away!
Will you have some more tea?
"This is your cellphone, isn't it?"
Tom has confessed.
You're my only real friend.
I assume you're talking about Tom.
There was a lamp hanging above the table.
Tom got home.
You are always watching TV.
I wanted to say hello to Tom.
That's why I like you.
Are you going to bed early tonight?
The hotel provided us with sandwiches and coffee.
Who vanished?
Tom is getting better quickly.
"They were very tired, hungry, and thirsty that night."
My favorite food is ice cream.
You're so beautiful!
I'm fed up with English.
Who was radium discovered by?
Are you really going to wear that?
The door is locked.
They stood on the top of the hill.
Most of her friends are boys.
It depends on you.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Do you have an MP3 player?
"You had a good time, didn't you?"
It is quite a surprise to see you here.
We live in the suburbs.
Tom thinks he knows where to find Mary.
"He is short, but strong."
A book came for you in the mail today.
Tom didn't need to take a taxi. He could have walked.
"Tom laughed, too."
There's a very strong wind blowing.
The people upstairs come home late at night.
We must abandon ship.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
"You really know your stuff, Tom."
Where are you from?
Why are guys so insensitive?
Atlantis sank into the sea.
Would you put on the air conditioning?
"You can have either of these, but not both."
I called Tom today.
Tom is swimming in the river.
Tom is one of the few people I can trust.
I bought this book at the bookstore in front of the station.
The law was changed.
I disagree with you.
Can you run fast?
Tom rolled up his pant legs so people could see his bright red socks.
We won't be back here again until next year.
I hate the world because the world hates me.
I get bored quickly in everything I do.
The day is sure to come when your dream will come true.
I want you to wait for me.
"After the concert, the crowd made for the nearest door."
They don't trust each other.
Do you shave every day?
Teachers must understand children.
He made a speech in support of the plan.
Why did you leave?
Did Tom kiss you?
The unemployment rate went up to 5%.
What are you saving up for?
Is your mom home?
Tom can't tell jokes.
You've lied to me before.
Do you trust me?
Tom and Mary spent a lot of time together when they were kids.
He parked his car in front of the building.
Do you really want to know what happened?
They didn't find Tom.
Are they paying you well enough?
Tom is old enough to know better.
I think it's unlikely that aliens similar to what we see in the movies have ever visited our planet.
Tom has lied to us.
Tom and Mary are holding hands.
He never breaks his promise.
You've done a perfect job.
The man who lives next door to me is a doctor.
Give those to Tom.
Tom is just about as old as I am.
His eyes failed him.
My computer makes a really weird noise.
Tom looked after the children yesterday afternoon.
Mary is a strong woman.
Tom comes from a good family.
Tom and Mary are together.
He is as busy as ever.
He will always be with you.
I'll tell the others.
Tom sleeps in the nude in the summer.
What has that got to do with anything?
"Please give me some water. ""All right."""
Don't you want to hear my side of the story?
How do you know Tom is there?
I really don't have much time.
I've decided to quit my job and take a trip around the world.
We're going to a new bar tonight. Do you want to come along?
Yesterday was the first time that Tom had ever played in front of an audience.
Do you like grits?
Tom and Mary stopped kissing when John entered the room.
There is a leak in the roof.
The man answers the description.
The first thing I want to do tomorrow is to find a good part-time job.
He ran for governor of California.
I will grant that you are right on this point.
"From across the room, you look like Tom."
She has a strong personality.
The young boy helped the old woman.
There is a man at the door who wants to see you.
Doesn't that mean anything?
Why did you change your mind?
Wikipedia is the best encyclopedia on the Internet.
Tom is elsewhere.
I never forget anything.
He treats me as if I were a stranger.
Would you look after my cat?
Have you eaten dinner?
I'll let you know tomorrow.
I can't see that far.
Tom didn't know what to say.
What do I need to do?
It looks like it's brand new.
A drunk man fell down the stairs.
Are there scorpions in Germany?
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
This is the most beautiful bouquet I've ever seen.
More and more Russian soldiers lost hope.
He left after me.
Court's adjourned.
Tom seems tense.
He went on to demonstrate how to use the machine.
He didn't carry out his promise.
Whatever we find in here is mine.
We've been here long enough.
There is no excuse for his behaviour.
My job is easy and I have a lot of free time.
Tom is very sure that Mary did that.
Let me handle it.
He was cheating.
She is married to an American.
Tom was amusing.
This is just water.
Tom is clearly in trouble.
Take what you want.
Tom and Mary failed to reach an agreement.
Men are better at this than women.
How long did you say you were in Boston?
Have you ever seen a purple butterfly?
She grows tomatoes in her garden.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
I can't go back in there.
Tell me the reason you didn't come yesterday.
He lost his patience and hit the boy.
"As far as the eye could see, there was nothing but sand."
Tom died recently.
I heard it.
My grandfather has retired because he's grown old.
You can watch television.
"Just as I went to go out, it began to rain."
I'm headed back into town.
Tom kept yelling.
My parents hardly ever punished me for anything.
Leave us alone.
It's just money.
They say there will be a general election this fall.
Do you play a musical instrument?
Tom is despondent.
"You're imagining things, Tom."
Let's start the ball rolling by introducing ourselves.
Let's get together here once a week.
A typhoon prevented us from going on our trip to Okinawa.
It would be nice if Tom didn't keep making unnecessary remarks.
He writes books.
How long were you at the party?
I know where he lives.
Why do girls talk all the time?
Tom loved it in Boston.
Is there a problem with your hearing?
He saw a lot of animals on the road.
Play it cool.
I need some of your time.
I'm beginning to regret making that suggestion.
This is a company car.
He found an unexpected way to deal with the problem.
I went for a walk early in the morning.
I hope he's all right.
He is something of a celebrity.
I wonder where Tom went.
Maybe you should take a few days off.
There were demonstrations against the government by Japanese university students in the 1960's.
Did you push the button?
What did he say?
"Grant took 14,000 prisoners."
"Regardless what he does, he does it well."
I don't like that name.
Tom and Mary had three children.
I am standing in the middle of the schoolyard.
Would you like some coffee or something?
I'm not fishing for compliments.
How can I help you if you won't trust me?
I want you to fly to Boston tomorrow.
Aren't you from Australia?
There were just barely over 100 houses in the village we passed yesterday.
When was the last time I told you I loved you?
Thank you for everything you have done for me.
He graduated from Tokyo University.
Nobody could believe it.
"We are the same age, but different heights."
She goes to the supermarket every three days.
Everyone needs to stay focused.
We paid for it.
We're not afraid of competition.
Have you already chosen?
I only had one sip of beer.
I'll take the next bus.
I don't have a salary because I don't have a job.
I'm happy for you two.
Tom left yesterday right after you did.
There must be a scientific explanation for this.
They're mine.
Tom wanted to see where I grew up.
"Hey, where are you?"
The man reading a newspaper is his father.
You are a good person.
Tom was a friend of my brother's.
Is Tom autistic?
I have the same problem.
He gave me all his money.
I think there's no point in trying to convince her.
You shouldn't stay up so late at night.
Haven't you and Tom ever danced together?
Please bring it back tomorrow.
They soon used up their food supplies.
Did I miss anything?
How hot is it?
The enemy is weak.
We're here for you.
Tom snores loudly.
Tom's eyesight isn't as good as it used to be.
We were completely exhausted from the five-hour trip.
Tom is displeased.
There are fifty states in the United States.
Tom was touchy.
Where did you get that document?
The price of oil went up.
You can't prove any of this.
It's as beautiful as you said it would be.
I cannot praise you enough.
He was accused of money-laundering.
I wish I was able to tell the difference.
"What do you think of it, Tom?"
Go through the orange door.
Who will you give the book to?
It's no good.
Tom and Mary have to get their car painted.
Tom is off doing his own thing.
They had started earlier than we had.
Did Tom make you cry?
I think he'll come.
We were ordered away without any explanation.
Will you go with Tom?
Does this seem reasonable to you?
"If you'd prefer, we can speak French."
Everyone has something to lose.
I did what you told me to do.
Tom turned the volume to the maximum.
I'm not as fond of music as you are.
Do you want a cup of coffee?
"The students are happy, but the teachers are not."
We avoid talking about politics.
There are a lot of stars larger than our own sun.
He lacks judgement.
Dragons are imaginary animals.
You must stick to your promise.
Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow.
He reads a good deal.
"Tom doesn't want it, does he?"
Tom made a run for it.
Does Tom have a problem with that?
Tom is very interested in Australian history.
I am accustomed to eating this sort of food.
Do you live near here?
That's probably a misprint.
We'd better have a talk.
She wants a serious relationship.
This isn't the knife I confiscated from Tom.
What've you been doing recently?
I love to go to the movies.
I don't find that comforting.
Tom raised three children all by himself.
No one disagreed with Tom.
I'm in dire need of money.
I can't live without him.
Tom ran down the stairs after Mary.
"If you don't want to do it, you don't have to."
"Daddy, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?"
He's an old timer.
Where did I put it?
Tom played on his college team.
When did you begin learning German?
We'll all go together.
They are my grandfather's books.
Tom told me that he got his xylophone for free.
You're a very gifted artist.
He tried it over and over again.
You're very intelligent.
I'll miss you.
Tom never even saw a computer until he was thirteen.
I forgot to attach a stamp to the envelope.
I'm trying to help you become a better person.
You're kidding!
She dialed the wrong number.
Everybody laughed but Tom.
Tom showed me around the campus.
Tom held the door open.
Mary is a girl.
What's your favorite war movie?
Good morning. How are you?
Tom calls me almost every day.
You won't get away with this.
He filled the bucket with water.
Miyazaki is not what it used to be.
She is as beautiful as her mother.
All the boys in class worked hard.
Tom used to read a lot.
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him.
"Gee, I wish I had that problem."
Tom admitted that it was due to his carelessness that the accident had happened.
I can't wait all day.
I know how to handle Tom.
Where do I come in?
Why do you want to take a taxi?
I knew Tom was busy.
That's the last thing that I expected you to do.
This is a good learning environment.
My mother looks young for her age.
Tom and Mary clinked their glasses together.
I need to feed the dog.
Where did I put my keys?
You should've come with us.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.
What makes you happy?
I've warned you over and over again not to do it.
Tom heated the milk.
Maybe you'll succeed.
I don't have the slightest doubt.
The boy fell and scraped his knee.
I'll never be late again.
Your shoes are here.
Don't tell me you actually believe this nonsense.
I wish I had married your sister instead of you.
It's no use thinking about one's lost youth.
Do you think I'm good-looking?
Has the Foreign Secretary arrived yet?
Why do you take everything so seriously?
It took four months to write a new Constitution.
Where is the Spanish embassy?
What's the most dangerous thing you've ever done?
Tom didn't know where the money came from.
"When the curtain went up, the stage was dark."
I think Tom is the only one here who knows where Mary lives.
Go ask your father.
Tom treats Mary like a princess.
Tom wants to go.
He just moved into an apartment he inherited from his parents.
Tom talked to Mary on the phone.
I wonder why Tom wants to buy that house.
I think Tom is going to be pretty mad when he finds out that the painting he bought is a fake.
Tom lives in a big house all by himself.
This is the nicest present I've ever received.
The girl wore yellow ribbons in her hair.
My right leg was injured in that accident.
I want Tom to be here for Christmas.
I'll never be young again.
I'm in trouble now.
This is your chance.
I'll lose weight.
Let's go to the theater together.
Walls have ears.
This penthouse is spacious.
I like light colors.
There are many bridges in this city.
Have you heard this story already?
That is a strange sentence.
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
Tom got an award for the highest sales at his company.
The king was stripped of his power.
Some of the books that he has are English novels.
The room looks out on the ocean.
Isn't it true?
He is by far the best student.
"I ran as fast as possible, but I was not in time for the last train."
Tom asked Mary if she thought he was handsome.
Do you miss it?
The food is cold.
Tom says he is rich.
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
The proof is in the pudding.
I could have bought that for you.
"You study French, don't you?"
Have you visited the Tower of London?
Tom wants to surprise Mary.
That's perfectly normal.
Where did the bee sting you?
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
Tom just groaned.
Tom told Mary he wanted a divorce.
Tom was embarrassed by his parents.
He did not return home till midnight.
He doesn't want you to know.
I want you to find out about Tom.
"I'd like to study French, but I don't have the time."
I run ten kilometers a day.
Have Tom come see me.
Please keep this news to yourself for a while.
"How are you getting on, Tom?"
There is little milk left in the bottle.
Maybe it was just a coincidence.
She didn't show up at the party yesterday.
That actor is both attractive and good at acting.
You're not going in the right direction.
Does that mean you'll stay?
The man is well-known all over the village.
You must pay attention to him.
Tom has a cool job.
What do you want to get Tom for Christmas?
He said that everything would turn out well.
Your room is twice the size of mine.
I like Tom's plan better than Mary's plan.
I don't care for green tea.
My neck still hurts.
Would you like bacon or sausage?
He is the right man for the job.
I've just arrived at the airport.
It is the most artistic picture I have ever taken.
You'll change your mind.
I'm tired. I'm going to lie down.
The door opened.
Tom learned a new word.
Several children were huddled around the fire.
It's what I want to do.
He teaches Arabic.
Maybe I should've told Tom.
Are we going anywhere this evening?
I don't love her anymore.
The air felt a little cold.
What are you doing for Halloween?
I'm very happy in Georgia.
Are you free on Tuesday?
She pricked herself with a needle while embroidering.
Tom emptied the water out of the bottle before he refilled it with fresh water.
That was unexpected.
She had died before I arrived.
I'm thinking about going on a trip.
Tom was sitting in the living room folding laundry.
We want to get out of here.
Is everybody all right?
My parents persuaded me not to travel alone.
Tom is smarter than you.
It's rather unique.
Tom eventually pleaded guilty.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Tom assumed Mary caught a fish.
"I love music, too."
When do I get my reward?
The world is small.
I congratulate you on passing the examination.
Are you pregnant?
Learning languages comes easy to her.
"OK, I'll give it a try."
I can't afford to buy a new car.
She is writing a letter now.
I cannot follow your logic.
He could not stand being kept waiting so long.
Tom fed the chickens.
War affects us all.
"The more we learn, the more we know."
Love hurts.
I wish I could stay here with you today.
What's the best way to contact Tom?
You've given me good advice.
Have fun this summer!
This is a Chinese fan.
I wish I could help.
Try to see things as they really are.
There's only one window in my room.
"The story may sound strange, but it is true."
The man was arrested as a spy.
"I expected to finish this work, but I couldn't."
Do you have a piece of paper I can write on?
Tom and Mary are fun to be around.
Tom said he didn't know what to do.
He writes Arabic.
"Tom has one, too."
I lost my job on Monday.
"Tom, will you stop that?"
Precise measurements are necessary.
I should take Tom with me.
Tom has allowed his kids to do that many times.
He did not come.
Tom is better looking than you.
I was rude.
"If anyone should phone, say I'll be back at one o'clock."
He's on his last legs.
This watch is twice as expensive as that one.
We ate some turtle soup.
A lot of houses were on fire.
Tom is uninsured.
Tom has a lot of things to do.
Which one do you like best?
He opened a can of worms.
We have to stop it.
He won't leave me alone.
I was a rich man.
You can't blame him.
How does this look?
I read the letter to him.
What is your mother tongue?
I'm the best.
Those are your orders.
We had fun.
What do they do there?
I negotiated the price with him.
We're planning to go to Australia for our honeymoon.
I will return your book on Tuesday if I have finished it.
Did you know Tom personally?
I'm lactose intolerant.
Who wrote the Bible?
Tom seems easygoing.
I'm just going to answer the call of nature.
I'd like you to attend the meeting tomorrow.
I love them both.
What time does this train reach Yokohama?
I nodded to show that I agreed.
Why did you buy a second car?
"If that happened, what would you do?"
Say it in English.
"More coffee, please."
Would you like anything to eat?
Have you ever stolen anything?
He has to have an operation next week.
He played golf every day during his vacation.
Tom isn't going to want Mary to do that.
Tom's father is a police officer.
I can't speak French at all.
"If you want your money back, you can have it."
She ignored all my warnings.
Tom walked along the shore alone.
She gave her father a tie.
I don't think Tom is broke.
How is Tom going to Boston?
"What are you doing, Dad?"
I'm seriously thinking of selling my house.
"Tom seldom, if ever, laughs."
I never had to worry about money.
A short movie will be shown during the opening ceremony.
Did you enjoy the movie?
You don't have to eat.
Tom asked Mary to look after his children.
Tom said he needed more money.
I want you to do that.
Do as he tells you.
He put his thoughts on paper.
That joke was funny.
My whole family's from Boston.
The cut of the diamond is perfect.
I didn't know what it was at the time.
Let me finish eating my sandwich.
The bomb destroyed three houses.
We attribute Edison's success to intelligence and hard work.
I'll never understand men.
Are you trying to scare me?
Why are you so sad?
I haven't met any woman I wanted to be married to.
This doesn't happen very often.
Tom feared the worst.
That'll be fun.
"Will you pay attention, please?"
Tom's savings will soon run out.
I don't want the same thing to happen to us.
Tom works as an announcer on television.
Tom left to go fishing shortly before dawn.
This is the biggest fish that I have ever caught.
I've been trying to call Tom all day.
We know what Tom and Mary want.
Tom didn't know for certain when Mary was going to arrive.
The world is full of problems.
She is frightened of thunder.
I could never hate you.
Why are you here?
"If it were not for the sun, there would be no life on the earth."
Why would Tom want to kill anyone?
"This is Tom's car, I think."
It is still in the testing stage.
Tom told us a long story.
Tom doesn't have to work on Sundays.
He said that Tokyo is a safe city.
I rode fifty miles that day.
Do you eat meat or are you a vegetarian?
Is this true?
I broke a bone in my foot while exercising.
Tom said something mean about me.
Now do you see?
I don't care how poor you are.
You sure seem happy tonight.
They have been reading an interesting book.
"Tom tried to speak, but couldn't."
The victim was stabbed repeatedly by the killer.
That is the sort of job I am cut out for.
It doesn't look good at all.
I converted my yen into dollars.
I gave the maid the day off.
He is the boss's private secretary.
You're too stupid to live.
I'm really looking forward to meeting Tom.
Thanks for the invitation.
Tom never was very interesting.
The custom was handed down from generation to generation.
I love French movies.
I just wanted to make you proud.
Tom has a beautiful wife.
She heard someone calling for help.
We must start at once.
You don't seem too enthusiastic.
Do you think that's possible?
I'd like to talk about your situation.
You can't say I didn't try.
The constitution was amended so that women could vote.
Leave it where you found it.
Is that unusual?
Tom followed Mary's advice.
The music is too loud.
I think I'll call Tom.
I've already answered Tom's questions.
Have you checked the oil level recently?
That's sort of why I'm here.
I can't do that.
The suit becomes him.
Tom won't like it in Australia.
Tom stopped reading.
Tom said he was happy that you didn't do that.
"A little more effort, and you will succeed."
I think you've got what I need.
Does it look bad?
Do I owe you money?
The situation has improved.
I want to know about Tom.
Why weren't you able to do that?
The committee is discussing social welfare.
My wife is a doctor.
Is this your car?
It was nothing but a joke.
The whole building shook.
Tom wanted to save the world.
"Technically, I wasn't lying."
I just want to hold her hand.
Tom seemed relieved to see me.
You probably scared Tom off.
We agreed that there was no other alternative.
What a perfect night!
She'll make a good wife.
Tom realized something was wrong.
I am very tired when I get home at night.
Tom has gone to Boston on business.
What is it?
My basket is full of books.
He went to London via Paris.
It was snowing.
I'll leave it up to your imagination.
The cats are safe.
"When Tom gets drunk, he'll eat a lot of things that he wouldn't eat when he's sober."
Many satellites orbit the earth.
She whispered to me that she was hungry.
He got up to see if he had turned off the light in the kitchen.
What do you say to my plan?
"As far as this matter is concerned, I am satisfied."
The mechanic said the repair would not take long.
What is it that you want from me?
That's not true at all.
It was partly my fault.
How deep are the cuts?
I want you to go to Osaka right away.
I don't know if I'll have time.
Today is the best day of my life.
Tom didn't know that Mary was already dead.
This material stretches easily.
Answer in English.
"Tom goes to school, doesn't he?"
Tom said he wanted to show what he'd made to Mary.
I love people who make me laugh.
I'm very glad to see you.
Why did you steal your grandmother's jewelry?
The population of Osaka City is larger than that of Kyoto City.
Tom stayed at this hotel for three weeks.
"While she was staying in Japan, she often visited Kyoto."
I don't like broccoli.
We haven't seen anyone.
Tom stared at Mary with a blank expression.
What is it this time?
He's not perfect.
Tom wasn't at school yesterday.
The disease spread in several ways.
You gave it to us.
There must be a connection between these murders.
Tom is getting married tomorrow.
Tom has some very important things he needs to do right now.
You have to find Tom.
I'm looking forward to the party.
I just saw Tom and Mary together.
She doesn't know how to swim.
No one will recognize her in this mask.
I don't know how I can help you.
I don't want to hear another complaint about you.
Tom pointed a finger at Mary.
I'm not saying Tom is right.
How about 12:45?
Could we have a table in the corner?
You should study hard so that you can pass the examination.
Politicians are good at raising money.
What do you want anyway?
Tom is one of my best friends.
Tom had a hip replacement surgery.
I didn't want to look stupid.
I wrote it for Tom.
Let's wait till he comes back.
This cloth feels smooth.
You certainly have a lot of questions.
He is making great progress in English.
This machine sometimes breaks down.
Can I talk to you privately?
Tom is too young to get married.
I arrived late for the celebration.
I don't want to become like those people.
I think I'd be a good father.
I deserved it.
I know them.
The plane is flying above the clouds.
"In those days, America was not independent of the United Kingdom."
Tom doesn't like to repeat himself.
Tom doesn't have much time to waste.
"Which do you like better, the Giants or the Dragons?"
I require your advice.
I think we can finish this later.
I'm a college student.
We watched him until he was out of sight.
I won't see you again.
Do you know where Tom is from?
You were jealous.
Mary pulled out her knitting needles.
Are you ready to eat?
That's yesterday's news.
The news made her very sad.
When was the last time you smoked a cigarette?
"If you are wrong, then so am I."
The cottage looked as if nobody were living in it.
You should have acted on her advice.
Every crime must be punished.
I'm pretty sure Tom can afford it.
My truck is parked over there.
I'd love to go out with you.
Who will pay?
Tom has one for you.
They basked in the sun.
Tom speaks French very fluently.
I am Chinese.
Their voices sound similar over the phone.
I will go.
He just texted me.
Tom saw how exhausted Mary was and told her to go right to bed.
She's the most popular girl in the class.
These pictures are amazing.
He fell ill because he ate too much.
Tom let Mary kiss him.
Please say that once again in French.
I want one!
Tom didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
Could you do me a favor?
Why don't you have a look?
I'm too tired to do study.
My plan is different from yours.
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
We haven't got all day.
I'll return home tomorrow.
I got up about six.
He asked us not to make any noise.
May I speak to you?
You're my princess.
Tom may not go to Australia until next spring.
How else can he act?
Tom wasn't amused.
Six squared equals thirty-six.
Could you please call me back tomorrow?
Why don't you get one?
He is no ordinary man.
I'm not interested in what Tom thinks.
You have work to do.
I hope he hasn't had an accident.
Foot-and-mouth disease is highly contagious.
Let's talk soon.
I want to get married and I want to have kids.
He's about the same age as you are.
Tom gave Mary sound advice.
I can't go in there.
Tom started rinsing off the dishes.
We solved that problem in a week.
Tom ate quickly.
I'm not the only one who has noticed.
The tongue of a cat feels rough.
Tom is in love with Mary.
Tom's confessed.
I wish my daughter would dress more modestly.
I hate making decisions.
Why do you care what other people think?
We go out together every weekend.
Tom ate until he was full.
Is there a cafe?
Are you going to be able to help Tom?
Tom hurt his knee when he fell down.
I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
Our teacher gives us a lot of homework.

The lake is deepest at this spot.
Children should be allowed to be children.
I sang for two hours.
Tom wanted to go into politics.
Why are you guys so angry?
"If he had been careful then, the terrible accident would not have happened."
We have to think about it.
Tom has given us all this.
I don't mind the heat.
I've been keeping something from Tom.
This is too difficult for me.
We'll go together.
I cannot tell which is the right side of this paper.
I agree with your opinion about taxes.
I'll leave it up to you.
You did what you had to do.
Tom said Mary was wrong.
My friend is seventeen years old.
It snowed for ten consecutive days.
Tom is also good at chess.
Mary is interested in politics.
I bet you know this.
She's too young to get married.
Light the lantern so we can see.
The police began to look into the matter.
Tom knows you.
Tom hoped to get a chance to do that again.
You should've left it to me.
The Federal Republic of Germany was established in 1949.
They ran through the streets naked.
I've lost a little weight.
Tom picked Mary up and put her in her highchair.
Traffic accidents happen every day.
Can you slow down a little?
Would you like to know how I did that?
Who does your decorating?
Do you think your spouse spends enough time with you?
Are Tom and Mary twins?
I'm very proud of you.
You don't seem to understand anything.
I know that you and Tom are friends.
He is one of Spain's most famous authors.
Did Tom actually do that in less than three hours?
I'm not saying it's impossible.
Don't tell me how to raise my children.
"Is this yours, Tom?"
Tom hoped that Mary would say yes.
That's why I don't like Tom.
Tom is still a little boy.
They say they know you.
I waited for her a long time.
President Madison signed the bill into law.
You've grown fat.
He went to the shop.
The economy of Japan is still stable.
Will you accompany me?
"Tom is three years older than I am, but he's shorter than I am."
The strong earthquake in Hokkaido caused extensive damage.
I have no idea how Tom must feel.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
Can you order it for me?
You can't exactly blame Tom for what he did.
Tom loves soccer.
Tom handed me a piece of paper with his address written on it.
They were sleeping.
His novel was translated into Japanese.
We need this.
Where's your drink?
We are spending the night at my uncle's house.
He is nothing but a liar.
Would you like to come over to my house?
"If I told you, you wouldn't understand."
I miss it.
"I'll do it, too."
Tom doesn't know what's bothering Mary.
I have just been to the station to see my uncle off.
I don't know if I can ever trust you again.
There is a monster under my bed.
Don't you like Tom?
It might just be a coincidence.
Do you know how to pronounce this word?
He slept well last night.
"You have no idea what happened, do you?"
That discovery was quite accidental.
He was irritated by her delay.
Why are you staring at me?
You are a beautiful butterfly.
Please add up the numbers.
I can look after myself.
Did you go to London that day?
Mary asked Tom to zip up her dress.
That ended better than I expected.
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.
May I have a look at it?
I'm going to be OK.
Tom didn't tell me you were here.
The customer is always right.
Who was invited to the party?
Aren't you helping Tom?
Lincoln welcomed his old political opponent.
I want to go swimming with a friend.
Young people should respect their elders.
It's more difficult than you think.
He just wants attention.
"Be quiet, all of you."
He had more than enough money.
They nodded to each other.
"I complained, but they refused to take this sweater back."
When did you find this?
Tom won't get here until 2:30.
Tom lost all his money.
You're an idiot.
"While in London, he visited the British Museum."
Tom looked up at the stars.
No one could solve the problem after all.
This is a map of the city of Sendai.
You never trusted me.
We're still together.
It's raining cats and dogs.
How long have you been dating?
Tom was awarded a research grant by the National Science Foundation.
You should keep your promise.
Why do you walk when you have a car?
Please be patient.
Did you see the accident?
When did he go?
"Last year, I saw at least fifty movies."
My neighbor is planting new grass in his yard.
My colleague and her husband are both American.
Please put it back in its place.
Do come to the party.
I thought you enjoyed talking about baseball.
All I know is that he came from China.
You can't blame Tom for doing what he did.
It looks like Tom won the race.
I wanted to learn from the best.
She wasn't a bit impatient.
I won't be coming to school anymore.
Yesterday was hot.
You're only three years older than me.
Tom fell down the stairs and hit his head.
Tom always wears fashionable clothes.
The bank loaned the company one million dollars.
A bright red ladybug landed on my fingertip.
That's quite possible.
All essays must be handed in on time.
I bought her a nice Christmas present.
You know I hate spinach.
"Tom had so much he wanted to say, but not enough time to say it all."
Don't read my diary.
I don't want Tom to hear about this.
I never think about it anymore.
"When I was your age, I had a job."
Mary has the most clothes of all her friends.
Will you help me prepare for the party?
My brother is holding a camera in his hand.
I knew what Tom meant.
Please close the door.
She sent me a long letter.
I want to do it myself.
The three of us spend a lot of time together.
"By the time you get home, all the cherry blossoms will have fallen."
What do we owe Tom?
Tom and Mary went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Smoking is forbidden in this area.
I'll lend it to you.
"Tom tried to make Mary happy, but he couldn't."
Please show me how to use the headset.
I know you're in there.
Does Tom like you?
I'm sorry to see Tom go.
He's racking his brains over how to deal with the matter.
We'll take it.
Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish.
It's too far away.
What a strange story!
I got married yesterday.
Why is my dad in the kitchen?
They just don't trust you.
I do not like science.
I am on duty now.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Tom got these tickets for free.
"Get to it, Tom."
Tom knows where Mary went.
Tom and Mary rearranged the furniture in their living room.
I want this photograph developed as soon as possible.
He stuck to the original plan.
I'm certain that he'll come.
You'd better not tell anyone.
Why are you so late?
Tom works in Boston.
Do I want to be able to continue working as a teacher?
I wonder what this phrase means.
We wrote to each other.
How was school today?
Something must be done immediately to deal with this problem.
Whose friend is he?
Lambs are baby sheep.
Tom isn't losing.
I want you to go home.
Tom got expelled from school.
It is time you got married.
She accumulated a fortune by investing wisely.
I have a brother.
Tom and Mary were sure they could do what John asked them to do.
This was the most interesting book that she had ever read.
Who does the gun belong to?
Nobody will know.
I can't remember your name.
I saw you crying.
Look what you've done to me.
Get out of my house.
Tom asked Mary to sit down for a while.
We'll take a look.
I wish you'd come sooner.
It's nice and cool.
This book looks interesting.
I love soul food.
My joints ache when it gets cold.
Tom insulted Mary.
Who were you there with?
Do you have any idea what's wrong?
Neither of us can speak French.
Do you think Tom is lying to us?
I don't know if you remember me.
Texting while driving is very dangerous.
I'm glad she liked him.
I've never seen anything more beautiful in my life.
"Tom shouted, ""There's a fire!"""
It isn't worth repairing this car.
I didn't know you were superstitious.
I'll help you pack.
This meeting room has three doors.
When was the last time you got drunk?
How many people are on your team?
I don't dream.
School is boring.
My brother is older than me.
She reserved a room.
"Sing the song once more, please."
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're very good at what you do.
Her ring fell into a river and sank to the bottom.
My seat is near the door.
That's my CD.
Tom abused our trust.
Your answer doesn't make sense.
My mother is making a cake.
The man passed by without so much as glancing at her.
I should've gotten up earlier this morning.
How did you train your dog to come when you call him?
Tom and Mary are older than John.
I talked to Tom just the other day.
I don't plan on telling Tom anything.
He refused to pay.
What are you good at?
A fire broke out during the night.
Did you have a good meal at that restaurant?
That's what makes me happy.
There is no telling what he is thinking.
I thought you wanted to wait.
I am like my father.
Both of them are busy.
How about going out to eat tonight?
Anyone who says so is a liar.
I want to know who broke this window.
They spoke too quickly for me to understand.
"You were very busy, weren't you?"
Do you have a wife?
I'm wounded.
Tom is a married man.
My bag was stolen.
The tactic worked.
We do not know her.
Tom is a very loving person.
My uncle can speak German.
We're not crazy.
I like the way you walk.
Why don't you come over here?
Give me my glasses.
"Fortunately, I have a green thumb."
I don't like people staring at me.
Lincoln was a Republican.
I'm sorry that I haven't been able to be here for you.
What would I do without you?
She's busy now and can't speak to you.
We're running out of gas.
They're having a party in the apartment upstairs.
She intended to withdraw all her savings from the bank.
"I'm going to get myself something to drink. Do you want something, too?"
They'll kill me.
Will you lend me your pencil?
Our soccer team has a good defense.
Tom is our next door neighbor.
Tom may come.
They're there alone.
Tom loves Mary. I know he does.
Tom won't wait.
We expect that to happen.
I think you know that's inappropriate.
You will fail unless you work harder.
Are the preparations for tomorrow complete?
I'm tied up now. Could you make it later?
She looked him in the face.
I was able to do that much quicker than Tom.
I've found Tom.
He was alone.
Spring is drawing near.
Tom just wanted to say thanks.
That's the best concert I have ever been to.
"To loosen a screw, turn it to the left."
Please hurry up!
Our dog buries its bones in the garden.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
Tom shot himself in the leg accidentally.
Does Tom still wear glasses?
It could just be your imagination.
What's the weight of your suitcase?
You don't have to study.
This problem is too difficult for primary school children to solve.
Tom sounded upset.
Tom is extremely unfriendly.
I heard someone whistle.
"Tom, I want to go to sleep."
I feel bad about not having gone to his funeral.
"Once upon a time, there lived a poor man and a rich woman."
I'm just trying to understand you.
His son became a famous pianist.
I'm counting on you.
I met her on my way home.
I awoke to find myself famous.
I have an open ticket to Osaka.
I'll foot the bill.
Don't you feel the house shaking?
Don't make fun of old people.
That's for you to do.
He doesn't have the time to play cards.
The film was a great success.
At last he reached his goal.
How could you be so cruel?
Don't worry about making mistakes.
Tom decided.
He has no family to support.
It was more expensive than I expected it to be.
Leave Tom alone.
I had my wallet stolen on the bus.
Do you still want me to give Tom your old computer?
Tom and Mary became good friends.
You can still change your mind.
The fridge is empty.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I own this car.
Can you show us the house?
Tom came by earlier.
I don't have any other option.
We're coming to get you.
You're a really bad listener.
I have a date.
Mary helped her mother cook.
The lid is closed.
How did you first meet Tom?
Mary is too young for me anyway.
"You make good money, don't you?"
Slip on your shoes.
We all mourned for the people killed in the accident.
I'm a housewife.
Did I touch a nerve?
I am wasting my time.
Why are you giving me money? That's not normal.
Tom tells it like it is.
Tom walked quickly down the corridor.
I wish she would stop smoking.
The only thing that I know for certain is that I exist.
Are you seriously suggesting that Tom is from another planet?
I couldn't wait to talk to Tom.
She went from one shop to another.
I know a lot about you.
Don't you want to be here?
I like being in Boston.
Camels are often used to travel in the desert.
I prefer to write in French.
Everything is done by hand.
Tom is the only student at this school that Mary knows.
Can he see us?
Tom was buried yesterday.
Tom has a lot of confidence in himself.
I speak French as well as she does.
We're in Boston.
We see with our eyes.
Stick to your plan.
That's a direct order.
Tom asked me to do that for him.
I wish I had gone to the theater last night.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't like chocolate?
You should have paid attention to her warning.
She can't bring herself to throw away photo albums filled with memories of him.
My father took me to a movie last night.
My cat likes to look through the window.
"Two tickets, please."
Tom said that he didn't want to be disturbed.
The actress tore up her contract angrily.
Please take off your shoes.
Tom will be back home soon.
She is a fluent speaker of English.
"Fortunately, they were able to escape."
There have been several cases of infantile paralysis.
They are using a telescope to look at the sky.
I have a slight fever today.
They aren't my books.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
No one speaks with me.
I hope you're having fun.
How old is he now?
Do you have any money left?
Can you do me a favor?
I'm not a student.
Thank you for watching.
I won't forget this.
I don't want you to make the same mistake I made.
"Before I get out of bed, I spend a little time thinking about what I'll be doing the rest of the day."
Tom is too busy to see you at present.
I'm looking for my key.
"You don't want me to miss my bus, do you?"
My brother speaks very fast.
We depend on you.
I don't want her.
I can't give it to you.
We have three airplanes.
I slapped him.
I want popcorn.
That's certainly an interesting question.
Have you spoken to your parents about this?
We're very proud of you.
It's my birthday soon.
Let's go back to Australia.
I have to be there before seven.
I ate too much yesterday.
He is skating.
What train you are going to take?
"When should we tell Tom this? ""Now is the best time."""
Tom stopped talking and began to eat.
How can I explain this?
I want a direct answer.
Tom gave up his teaching job to become a full-time studio musician.
There is no other way.
You're going to get us all in trouble.
The days are becoming shorter.
"You can't swim, can you?"
I swear I'll make it up to you.
It's every man for himself.
Tom certainly wouldn't be pleased if Mary decided to go back to work.
Tom worked as a teacher and journalist.
Who'd you invite?
That boat was full of refugees from Cuba.
Tom looks anxious.
Tom never used to eat so much junk food.
I don't think Tom will notice.
Tom is a troublemaker.
Tom helped us do that.
Why should I be scared?
I love being alone.
Have any letters arrived for me?
It's not there.
Don't forget to send the letter.
The toilet is stopped up.
Tom only has a slight foreign accent.
"Tom can remember the chords to the song, but can't remember all the lyrics."
I'll get Tom to do that for us.
Tom looks shaken.
Tom was there before anyone else.
I wonder why Tom doesn't like me.
I suggest we take the stairs.
Did you know my father?
The Queen's crown was made of gold.
Tom and Mary have nothing to eat.
I couldn't put up with his rudeness.
I want to talk to you for a minute about Tom.
I always tried to be strict with them and not to smile.
I'm waiting for her to climb into her car.
Tom is having a hard time deciding what to wear to the party.
Who destroyed the garden?
Did you speak to Tom?
They are wrestlers.
Tom and Mary miss John.
He suggested that we should put off our departure.
You must judge for yourself.
Why did you buy flowers?
Let me deal with him.
Our teacher is fresh out of college.
You seem to be in a bad mood today.
This child's very naughty.
It was a contemptible thing to do.
Your grandfather is very charismatic.
I wish I were in Paris now.
Have you ever been to the Black Sea?
What is he after?
"No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't remember that song's title."
He cannot answer their questions.
Tom decided that it wasn't necessary to deal with that problem this afternoon.
Am I going to be OK?
I know some of these girls.
I'm calling because I've lost my credit card.
She never told me she had a cat.
They're doing it now.
The document bore his signature.
"In the summer, it is very hot here."
The ball rolled across the lawn.
Did Tom speak French to you?
He lives within earshot of my house.
Tom picked up the broken pieces of glass off the floor.
I do that every week.
Do you understand what you have to do?
It's right above you.
I eat rice every day.
Maybe I shouldn't tell Tom what Mary did.
It's rare for me to get invited to parties.
I decided to try again.
I only want to help Tom.
Tom is a real nuisance.
Do you remember who I am?
A leaf is falling.
I want to know what it is.
You don't look so good.
Tom crossed the street.
Tom wanted to wait for the next bus.
What do you think is the best way to defuse their argument?
Why didn't you wake me?
Do come in!
Tom often came here as a student.
Zurich is considered to be a major financial hub.
You don't look very good.
There's something wrong with Tom.
Turn the volume up.
You and Tom are made for each other.
Tom kissed Mary in front of everyone.
Is that from Tom?
You're not young anymore.
Everybody in the village knew him.
He is better today than yesterday.
Push all the desks back against the walls.
Tom often puts cinnamon in his coffee.
You make me smile.
This is quite new to me.
"I can give you a copy of the report, but I can't vouch for its accuracy."
Three beers and a tequila please.
You don't have the time.
I didn't want to get up early.
"Tom is very sharp, isn't he?"
Tom was expelled from private school.
This was too difficult a problem for her to solve.
I had to have Tom rewrite the report.
Doing homework is extremely boring.
"Is this to eat here, or to go?"
They forgave you.
Have you already eaten breakfast?
The prosecuting attorney can't prove that somebody else didn't do it.
Why were you looking for Tom?
I will never make such a mistake again.
We still have more than halfway to go to get to the top of the mountain. Are you really already exhausted?
I donated blood this afternoon.
That sounds like a good idea.
We're the same age.
You'll need a special tool to do it.
Keep reading.
It was time to leave.
Why do you always do that to me?
It is in the kitchen.
To love life is to love God.
Don't listen to Tom.
"Tom, who was adopted at birth, only met his biological mother for the first time a few weeks ago."
I live within 200 meters of the station.
Could you help me when I move?
Don't ever give up hope.
Do Tom and Mary know why you're here?
You've both been very helpful.
Tom doesn't think Mary can live without him.
We've all done that.
Let's go somewhere else.
He's a devout Catholic.
He has been sick in bed for a week.
Could you help me out here?
What's this hotel's fax number?
It's a rule.
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Water consists of hydrogen and oxygen.
Birds are singing in the trees.
Is there snow on top of the mountain?
He is afraid of his father.
Some students find it difficult to follow the rules.
Tom isn't as healthy as he used to be.
I was fifteen years old in this picture.
We're out of butter.
Nothing is more pleasant than to take a walk on a fine spring day.
You can sleep here if you want.
How about calling it a day?
I don't have to worry about that kind of thing anymore.
Do you want to sit?
He thinks that his success is due to luck.
"I have a stomachache, doctor."
Do you have any one dollar bills?
Tom looked around to see if anybody was watching.
Tom said that he feels like going out.
Talk to Tom and see what he thinks about this.
All the bank robbers were wearing masks.
Tom lives on the third floor.
Tom isn't hopeful.
I'm not complaining.
The reporters continued to ask questions.
Tom said Mary may do that.
"As soon as work is over, he makes a beeline for the pub."
I'm writing a letter.
"Frankly speaking, I don't like the idea."
You can lean on me.
How do you think Tom is doing?
It was five days after she graduated that my daughter left Osaka Airport for Germany.
Tom had no idea what Mary was talking about.
I feel like someone is watching me.
It's incredible.
I'm going to miss that.
The cause of the accident is still not clear.
We're going to have a baby.
Who's your favorite poet?
It's strange that this isn't working.
"What would you do in a situation like this, Tom?"
Tom ate all his meals in his room.
Do you enjoy losing?
He took a big risk.
That topic is worth discussing.
Nobody noticed me.
Tom lowered his voice.
Tom must decide what to do right away.
She may not come.
You must overcome the difficulties.
Tom comes here every single day.
What time's your train?
Where is your cap?
Do you know each other?
Tom blames you for the death of his wife.
Tom ended up going by himself.
Tom was one of the most handsome young men Mary had ever seen.
Tom could barely keep up with Mary.
Do you know where Tom is going?
Do you know why the sky is blue?
Tom is a little over thirty.
Didn't you ask Tom if you could borrow some money?
I don't want you two talking about me.
"People keep saying that she's beautiful, but really, she isn't."
You're doing fine.
How long have you lived in Boston?
I have lots of things to do.
Sudden decrease in appetite is sometimes a sign of illness.
I'm seeing you in a new light.
Why is my Internet connection so slow?
The usual business hours in this office are from nine to five.
I thought about it.
Excessive concern with safety can be dangerous.
My friend is seventeen.
How could I help you?
Aren't you happy?
It only took Mary a few minutes to set the table.
I don't want to do that for Tom.
Were you able to solve the problem?
I knew you wouldn't forget Tom.
This is no good.
Tom had never been to Boston before.
"I'll come, too."
Are there any other questions?
The soldiers march in camouflaged uniforms.
"Once we start reading a book, we should read it all the way through."
Tom got off the train.
He was sitting on a bench.
Tom looked very tired when he got home.
How many hours a day do you study French?
Where's the bank?
Why is Tom being so generous?
You barely touched your food.
Her mother is a most beautiful woman.
Play outside instead of watching TV.
You'd better call the doctor.
I've seen Tom.
But how does this story end?
Have a nice day.
He was at the bottom of the class.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
The man dashed the bottle against the wall.
What did you buy for your boyfriend?
Do you know anyone who was on that ship that sunk?
Tom thought we should leave early.
Tom is a wonderful guy.
Have you ever been to France?
I shouldn't have been driving.
Tom can understand you.
All of us live in the same dorm.
Don't you like this?
Do you want another one of these?
I now know why Tom did what he did.
What is it you'd like me to do exactly?
"Couldn't we cuddle, instead?"
It wasn't a party.
Tom's dog swims quite well.
I want this matter taken care of immediately.
He always ate fruit for dessert.
I have good reasons for hating Tom.
He looks down on everybody else.
Tom doesn't have to thank us.
I feel like I know you.
Can you translate this for me?
Tom isn't stable.
Did you call?
Tom isn't the best person for the job.
The toilets are behind the stairs.
My mother left home ten minutes ago.
Tom wants to learn.
I serve no one.
Just apologize.
"Tom isn't here, is he?"
He's very angry with you.
Can I talk to you about something personal?
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Peel the apple before you eat it.
We have a big supermarket.
It's hard to get people to change.
What if Tom and Mary don't want to do that?
I'm having dinner now.
I love the sound of children laughing.
Send the bill to me.
What is it you want from me?
Do you want to watch this program?
I'll remember you forever.
Is that your new boyfriend?
"Drive more carefully, or you will have an accident."
Don't you want to have kids of your own?
Tom has a cough.
I think this novel shows the author at his best.
Copying is not theft.
Does she have a boyfriend?
Tom is making jam.
The lawyer's job is to prove that her client is innocent.
It appears to me you are mistaken.
I don't tolerate incompetence.
Tom came to Boston when he was thirteen years old.
I said good night to my parents and went to bed.
He made such a long speech that we all got bored.
He's a successful businessman.
He stamped out a fire.
"I was looking for Tom, but he found me first."
The population of Japan is much larger than that of Australia.
I'd like to make a reservation to play golf tomorrow.
What's wrong with Tom?
She sat next him with her eyes closed.
He is tired of reading.
I didn't know you had a cat.
People struggled against poverty.
Is it too salty?
How sick is Tom?
That goes without saying.
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
He plays baseball every day.
They're not criminals.
Did Tom go home?
I've got something important to tell you.
Tom wanted to say more.
It'll be hard to convince Tom to help us.
He was framed on a murder charge.
Tom got cheated.
The boy took no notice of his father's advice.
I tripped over a stone.
You thought I wouldn't notice?
I'll bet Tom will know what to do.
I shouldn't have said that.
"We shouted for help, but no one came."
Did you sew this by hand?
I am familiar with this computer.
He managed to be on time for class.
That's not the problem.
I'm free all afternoon on February 27th.
Their marriage broke up last year.
No one can know everything.
I pretended that I didn't understand.
Culture is what remains after one has forgotten all the things one has learned.
They are looking into the problem.
Nobody even noticed.
My knife is broken.
We had a very good time at the party.
I had hardly started to work when it began to rain.
Tom is good at that.
You don't need to answer that question.
Tom had a bright idea.
Who's that guy in the painting?
"I didn't go, but stayed at home."
Tom lit the candles on the cake.
Why are people afraid of Tom?
You had better not stay up late.
I love your name.
My New Year's resolution was to lose weight.
You have a secret admirer.
They suddenly appeared from nowhere.
You did well not to follow his advice.
He mentioned in passing that he intended to get married.
You could've asked me.
I think it strange that she didn't say anything.
This sounds familiar.
I filled the pool with water.
Has Tom paid the rent?
Tom is a hard worker.
Tom will never believe that.
Tom told me that he was disappointed.
Stars twinkled in the sky.
Are you dreading this as much as I am?
They talked about culture.
Tom ripped up the letter.
We're not going to stop here.
Sometimes that happens.
His careless driving caused the accident.
I wonder what Tom is doing now.
How long have you lived in Sanda?
Tom was third in line.
I thought I'd never see you again.
The bill amounts to 500 dollars.
You can't defeat me.
"Tom does that, but Mary doesn't."
Tom always arrives early.
We go fishing together once in a while.
He has left his family.
The architecture in this part of the city is ugly.
Tom likes it there.
I hate this school.
The mother lay beside her baby on the bed.
Tom isn't family.
The movie theater was empty.
We did the best we could.
We'll do it tomorrow.
"I'm sorry, but I already have a boyfriend."
It's for your own good.
What a bizarre tale!
I thought Tom would meet Mary.
Is this what you wanted?
I'm not saying why.
She tore a hole in her dress.
I'm going up the stairs.
You signed a confession.
I think you'll like it.
"While I was waiting for the streetcar, I witnessed a traffic accident."
What he said yesterday is not true.
We've got to take care of it.
"It's not a road, but a path."
Call me.
There are ducks on the pond.
That was a big surprise.
It gets cold here at this time of the year.
"If you follow this street, you will get to the station."
A fire broke out near my house.
You had better go there in decent clothes.
Where's the pan lid?
You'll be very sorry.
Is it OK to do that here?
That would take about three minutes.
"When I was a kid, I remember my mother used to stay awake all night waiting for my older brother to come home."
You can have my sandwich.
Both my father and my brother are fond of gambling.
If only I had a pretty dress like that!
Your O's look like A's.
Give me the keys.
I hate watching TV.
Hit Tom.
I was busy.
This is simply not true.
Can you tell me what this is?
The horse chafed at the bit put in its mouth.
I didn't hear you knock.
How long did you stay in Boston?
It will not be long before spring comes.
The peace talks ended in failure.
I don't hear anything.
Where's my lawyer?
They just don't trust you.
We were looking forward to spending an evening at home alone.
There's an old movie theater in town.
I feel guilty.
Did you say 30?
I thought you'd stopped dating Tom.
I wonder if exchange students can join this club.
He has a second job.
He wrote a lot of books on China.
Is Tom good?
Tom lost the bet.
Should I wait for Tom to finish?
There were twenty or so people there.
I can't believe that I'm really here.
I can scarcely sleep at night.
A dog was run over by a truck.
The dream has become a reality.
The pink pillow is clean.
Tom thought Cookie would be a good name for his dog.
What does a stamp for a postcard to Germany cost?
Is this your first visit to Japan?
Forget your troubles for a while and come and have dinner with us.
I'll feed the dog.
Tom called Mary a traitor.
What's today's menu?
Tom asked if Mary was married.
I still have time.
They were the first to get into the bus.
I'm dying to see you.
No final decision has been made.
I'm beginning to think you're right.
This apartment is bigger than any other one in the building.
I looked around me.
Mary was wearing a red and white dress.
Do you like folk music?
The Jacksons are going with us.
My heart goes out to you.
Do you know the family?
How can this be?
I don't think we're welcome here.
I see your cat in the garden.
We are Australians.
Everybody makes mistakes.
I'm going to be gone by the time you get here.
It was found at the bottom of the river.
I don't like that anymore.
See that the door is locked before you leave.
The goods arrived yesterday.
I've told you everything I remember.
There was nothing Tom could do to help Mary.
It's the truth.
It sounded easy.
Soccer is more popular in Japan than it used to be.
This decision is final.
I will go when they come back here.
It was a pleasure working with you.
"If you want, you can go."
Tom wants to change the world.
The part of an iceberg under the water is much larger than that above the water.
May I have a look at that?
Tom has granted me an interview.
I haven't lied to you.
Your book is on the desk.
Did you shoot Tom?
Do you hear something?
You must go outside if you want to smoke.
We've looked everywhere.
"Instead of waiting for a contract, we can handle it over the phone."
Tom collects comics.
That suitcase isn't theirs.
Dr. Hawking had almost finished writing a book.
Spanish is easy.
"She still hated him, even after he died."
She was sitting there with her eyes closed.
"Austria had allies, too."
Do you hear something?
I'm incredibly tired.
I like my house.
"Tom didn't feel very well, but he went to work anyway."
He declined my proposal.
Why are you wearing those clothes?
Will you take me there?
I just received a message that the meeting has been canceled.
Please drop me off at the station.
Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
You sound a lot like Tom.
I figured you might be hungry by now.
Why did you listen to them?
I know you're disappointed in me.
What am I going to say to Tom?
I bought it yesterday.
Is there anything else that needs to be done?
Whales are mammals.
I still dream about it.
Tom has thinning gray hair.
Can you forgive me?
Come closer to the fire if you're cold.
I should've quit smoking a long time ago.
Take a bus.
Please call him.
I don't want you to think I'm crazy.
"I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never showed up."
I have a lot of work to do today.
"Strangely, he passed up her very generous offer."
I like movies.
Astronomy is an expensive hobby.
I've got more important things to do.
Tom is studying at Harvard.
The teacher made me repeat the sentence.
We do this every year.
"You don't really care, do you?"
Tom never stays out late at night.
What I'm about to say will answer your question.
They consider him their best employee.
Tom wouldn't let Mary kiss him.
You don't have to do this for me.
Tom is busy now.
I don't have any cash on me right now.
Don't talk like that.
He did not want her to leave.
Don't talk to your mother that way.
You're a wonderful woman.
They sent him to prison in 1925.
I won't tolerate such language!
"If anyone should phone, say I will be back at one o'clock."
I read your book.
Tom felt both betrayed and humiliated.
Tom is not good enough.
Tom isn't the one who needs help.
Tom never did anything Mary had to forgive him for.
It's a worrying matter.
The drowning man shouted for help.
I couldn't do it without you.
Mary thought she could change Tom.
How long does it take to go to Okinawa by plane?
Is there a cat on the table?
I've got a few questions for you.
She is more pretty than beautiful.
Tom realized Mary was tired.
"What changes the world is communication, not information."
She assured him that everything was OK.
Someone tried to poison Tom.
How many fish did you catch?
This coat looks loose on me.
Tom ended up committing suicide.
Do you remember how it felt when the same thing happened to you?
Tom wasn't poor.
What's your favorite shampoo?
Tom looked at his footprints in the snow.
He went through a very hard time.
Be quiet while I'm speaking.
Where are all the others?
I thought you'd probably already gone home.
"To my surprise, he got married to a very beautiful actress."
I have waited a full three hours.
It took me some time to persuade her.
I pretended that I didn't see it.
Tom isn't going to shoot me.
I demand an explanation for this mistake.
The police arrested the man who had murdered the girl.
I know you're trying very hard.
Tom doesn't want to work here anymore.
Tom knows what it takes.
Tom seems smart.
Don't lean out the window.
Tom looked dirty.
It's doubtful if we'll finish in time for Christmas.
Tom isn't the only person who got arrested.
Neither of them looks happy.
"The girls were not afraid, but the boys were."
"Tom, we have a problem."
Why don't you go out?
You two would make a nice couple.
Have any of you read that book?
Life is unfair.
Do you study French at school?
She has a distinct English accent.
It has been two years since he came to Japan.
When did you get to Kyoto?
Tom and I ran.
What do you like to do in your spare time?
This gate needs painting.
Tom always lies.
I'd like to find out why Tom lied to me.
Give me two pieces of chalk.
Tom and Mary met while walking their dogs.
He put the blame upon me.
She always stands up for her convictions.
"Tom really knows how to cook, doesn't he?"
Do you want me to sing?
What is this fish called in English?
I think I will wear this red sweater.
I think you're wrong.
This old house is made of wood.
My grandfather's picture is on the wall.
I really have to get this done today.
I think that Tom is hiding something.
Yesterday was Sunday.
I'll buy you a drink.
I didn't have time for that.
Tom and Mary hurried up the steps together.
Tom needs time.
Tom went to school to learn how to tune pianos.
I wanted to punch him in the face.
I'll return to my country someday soon.
We all know how you feel about Tom.
We still want to help you.
Can you find your way home?
I haven't slept well recently.
My stomach is often a bit upset after eating spicy food.
The children ran up and down the stairs.
He wears thick glasses.
You're supposed to be working.
"Hang on, Tom, it won't be long now."
I want a drink.
Can you imagine the world without money?
I'll come back tomorrow.
She is going to be six next year.
It is the job that is never started that takes longest to finish.
That was sweet of you.
What's the difference between jam and marmalade?
Keep an eye on this suitcase.
She's lost her car keys.
Mary is still living at home with her parents.
I went to the station to see my friend off.
Have you guys been up all night?
Tom is extremely kind.
I didn't know he had decided to leave.
Tom abandoned his wife and children.
Look at these photos.
Tom doesn't care for ice cream.
I had to work.
We offer low-cost prefabricated houses.
We were traveling during the summer.
Tom saw Mary in the park.
What's the horse's name?
Make a circle and hold hands.
Tom told Mary to put the hammer back into the toolbox when she was finished using it.
Tom injured himself.
It matters.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Where is your money?
Tom drowned while swimming in the river.
"Fortunately, I made it to the class."
"In many ways, animals can do things better than people can."
She poured brandy into the glasses.
He drank orange juice out of a bottle.
I don't believe such things exist.
I think Tom is thirty.
Let me help you with your work.
Put out the light.
It was very windy.
What makes you think Tom is here?
Tom's dog was run over by a truck.
"After I got married, my French got better since I started speaking French with my wife."
That town looked prosperous.
We were both thirsty.
Tom is finally going to do what he told us he'd do.
Do you think Tom is going to agree to this?
Tom listened to the sound of the waves crashing on the beach.
I took a taxi because it was raining.
It's nearly six o'clock.
The pay is meager.
"Have you ever had genuine Hungarian goulash? ""No, but I'd really like to."""
I suppose you think Tom is really stupid.
We ordered too much food.
Tom is an excellent cricket player.
We are on the wrong track.
Can I open my eyes now?
Tom has it wrong.
I want the whole world to know about us.
The boy started to sob.
What's this?
Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today.
I knew you'd get it.
The sun is about to set.
I'll stay here until you return.
You don't have to do this.
The water is not fit to drink.
Mary's lemon cheesecake is to die for.
The facts speak for themselves.
It took me five hours to drive from here to Tokyo.
A gentleman would not say such a thing.
"Come on, it'll be fun."
The cake is in the kitchen.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
What a beautiful Sunday to read in the sun.
He went to America.
You should know it.
Is it true that you were absent yesterday?
We were starting to worry you wouldn't make it in time.
He is a famous detective and my friend.
The plane has just taken off.
Drinks are on me.
She worked from morning till night.
Who taught you how to dance?
The interview is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
We've seen it before.
It isn't going to be easy.
I left my shoes at school.
"You don't want to talk to me, do you?"
I'll follow Tom's recommendations.
I think Tom looked better before he shaved off his beard.
I don't want them.
Is that what it takes?
I thought Tom had answered all your questions.
I don't enjoy teaching children to swim when their parents are around.
She tried in vain not to cry.
You're imagining things.
Be careful that the thread doesn't break.
You can't learn a language without making mistakes.
Tom cut Mary's hair.
It wouldn't be too difficult.
Most people think so.
"I won't repeat this, so listen carefully."
I appreciate your suggestion.
Tom had better hurry if he wants to get home before dark.
It was less than fifteen dollars.
Are you expecting any visitors?
I forced her to do my homework.
I met him quite unexpectedly.
Tom died of liver cancer.
I just went home without saying anything.
I can't really discuss that.
Tom still hates Mary.
Tom said that he'd look at it.
Tom is putting the children to sleep.
Tom lowered his voice.
Take me there.
The dog stopped barking.
They cheered.
I agree with you that the actor is very talented.
The girl sitting at the piano is my daughter.
That's the building where my dad works.
I have to go to work.
The room emptied when the gong for dinner sounded.
Please give my regards to your parents.
I know exactly what I have to do.
I'm beginning to doubt whether Tom can really understand French all that well.
How old is your sister?
Tom doesn't care for Japanese food.
I doubt if Tom will come on time.
Don't you read the sports pages?
Would you lend me some money?
Tom was skeptical.
Is that your sister?
He's uninsured.
Nobody can predict the future.
"As a prank, some students let three goats loose inside their school after painting the numbers 1, 2 and 4 on the sides of the goats. The teachers spent most of the day looking for goat number 3."
She works for French intelligence.
Was it rainy in London?
I can't afford it.
You can't really expect Tom to change.
You should have refused his offer.
Something terrible is about to happen.
She has buried her only son.
Tom has gone to get Mary.
You've just got to try harder.
My head does hurt a little.
Tom put the calendar on the wall behind his desk.
The coup attempt was foiled at the last moment.
Tom thought it would be funny to put an egg on Mary's chair.
Some people at the meeting didn't like my proposal.
They're watching you.
Press this button to start the machine.
Tom left home at 2:30.
I just work here.
Christmas falls on Sunday this year.
The cat is looking at the fish.
Isn't Tom with you?
"I don't know if I've ever told you, but you have beautiful eyes."
You over-analyze everything.
Brush your teeth well.
I wanted to say thank you for all your help.
"If you hadn't done it, someone else would have."
Don't say anything.
The front of the house is painted white.
The surface of the earth is 70% water.
She doesn't need to go there herself.
This is a nice place for a picnic.
Correct me if I am wrong.
I'm disappointed.
"I thought it would be a good concert, but it wasn't."
I told Tom I'd help him reinstall Windows.
It belongs to Tom.
She is very pretty.
"This car is my father's, but it'll soon be mine."
Tom is from Harvard.
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Tom's proposal wasn't acceptable.
One of my friends wants to move in with me.
Tom absconded with millions of dollars from his company and is living a life of luxury on an island in the Mediterranean.
Tom's house is warm inside even on cold days.
Why does nobody answer?
"This year, Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday."
I thought you said you weren't interested.
Mary can't have any more children.
She'll try it once more.
They had no money left.
You should have accepted his advice.
He drank a bottle of wine.
She quit the company.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
I go straight home after work.
You should've seen the look on Tom's face when he saw Mary and John kissing.
My mother tasted the soup and added a little more salt.
He must be the principal.
I've got to agree with Tom here.
She was advised by him to give up drinking.
What you are saying does not make sense.
Are you sure you don't want to go to the doctor?
He broke his leg in the baseball game.
This gun is out of bullets.
Go away.
What would your mother think if she saw you like this?
I'll never tell anyone where I've hidden the treasure.
I'm surprised you weren't invited.
The girl trembled with fear.
Don't mention this to Tom.
Tom doesn't have to thank me.
I'm trying to figure out a solution.
Does this make any sense to you?
It's really horrible.
He's stronger than me.
Don't be angry with me.
I'm so proud of Tom.
The boys kept quiet.
Keep it on you.
He likes to talk of love.
They laughed at his mistake.
The movie we watched was in French with English subtitles.
He asked his teacher for advice.
She doesn't believe in God.
We're brothers.
It's now my turn.
Tom told me that he was sick.
We're back early.
The class start at ten.
Tell us who you are.
This shirt is too small for me to wear.
Tom and Mary are in Tom's car.
Tom gave me a black eye.
He will end up in prison.
Tom was faced with an enormous task when his mother died leaving a badly cluttered house for him to clean up.
It's what Tom had.
I just finished breakfast.
Let me know your exam results.
Tom was elected to the Senate in 2008.
The test was easy.
Tell Tom we're waiting for him.
Let's shake hands.
Japan has frequent earthquakes.
This could happen to anybody.
Tom seems to be biased.
I bought a new handbag.
Tom spent the afternoon with Mary.
I'm pretty sure that Tom just made up that story.
My brother earns half as much money as my father.
I hear that she is a famous actress.
What will you wear?
Did you bring them?
Thanks all the same.
They went to church on Christmas Eve.
"Come here, Tom."
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of your friends.
Tom went downtown to do shopping.
It happens.
That is a leather belt.
Tom told me that he was very tired.
My home is my castle.
I don't have a car.
"Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you."
Some people keep rare animals as pets.
I would buy him a beer.
It's the best book that I've ever read.
I'm not quite 150 centimeters tall.
You must go outside if you want to smoke.
The girl singing over there is my sister.
Tom asked Mary to clean his office.
The medicine didn't help at all.
Avoid bad company.
We're going to name him Tom.
Tom has already been told to do that by himself.
He was asking about your health.
Could you survive alone in the wilderness?
Am I allowed to use this?
I guess I was mistaken.
Tom is always complaining about his wife.
I'm not feeling very well.
"Strange to say, I didn't notice it."
They are unreliable.
We had to go back to the drawing board.
"Thank you. ""You're welcome."""
Your opinion is quite different from mine.
Tom isn't right.
I'll stand guard now. Go get some sleep.
Tom doesn't know for certain when Mary will arrive.
He looks strong.
Tom's dream has finally come true.
It's well worth the cost.
"I now live in Boston in the US, but I plan to go back to Japan before the end of the year."
"You agree with Tom, right?"
I'm not afraid of flying.
I think otherwise.
Tom is going to come on Monday.
Tom was detained.
We sang as we walked.
There's no need to hurry.
Tom was alone.
They can't see you.
I could have died tonight.
It was cool in the shade of the trees.
I cooked dinner for Tom.
The teacher told me to stand up.
Have you finished dinner?
She always lets her children do what they want to.
Tom isn't my name.
You don't really know me.
Please don't forget to put a stamp on the letter before mailing it.
Tom has a large jar of pennies.
He showed me a lot of beautiful photos.
Tom wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
Should I really do it?
Can we at least think about it for a minute?
I have a cat and a dog.
Does Tom have to be here?
Tom is likable.
I've got to go to church tomorrow.
I just have one question.
There are many mysteries in life.
I know Tom is rich.
This is the last time.
What do you like to cook the most?
This building is very large.
I don't have it with me.
We're getting closer.
Tom has a pretty wife.
He only speaks one language.
Sometimes I get carried away.
Tom and Mary are doing their homework.
Tom's pulse is low.
Are you laughing at me?
Please simmer the beans for a while over a low heat.
He was kind enough to show me the way to the library.
"The black cat purred, as if he was being petted."
I want to tell you about Tom.
You don't have to go unless you want to.
Tom coughed loudly.
I demand a refund.
Tom worries about making mistakes at work.
"If I had known, I would not have come."
Tom seemed to have been very busy.
There are still many cultural differences between East and West Germany.
It is difficult to understand his theory.
She married him last year.
She sent me a letter.
Boys are not welcome.
I think this book is easy.
This is only a temporary setback.
Have you seen enough?
Who's your most interesting friend?
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen.
Tom has his own problems.
There is nothing to be scared of.
Computers are constantly being improved.
He's been teaching for 20 years.
Please call me Tom.
Tom is reluctant to leave.
Come tomorrow.
They are good people.
All but one were present.
I'm slowly getting used to the humid climate here.
You are a bit fat.
The cat is waiting for you at home.
People do not trust a weak government.
Tom should've come with you.
The gasoline tank was underneath.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
She never wears pants.
I hope Tom says yes.
I'd be willing to do that.
There is nothing like cold beer on a hot day.
I thought they offered you a job.
I will never throw away my Playstation.
Tom didn't tell Mary the whole truth.
They continued to push south.
Do you have any management experience?
It is time you went to school.
Tom smiled when Mary entered the room.
Many university students don't have a lot of money.
He's a gambler.
My father will come home at seven.
This is the first time I've heard that word.
"Even when you're old and gray, you should be able to enjoy life."
Who's going to believe that?
Tom is very likely to be late.
That's how Tom makes his living.
He said that he was very happy.
Get off my car.
It took ten years to build the amusement park.
He has greasy hair.
No two snowflakes are exactly alike.
Where did you get that shirt?
His name is known to everyone in this town.
I'm getting tired of your complaints.
Did you cook this yourself?
I have a lot of work to do.
Who escaped?
I could help you with that.
Don't make me say it.
Why haven't I seen you here before?
Tom is back in Boston.
What do you want to do?
I'm not afraid of the future.
This is a question for Tom.
I see a bird on the roof.
"If you had taken my advice, you wouldn't be in such trouble."
Tom drove Mary to work yesterday.
Tom is a reckless driver.
Tom does know that.
Tom used to get bullied at school.
Is there another word for synonym?
Everything's gone.
How long do we have?
What's the asking price?
Why do you care about this?
She spent some time in Boston.
I'll tell you afterwards.
Tom works for a tech company in Silicon Valley.
This kind of music is something that older people have difficulty understanding.
I'll be able to see you next year.
How do you feel now?
Just deal with it.
I'll go crazy if this keeps up.
It fits perfectly.
Tom works for a small company.
He does not listen.
Please forgive me for forgetting to call you.

Please wait for me at the station.
The race was fixed.
I stayed home last night to be able to receive your call.
Mary is absolutely beautiful.
Never tell a lie.
I have a car that was made in Japan.
Tom thinks he's invincible.
You need to get some help.
You don't need to answer that letter.
Tom and Mary both cut themselves on some broken glass.
I don't know what you want and I don't care.

Tom stood quickly.
Tom is frightened.
I know a shorter route.

There's no harm in asking.
Tom said he didn't feel like talking to Mary.
Tom goes there whenever he has a chance.

I improvised.
I was showering a moment ago.
Come alone.
I'm sure this is only temporary.
How many years have you been married?
I told Tom Mary was OK.
I want you to meet Tom.
Tom loves music.
Tom wanted Mary.
She blew her lines.
They even listened to music.
Tom has returned from Boston.
Where do you think you are?
Tell the taxi driver to drive faster.
The patient is up and about.
"After a hectic few days at work, Tom is looking forward to a change of pace."
It will only hurt a little.
The room was filled with people.
That'll be hard to explain.
Most students are preparing for the final exams.
She gave him a sweater.
"I said nothing, which made her angry."
We should read one book a month at least.
Don't sit down on the sofa.
This house is too small to live in.
Who says that?
Is there anyone else?
You're not Canadian.
So you really don't know?
The Americans had nothing to do with the matter.
It's made of leather.
Tom made a loose translation from the original.
How long have Tom and Mary been married?
Hi.
You're driving way too fast.
This is difficult to do.
"Tom and Mary got divorced, just like you predicted."
I think Tom is still in Boston.
What part of Boston does Tom live in?
"A few years ago, on Mother's Day, I gave my stepmother a locket as a present."
They held him for a few hours and then let him go free.
Isn't that what you want?
What animal would you compare yourself to?
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend.
My father must do the work.
Tom is over there standing by the window.
He kept us waiting for more than an hour.
How late do you stay open?
I never gave up hope.
Can you try this number again?
Can you show me?
Tom looked at the old photographs.
She embroidered her initials on a white handkerchief.
There are some who would consider Tom handsome.
That's the solution to the puzzle.
Do you drink coffee every day?
We climbed up the steep mountain.
Elves have pointy ears.
The monkey fell from the tree.
You shouldn't break promises.
Tom was the first to arrive and the last to leave.
He has come a long way.
Stop pulling your sister's hair.
I have money enough to buy it.
That magazine is aimed at teenagers.
I was very glad to hear the news.
Would you be interested in coming with us?
Playing cards is fun.
Is Tom there alone?
Tom and Mary couldn't talk to each other then because they didn't speak a common language.
Add one teaspoon of paprika.
Tom lost all of his money.
He was forced to resign as prime minister.
It sounds downright frightening.
She knows a lot about the latest fashions.
The castle was transformed into a marvelous museum.
I believe you have information that can help us.
Don't let him switch on the lamp.
They are not a well-matched couple.
The thief ran away in the direction of the station.
Is it right for a doctor to decide when someone should die?
Do you speak the same language to your father that you speak to your mother?
How kind of you!
They say he's sick.
Tom got very thirsty.
We acted in good faith.
Why are you always so angry?
We are free from danger.
He was in the hospital for a week.
Is it large enough?
Tom sang a duet with Mary.
Everyone is very proud of you.
Please tell me which railway line to use from the airport to downtown.
I have nothing to do with the matter.
Remove your shirt and lie down.
We can't play poker if we don't have any cards.
She couldn't study abroad for lack of money.
Is this a duty-free shop?
He doesn't like coffee.
That was somebody else's idea.
"Hurry up, or you will be late."
I will stay until tomorrow.
It looks delicious.
Tom promised to keep what Mary told him under his hat.
We know you're there.
I haven't seen you for ages.
Do you like this color?
The submarines sank a lot of ships.
We're getting fewer and fewer students.
I don't need a history lesson.

Thomas Jefferson left the White House in March of 1809.
Tom is the captain of the football team.
Do you want me to help you or not?
I only wish it were that simple.
Thanks for bringing Tom home.
It's time for a change.
I love to hear a grandfather clock chime.
What did she do to you?
What do you think of these?
Is Tom studying French at school?
We're stuck in traffic.
We want Tom to stay for a couple of more days.
I have lived here since 1990.
See you back at the apartment.
Tom made me come here.
Why are you asking me that?
Tom and Mary stopped and picked up a hitchhiker.
Do you have a table near the window?
Where did you get this?
How long does it take for light from the sun to reach the earth?
I don't know where the bus stop is.
Don't be too sure.
Please don't touch the merchandise.
Tom and Mary want to see us.
I don't think it's any of your business.
It was when I was eight years old that I climbed Mt. Fuji with my father.
Tom is my son's friend.
"That's what Tom said, too."
My brother sends you his regards.
I am undressing.
Tom and Mary are the same age.
Tom interpreted for me.
He did well for a beginner.
Those two experiments yielded similar results.
Tom was stuck in a crowded elevator.
How do you know they're Canadians?
We miss you.
Why are you talking like that?
"It's his, isn't it?"
I'll get in touch with you soon.
She hates him.
You're modest.
He's accustomed to traveling.
He has three brothers.
Tom has an imaginary friend.
There are some important questions that science cannot answer.
We did not think about the price.
Why are you denying it?
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
I wish she would stop smoking.
We don't want to hurt you.
Tom was arrested by a plainclothes police officer.
How old do you have to be to drive a car?
I finally have time to reply to the mail that I have received these past three weeks.
Can you please stop that?
What kind of food should I be feeding my dog?
There is no milk left.
Don't listen to her.
Do you know Mr. Jackson?
Maybe I can help.
She loves children.
Write these words in your notebook.
Are you good at tennis?
It's great to see so many people enjoying themselves.
Tom wrapped himself in a warm blanket.
You should have bought a Teflon-coated pan.
Do you like coffee?
Don't tease Tom.
I thought everyone knew.
Teak is a tropical dark wood used for making furniture.
Why did you paint your fence red?
I should've tried to help Tom.
I watched it on YouTube.
I've only been there once.
Will he recover?
"The good old days have gone, never to return."
I thought I told you to get out of my way.
We need another three million dollars to complete this project.
Tom's office is larger than Mary's.
The difference between the right word and almost the right word is the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.
He's afraid of the sea.
Have you ever seen any of Tom's paintings?
I was sweating a little bit.
Watch this.
She teaches English.
I sat in the car.
Why do people go to the movies?
You aren't likely to find that word in a dictionary that's this small.
Every boy and girl is taught to read and write.
I didn't unlock that door.
Tom showed up fifteen minutes late.
Don't forget to take your pills.
You're not invited to lunch.
Thank you for the donation.
I'm going to do it for you.
"To do him justice, we must admit that his intentions were good."
How long did you stay in Germany?
We know this.
You'd better not stay up too late.
Tom stayed put.
He broke into a house.
I thought Tom was a Canadian.
There were candles everywhere.
I'm a little curious.
You may take my word for it.
Did you really plan to do this all yourself?
He got away disguised as a policeman.
Remember what we spoke about yesterday.
"When your husband finds out, he won't be happy."
I can't help it.
Please tell me what this is.
How is life?
One thing led to another.
You shouldn't give up hope.
He's always been kind to me.
"In case something happens to me, I'd like you to take care of my children."
You will be able to sing better next time.
She sang better than him.
The dog walked across the street.
Tom asked Mary if she knew his new address.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
The talk between labor and management yielded no definite results.
This answer may not necessarily be wrong.
Tom went back to the table.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Tom saw the pictures.
The number of students is dropping.
I'll wait for you in here.
Matters are getting worse and worse.
What did you want to talk with me about?
Do you have a son?
He tends to be arrogant.
I mentioned your name to him.
You have everything.
You'll have to come with me.
He'll be along in ten minutes.
Tom loves singing.
I've got to agree with Tom on this one.
Tom awoke to find himself in a strange room.
We don't have to watch this.
Tom knew better.
Did Tom call you?
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.
Tom likes sitting on the beach in the early morning.
I sat beside her.
Tom is an amateur.
Tom is going to sit here.
They broke down the old house.
He was brought up by her grandmother.
Tom died from lack of oxygen.
I am tall.
I can't finish the job in so short a time.
Did you plant this yourself?
It's a simple question.
Tom doesn't have the ability to do that.
I just want to win.
Tom bought a new tennis racket.
I had met her many times before then.
Will you do it for me?
We had a slight difference of opinion.
Tom could've done that without your help.
You have my full support.
I replied that I didn't have parents any more.
He was too young to go to school.
What does this remind you of?
Let's meet again soon.
Don't make so much noise.
"If it's a simple tune, I can sight-sing it."
What's wrong with being nude in your own house?
He's an ex-con.
Do you have any complaints?
Tom was clever.
You can wear your undershirt.
It looked like you were in a hurry.
I guess Tom is on vacation.
Tom sells flowers.
"Tom isn't going with you, is he?"
Mum's the word.
That girl wanted to become a movie star.
Tom refuses to eat his vegetables.
We're not exactly sure what it was.
You can probably guess what happens though.
He went by bicycle.
I really like this skirt. Can I try it on?
Tom led the group of men into his office.
You should've stayed in Boston longer.
Tom put his wallet on the table.
One of us could help Tom.
Tom already knows the truth.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I want to be here for you.
How many books do you possess?
I don't like soccer.
May I borrow your bicycle?
Tom is washing his car.
The girl under the tree looks sad.
That hotel has a homey atmosphere.
You have no idea how distressed she was.
I have nothing to complain about.
Tom loves kids.
I didn't sign anything.
Tom yelled loud enough for everyone to hear.
This book is designed to teach children how to read.
Can you spare some change?
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.
Parenting is difficult and stressful.
Who gave you this?
Here's how we do it.
"Tom looked at Mary, not sure what to say."
I hear voices.
What kind of juice do you want?
I'm the only one who ever really liked Tom.
You'd probably really like it.
"Mary was a very intelligent, but very quiet girl."
Give me a hug.
I need to be alone so I can think.
What's wrong with your dog?
You really did a good job.
Has the world gone mad?
I fell in love.
Do you want your whiskey straight or should I mix it with water?
I'll take that into consideration.
You probably just have a cold.
It didn't surprise me at all that Tom didn't do what he'd told Mary he was going to do.
It wasn't your fault.
You can't leave now.
I didn't know you played the oboe.
"In high altitudes, people find it hard to breathe."
Do you have any quarters?
Take care of the kids for me.
I wish everybody would stop telling me I need to be more careful.
Excuse me.
I know Tom helped you.
Tom and Mary had a heated discussion on same-sex marriage.
She met him only recently.
Tom and I both work.
I can't believe Tom still talks with you.
Tom is credible.
I suppose you think Tom is really stupid.
Sit over there and shut up.

Tom bought Mary a box of chocolates.
The guard unlocked the cell door.
Tom tricked Mary into doing his work for him.
Gold had been discovered in California.
We'll call you.
I hope Tom was listening.
Please open the window.
When did you find out about it?
Hurry up! The concert is starting.
All you have to do to pass the entrance examination is to read this book.
This is the happiest I've ever been.
Tom is pig-headed.
The shoe doesn't fit me. It's too small.
Try on this new suit to see if it fits well.
This is ludicrous.
We were able to settle the matter finally.
I'm satisfied with the results.
This camera is less expensive than that one.
Tom is almost thirty.
There was a plate of uneaten food on the table.
Tom won't be here until 2:30.
I really do want to help Tom.
She advised him to visit that museum.
There is some truth to this.
The two of them got back together.
Tom is off doing his own thing.
We want to be here forever.
Both of your daughters are very beautiful.
His ideas sound crazy.
Tom isn't joking.
Please lend me your car.
This computer runs on batteries.
"According to the thermometer, it's about thirty degrees, but it's really humid so it feels much hotter than that."
We don't want any trouble.

I go to church on Sundays.
Watch your fingers!
Please don't do anything stupid.

He got lost on his way here.
You cannot read this novel without crying.
We love what we do.
Tom said he's always been interested in music.
How much is the entrance fee?
I heard Tom is sick.
I'll tell someone.
"Those are mine, I think."
A solution had to be found.
This river flows into the Pacific Ocean.
Tom and Mary are still there.
I've been looking for you.
"Tom has been putting on some weight ""Yeah, I noticed that."""
I've got my friend on the line right now.
I have things to do.
I am badly in need of your help.
I am counting on you to join us.
You're cheating.
Was the door closed?
Is it bad?
Something terrible's happened.
Tom is no hero.
You have a good reputation.
He must have lost his marbles.
My father is taking a walk in the park.
I'm so glad I'm not living in the Middle Ages.
How did you manage to escape?
I'm happy with what I have.
Tom shouted.
Tom told me I had done a pretty good job.
You ought to find nice shoes here.
I can't stand the sight of blood.
He is a good athlete.
I asked him if he would scratch my back.
I figured that you wouldn't want to go there without me.
Your friends will miss you.
They arrived in Osaka at the beginning of May.
I don't know whether it's right or not.
We're not doing that.
Tom was waiting to see what would happen.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
I didn't get your name.
Tom called Mary.
I need to find something to open this bottle with.
Can you taste the garlic?
This answer makes me angry.

I've never liked Tom.
I want you to be nice to Tom.

I knew you'd want to be told.
What do you want in return?
Tom drew a picture of a squirrel.
Tom became bald very young.
I'm talking about you.
Your problem is you don't study enough.
It's hard to believe that Tom wasn't aware that Mary was in love with him.
I prefer French films to American ones.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
I've passed every test so far.
I don't remember that guy's name.
Do you have any French newspapers?
Tom was all wrong.
Tom went to buy another pair of shoes.

I don't want to live in Boston.
Open your mouth!
Maybe they don't trust us.

He could not come because of his illness.
We can talk this through.

Tom now lives in Boston.
We just need more time.
Nothing bad happened.
I understand why.
I have to win.
"Tom's not coming, because I don't want him to."
What color are the walls in your room?
Tom is riding his bicycle.
You cannot smoke in this room.
What did you make?
I couldn't keep from smiling.
Today's a bit too hot for my liking.
You should pay your debts.
She is not my sister but my mother.
Please follow me. I'll show you how to get there.
This coat is rainproof.
What's your new book about?
No one will survive.
Is that from a book?

Stay thin.
Have you ever seen an elephant fly?
I was nervous the whole time.
How did you make it?

The maid will clean the guest room.
The cold weather lasted for three weeks.
I found him working in the garden.
I was scared at the mere thought of it.
It is rude to speak with your mouth full.
Tom is not far off the mark.
The wind is blowing.
Always look on the bright side of life.
Tom shouldn't wait for Mary for more than ten minutes.
Tom doesn't know Mary's telephone number.

He is quite an odd man.
This is my grandmother.
It was necessary to study the matter thoroughly.
Tom is very good at videogames.
"Who is in the car? ""Tom is."""
She whispered something to him.
He gets mad very easily.
I told Tom I couldn't do it.
You look content.
Show me what's in your pockets.
Take it easy.
Be attentive.
Thank you for inviting me.
I'm angry.
The constitution of the country is very democratic.
We must not make too much of this incident.
She got a present from her boyfriend.
You should help your mother clean the living room.
The train is twenty minutes behind time.
Do you think I'm crazy?
Tom looked up when he heard approaching footsteps.
This is a doghouse that I made myself.
Can you describe them to me?
Has Tom gone?
I'm upset.
I'm taking you with me.
Nothing happened between us.
Don't say anything to anybody.
It's not important anymore.
The train lurched to a standstill.
You don't need to keep anything.
"Tom's a bully, just like John is."
Tom left earlier.
Just how long do you think it'll take to get there?
Tom and Mary never do anything together anymore.
Tom had no intention of giving up.
Tom needs Mary.
I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
English is often considered an international language.
Don't you think the air conditioner is turned up too high in here?
"By the time you land at Narita, it will be dark."
Don't do it again.
Bring it here.
"Are you home, too?"
Tom was on the verge of starvation.
I'm new at this.
I copied a passage from the book into my notebook.
Is English spoken in Canada?
Stay cool.
Tom doesn't know Mary's address.
He will be in time for the train.
Can I talk to you a moment?
The strange-looking woman was thought to be a witch.
I know what you're probably thinking.
I can't complain about the way I've been treated.
I'm happy that Tom is here.
Tom wants to do that.
That hotel serves very good food.
He dumped me.
She talks a lot.
Tom dug a hole.
I did that on purpose.
"At one time, there was a bridge here."
I persuaded him to take part in it.
Why is Tom shy?
Tom is a tax consultant.
He was unable to completely give up on his hopes of marrying her.
Tom is the fastest runner in his class.
The kids were gone when I got home.
You're wearing the clothes you wore yesterday.
Can I take your order now?
What did you eat for breakfast?
I've known Tom a lot longer than you have.
We're humming.
Is Tom big?
"He ran and ran, but could not catch up with his dog."
I don't even know your real name.
I'm really proud of you.
I'm on the football team.
Don't go yet.
Write the alphabet in capitals.
Tom doesn't own a car.
I'm no quitter.
Where did you meet my father?
"Miracles do exist, but we just don't notice them in the flow of events."
Tom sat down next to Mary on the bench.
A cold beer would hit the spot!
Endorse this check.
What do you feed your dog?
That is just her way.
The train connections at this station are excellent.
In order to qualify for the homestay you must have an interview with the sponsors.
Tom was already drinking his third beer before Mary had even finished her first.
He never breaks promises.
He slept in the car.
They say he is the best tennis player.
I've already forgotten Tom's girlfriend's name.
Tom always drives too fast.
I wanted to be a journalist.
Drink it down.
Thunderstorms are scary.
Tom was essentially right.
Tom thinks that nothing bad can happen to him.
He lives on his country estate.
Why are you siding with Tom?
This soil is moist.
When will you harvest your wheat?
Tom yelled at me for no reason.
The little boy grew very fast.
You had better hurry. The train leaves at three.
This is where I was born and raised.
The neighbor didn't see anything.
The school is a half-mile walk from my house.
Will you have to tell Tom?
What's your favorite wine?
I’m learning Chinese in Beijing.
He lives in luxury.
Please don't say that.
I was in Australia in 2013.
"See you around, Tom."
Dogs are barking.
I would do that right now if I were you.
"It's the truth, I swear."
Tom was nice to all Mary's friends.
She writes to him every week.
Give me back my book. I need it again.
I paid thirty dollars for these shoes.
She is always neat and tidy.
The bridge collapsed.
Tom was shaken by the experience.
Gold was discovered there.
Write your name in pencil.
Give me a second chance.
Have you fed the dog?
It exploded with a loud noise.
Tom wanted to buy that book and give it to Mary.
What time do you think you'll likely arrive?
Stores are closed in the afternoon because of the heat.
You're looking good!
I've shut all six windows.
Did you make that mistake on purpose?
He began to get restless because of that noise.
Don't you dare go there.
The cat is brown.
Do you wear glasses?
Could you please tell me what's wrong?
I'm glad you approve.
Why don't you folks make yourselves comfortable?
The judge concluded that the prisoner was innocent.
Tom was a witness to the accident.
"You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in."
I'm in a good mood.
I liked your speech.
I want to know your opinion.
Tom thought Mary's offer was unreasonable.
Tom beat Mary to death.
"Compared with his brother, he is not so intelligent."
I know how difficult it is for you to admit that you are wrong.
Where does your grandpa live?
This room fits just under fifty people.
I don't know how to play bridge.
I didn't want that to happen.
We ought to help each other.
Call Tom.
Tom and Mary think I don't know.
We gave our word.
I can't remember when I first met Tom.
The situation is worse than I thought.
Turn left and you will find the cafe.
"Tom is very handsome, isn't he?"
I wish Tom were more like you.
We can't force people to do that.
She spends her holidays at her uncle's.
Please give me your credit card.
Tom called to tell Mary that he'd be late.
The man blushed.
I like being with you.
He's very ill.
I am digging a well.
"Hey, you! What are you doing?"
Tom crossed his arms across his chest.
I'm wide awake.
Tom has a terrible reputation.
You can't scare me.
Tom ran as fast as his legs would take him.
You must eat properly to keep up your strength.
It was an awful week.
How much is that all together?
It would be sad if that were true.
"If Tom goes, I will, too."
Nobody's going to die.
There is a bottle of wine on the table.
I'd like to stay here.
One of them is lying.
Bring me my shoes.
We were glad to hear that he got back safely.
Tom is looking for a good place to pitch the tent.
You're modest.
How long can you stay?
They never give up.
The photograph brought back memories of my childhood.
She belongs to the Democratic Party.
He dropped the sausage on the ground.
The cat loves playing in the garden.
Do you want to come over for dinner tonight?
I've been all over the world.
Please tell me you're making this up.
His son is eight years old.
When was the last time you saw your boyfriend?
"At first, I thought he was sick."
The two of them fought for the prize.
"You do your thing, I'll do mine."
The noise continued for several hours.
I thought you said your name was Tom.
He hesitated before answering.
"If you buy me an ice cream, I'll give you a kiss."
She was humiliated by him.
How did you sleep last night?
It was snowing.
Do you think anyone can see us?
Help me take this apart.
This is my father.
I would like some fish.
This is a duplicate copy.

What are you crying for?

You're wealthy.
Do you want to see it again?

Tom thought Mary was wasting her time.
Tom stepped away from the door.
"Even though it hadn't rained for several days, the ground was still quite wet underfoot."
Did you enjoy the salad?

Their names escaped me.

It doesn't fit.
We'll pray for you.
The book is mine.
She stopped to smoke.
It's none of your business.

These days I'm very busy.
You're a true friend.
That's exactly what I thought.

You should be put away.
We've allowed for that.
Would you like a room with a bath or a shower?
What's your hobby?
You told me you knew how to do it.

You're the last hope for humanity.

This question counts for 50 points.
You must apologize to Tom.
This bed is too hard to sleep on.
I don't recognize any of the people in the picture.
I must know the truth about Tom.
"Tom was furious, but he tempered his language because there were children present."
I have a few friends here.
I'm trying to figure out a solution.
What a lovely day!

She has very few close friends.
You can't do that anymore.
I met her on the street by accident.
Have you ever gone to the beach with Tom?
Tom isn't paying us anything.
They were shoveling the snow away.
Tom is going to explain it to all of us.
The box was full of books.
Does Tom know you work here?
Tom seldom wins arguments.
He couldn't bring himself to believe her story.
Let's change the subject.
"Sooner or later, his luck will run out."
I left halfway through the movie.
Please hurry! Tom is waiting.
I don't blame you for the accident. It wasn't your fault.
Tell me where you got this.
This problem is worth discussing.
He tried to adapt himself to his new surroundings.

I thought he would come.
I lost the watch.
It was cloudy all day long today.
It was like watching a slow motion movie.

He did both at the same time.
We'll deal with that later.

Who knows what he'll accomplish if given the chance?
She is very cross with him.
I sold it for ten dollars.
Don't say anything!
I often went skiing in the winter.
Tom says you're lying about what time you arrived.
She was never disrespectful to me.

Is there some reason you don't want us to come?
Do you want me to help you with your homework?
Do you know what she said?
Tom wants to come and see you.
I don't want to sign that.
It's annoying.
Black smoke was pouring out the windows.
Go and talk to Tom.

When was the last time you washed the car?
I know Tom isn't very happy here.
Where did you get on this bus?
Please don't leave me.
Here's what I want to do.
Can I take it home?
The news filled her with sorrow.
I had a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
The President is to speak on television this evening.
Let's take the bus.
You seem to be having fun.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
Where can we meet?
Tom drank a glass of wine.
I've known Tom since we were both kids.
That's reversing the logical order of things.
That belongs to my brother.
He is in great trouble.
Would you like to exchange links?
"Tom said, ""You can kiss your girlfriend goodbye if you don't kiss her goodbye,"" which meant, ""If you don't kiss your girlfriend goodbye, then you'll never see her again."""
Everything had happened so quickly.
That depends on whether you are interested or not.
I promise that I won't tell anybody why we're here.
They were very confused.
Tom and Mary are young and healthy.
I am in the classroom.
Kids are cruel.
My father is getting bald.
Can you sell the book to me for 500 yen?
Do you like writing?
They pushed back the attackers.
I dropped out of college.
That's very naughty of you.
I just bought it last week.
"When I woke up this morning, the rain had turned into snow."
I wake him at six every morning.
Tom appears astonished.
Her new hairstyle covers her ears.
Tom shouldn't have been here today.
Tom said that he was hungry.
Don't say stupid things like that anymore.
"If you studied hard, you would get good marks."
He mentioned her name for the first time.
Have you ever heard someone speaking French?
I can run.
We must keep calm.
I like your garden and the flowers in it.
I didn't realize it until much later.
Are we lost?
Tom thinks Mary is interested in John.
"Two tickets, please."
Tom writes everything down so he won't forget it.
Did you bring it?
I'm all alone here.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
You may read this book.
He got hoarse from so much shouting.
"Judging from what you say, he may succeed."
We're short on time.
The train for Birmingham leaves from platform 3.
They stopped quarreling when I came in.
Tom is feeling a little better today.
Do you know what I like?
I think it will be sunny.
That's something to think about.
Do you have everything?
You won't remember a thing.
It is of little value.
Mary isn't really sick. She's faking it.
He's very influential in the world of medicine.
I can get it from Tom.
Tom didn't mention it to me.
I've been in Sapporo before.
The only difference between a bad cook and a poisoner is the intent.
This is the best method to solve that problem.
I'll be back at ten.
Who is ultimately responsible for this?
Did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters?
How well did you know Tom?
The clouds are getting darker.
She makes a point of taking a shower before breakfast.
I would never forgive myself if anything happened to you.
Tom left without saying goodbye.
She's in the restroom.
Tom planted a small peach tree in front of his house.
Stop dreaming.
Who should I vote for?
What advice did Tom give you?
His behavior is my primary concern.
I arrived on the night he left.
Why didn't you just tell the truth?
We changed everything.
Would it OK if I go over to Tom's house to play?
"For that reason, he lost his job."
I was tempted.
"What color is your underwear? ""I'm not wearing any."""
You must've been dreaming.
Lincoln was opposed to slavery.
That was then and this is now.
"Where's your cousin? ""She's just left."""
They don't know that.
Would you like another sandwich?
Tom doesn't mind lending Mary money.
This is my house.
We have no reason to do that.
Tom picked up his clarinet and started to play.
The room was full of people.
The monkey got away.
We had a rough time.
Tom has taught French for thirty years.
Tom didn't know that woman at all.
I like your new hair color.
Ask me again in October.
It's not easy to translate a poem in a foreign language.
I have just finished reading the book.
He took the wrong bus by mistake.
Are you saying you don't know?
The animal made a squeaking sound.
Where did you go on your summer vacation?
Tom admitted that he had been wrong.
Don't go. Stay here with me.
I lived in Rome.
Perhaps that would be possible.
I'll find out for you.
I'm unemployed.
She is a blonde girl.
You were very brave.
You're kind of cute when you're mad.
I do not trust him any longer.
They were afraid.
We don't have to read that.
"Tom may be old, but he's in good shape."
I spend at least three hours a week studying French.
I picked you some flowers.
I'm afraid he will never admit his guilt.
"Two tickets to San Diego, please."
"Excuse me, but I didn't order this."
Why is Tom here?
Is it cold outside?
"Buy it for me, please."
Why don't we go inside the store to warm up?
I'm sure that she's correct.
Don't run.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
Tom practices black magic.
What is on the desk?
Kids grow up so fast.
Where are you taking me?
Tom's hands are greasy.
He'll be here again.
You were our last hope.
Please don't be mad.
Has Tom come back already?
It seemed that there was no one in the village.
Don't interrupt.
I had to work on an essay.
Can he speak Japanese?
I usually shower at night.
I thought you wanted to wait.
We have to find out who did this.
All the men in Tom's family are bald.
You can't bring that stuff into a hospital room.
They don't listen.
This shoe fits me well.
Tom was afraid that someone would find out about his past.
Tom was inside.
What should we do if it rains?
I have to burn the midnight oil tonight.
He heard a noise from the kitchen.
Tom is treating a patient.
The rich are getting richer.
Tom woke up in the middle of the night and ate an entire bag of cookies.
Tom probably doesn't know who did that.
Is the bank open?
I think Tom looks really good.
Tom almost died in that accident.
We have a lot of things in common.
My hobby is collecting old coins.
Tom was speaking to some neighbors.
Would you like to go to the theater this evening?
The explanation was beyond my understanding.
This has nothing to do with what happened here last week.
I'm trying to cheer you up.
I want to look different.
Would you mind leaving us alone for a minute?
They went to the station by car.
"Wait, don't shoot!"
Do you have any more questions?
How do you know about that?
Could you exchange it with a different one?
I know you're thinking about me.
His sharp eyes never missed a mistake.
To live without air is impossible.
I don't know anything about the future.
Should I wait for her to come back?
"If you ever need a job, go see Tom."
Can you help me lift this?
Do you really believe that Tom is reliable?
People can easily tell the difference between them.
I'd like to make it clear that I will not change my mind.
I don't know which is which.
"You remember them, don't you?"
The food didn't look very appetizing.
Tom is interested in many things.
Tom knows about this already.
I need to lose a few pounds.
Tom threatened Mary.
You should call your father as soon as possible.
"In this respect, you're right."
My mother asked me not to feed the dog until after we had all eaten.
"When he broke his leg, he had to use crutches for 3 months."
The boy bowed to me.
I called Tom and told him about my problem.
It looks like you've already been replaced.
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
Many Germans have blonde hair and blue eyes.
I'm sorry I forgot to wake you up.
I'm not a fanatic.
He calculated that it would cost him 100 dollars.
One after another the animals died.
Tom has to look after Mary.
That cannot be true.
Can you do handstands?
Cancel all my appointments.
I can't force Tom to go.
Tom was praying.
Tom didn't wait for Mary.
Why didn't you tell me?
You completely ignored me.
She likes taking pictures.
When was the last time you cut your nails?
I understand how good Tom is.
Here's what I'm doing.
He was easily influenced.
Tom suffers from chronic pain.
Did you turn the stove off?
Why don't you help us?
Would you like to go out with me tonight?
The situation is getting better.
Which are Tom's?
Maybe they know something.
Take this medicine between meals.
I didn't catch even one fish.
My lips are sealed.
Do you go there often?
You can't let Tom eat anything that has peanuts in it.
We don't really have a plan.
Tom couldn't find his hometown on the map.
Turn down the radio.
He's worried that he might be late.
They want me.
Japan has a mild climate.
Is he right?
You have to take this.
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
The dog was busy burying his bone in the garden.
Don't be late for school.
Tom didn't listen.
Tom signaled Mary to stop.
I can't do it either.
Yours is over there.
I'll visit you tomorrow.
The story of his brave struggle affected us deeply.
They're going to be OK.
Could you please move out of my way?
I had to run to catch up with Tom.
Tom didn't have enough money to buy what Mary wanted him to buy for her.
Tom's impeccable manners made a big impression on Mary's parents.
I'm not ready.
Tom was willing to give up everything for Mary.
We are fighting an enemy we don't know.
Here is a present for your birthday.
I wasn't quite sure what to say.
"I like steak better than anything else, and eat it every other day."
You should have one of us do it.
Tom bought a table.
The situation has changed dramatically.
Tom was the last person I expected to meet in Boston.
Will you pay cash?
Please tell me it's a joke.
Does everyone think it was me who stole the money?
Now I feel guilty.
Are you still happy with your new car?
Tom sold everything he owned.
Can you play the piano?
You're not allowed to park there.
Tom ran back into the house.
"Tom is chubby, but Mary isn't."
Why didn't you bring an umbrella?
Tom gave Mary a call.
"Why don't you go to your room, Tom?"
Can't we talk about this later?
"In the course of our conversation, he referred to his youth."
"Are you going to go to Tom's concert? ""I most certainly am."""
Let Tom know we've got a problem.
I saw many familiar faces.
Have you made your decision yet?
"He thought about growing a beard, but gave up the idea of growing one."
I have a twin brother.
Do you smell that?
I always thought Tom and Mary made a good couple.
Tom heard Mary and John talking about doing that.
"It's a strange story, but every word of it is true."
"I'd like your attention, please."
Tom always wears a hat.
You're so lazy.
The decision is not final.
Tom and Mary seem to be enjoying each other's company.
I never listened to Tom.
Let's wait and see what happens.
How kind of you!
This is not a good idea.
Would you please leave us alone for a minute?
It is necessary.
They believed Tom.
I'd like to become a doctor.
Pink is for girls.
I'm free all afternoon on February 27th.
Colds are prevalent this winter.
Who is absent?
We'll talk about this later.
I'm not privy to their decisions.
You should dress more modestly.
Tom has already eaten lunch.
Tom groaned.
"Fortunately, I've got you to talk to."
I'll call you a cab.
I missed the last train.
Didn't that seem odd?
I want to be what you want me to be.
She was hit by a car while she was crossing the street.
Tom spread some strawberry jam on a slice of bread.
I have just been to the Midori Bank.
Don't beat around the bush.
You need to tell me the truth.
Do you have school today?
Tom is reading a history book.
Tom says he needs my help tomorrow.
Tom seemed surprised by this.
She was so tired that she couldn't walk.
Give me an example. I don't understand.
The author illustrated his book with a lot of pictures.
This camera is not loaded with film.
Why didn't Tom tell Mary the truth?
Tom jumped out of the helicopter.
Please replace the empty ink cartridge in the printer.
Now would be a good time.
Tom is photogenic.
I can't talk to you here. It's too dangerous.
I'm going again tomorrow.
I can't tell you how to pronounce the word.
Prices rose higher and higher.
I do not believe in the existence of God.
"Tom is Mary's brother, not her father."
We've been through this before.
He is a student at Harvard.
Tom wanted to start a new life.
That isn't what I said.
The only difference between a bad cook and a poisoner is the intent.
Let us go home.
Are there earthquakes in Germany?
Literature teaches us about humanity.
Count to one hundred.
Tom shared the apartment with Mary and three other friends.
I want more of that.
You can see the whole city from this hill.
Does Tom know what you do?
My name is Tom. What's yours?
Tom was probably right.
She came last.
"You don't think you can win, do you?"
Tom practiced his parallel parking.
Even men sometimes cry.
"In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea."
I have lost the key.
It's about five miles.
Tom is much better at doing that than Mary.
Which house is his?
Tom is a jock.
Karin is a German name.
Fishing is fun.
"I was born in Osaka, but brought up in Tokyo."
Do you have anything to add?
She was stupid enough to believe him.
Tom doesn't listen to me.
Getting your message across is much more important than trying to say it exactly like a native speaker would say it.
I am not sure.
Where's your favorite place to go when you want to be alone?
I want to test my limits.
I know who she is.
"We're one big, happy family."
It was my plan.
"If we were to live on the moon, how large would the earth look?"
Write down each word.
Mary is hoping that Tom will eat lunch with her.
Tom thinks I'm a wimp.
My uncle is very fond of fishing.
What kind of music will you guys be playing?
This dog is big.
The baby was sound asleep in her mother's arms.
The thermostat is defective.
Why are you looking at me?
Tom seldom bothers to comb his hair.
Call Tom's bluff.
She will report directly to me.
He's the class clown.
We want Tom to get better.
I'm sure that our team will win.
Tom is quite reliable.
Forty-eight sailors are on board.
This building has five elevators.
Who gave you this watch?
Is Tom from Boston?
I'm taking the train to Boston.
She furnished the room with beautiful furniture.
They stole horses and cattle.
The only thing that matters is whether or not you can do the job.
You were supposed to have this finished by yesterday.
Don't talk rubbish.
What does Tom have to do with this?
Where are you sitting now?
I haven't unpacked yet.
Misfortunes rarely come singly.
It is not so difficult as you think.
Promise me you won't go.
Tom knows how you feel.
He succeeded in swimming across the river.
When was it that Mary bought this skirt?
They are very old.
This does not apply to students.
They didn't even know what they were looking at.
We have made friends with Tom.
You'll never change.
Which famous person would you like to be friends with?
There's something wrong with this machine.
What is he like?
I'm very happy to see you.
Why don't you say something?
Why do you want to stop here?
I wish I was dead.
Could you send me a brochure?
Scientists have found water on Mars.
There are many ways to react to compliments.
Tom made a speech.
I visited Tom.
Tom is sound asleep on the sofa.
You'd better stay here.
Which floor do you live on?
I cry every time I listen to this song.
I've got one brother and two sisters.
I asked Tom to open the door.
Let's keep it.
"To be honest, I'm not exactly sure what happened."
I feel nothing but contempt for such dishonest behavior.
Look at the girls.
I'm glad I could help you.
"In 1847, they declared themselves independent."
I was young and immature at the time.
"I thought I knew him, but I didn't."
Tom will likely be right.
A foreign language cannot be learned in only two weeks.
I like vanilla ice cream very much.
My whole body itches.
The police will put you behind bars for twenty years.
Tom bowed.
I have no further questions.
I got hit by a car.

This fruit doesn't taste good.
My memory is failing.
Tom is a good chess player.
"Have a drink, Tom."
He laid down the gun.
I nearly choked on a fishbone.
I wouldn't have waited.
We had better start before it begins to rain.
Do you know where he went?
Tom is as fast as a leopard.
I thought you said you couldn't afford a truck.
It's truly frightening.
I will promise you nothing.
Both he and I are members of that club.
Your hair is too long.
I'm not feeling well lately.
I've got to learn some new songs.
Tom was robbed.
I wonder what happens if I press this button.
He is reading a book in his room.
"Hey, listen to me."
The accident is still vivid in his memory.
"There were many signs in the park that said ""Keep off the grass."""
What do you think of this sweater?
Tom can't hurt you.
Do you know something I don't know?
I pricked my thumb with a needle.
Tom told Mary it wouldn't be easy.
My mother has gone to the beauty shop.
Hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water.
It was hard for him to stop working.
A fire broke out nearby.
This is the only tie I have.
He is an authority on China.
It gets very humid here in the summer.
A girl opened the door in answer to my knock.
I already told Tom everything.
Tom falsified the reports.
Nobody taught me.
I neither heard nor saw anything.
They were professional killers.
Promise me you won't tell Tom.
Do you know kabuki?
I hope to see you tomorrow.
You have no right to pass judgement on these people.
Life is full of surprises.
Have you seen the news?
Who stabbed Tom?
People might think you're stupid if you do that.
Tom was not born blind.
I bought a red sweater at that shop.
This door is locked.
A man suddenly appeared in the doorway.
Just put it there.
"You're a good role model, Tom."
The boy has a watch in his hand.
"Long story short, I was fired."
I saw you driving by my house this morning.
Eleven o'clock is good for me.
"I can't keep up with Tom, but it's fun trying."
This is one of mine.
It will take her at least two years to be qualified for that post.
Tom couldn't answer all of the questions.
Why did he have to wait for you for so long?
The mood in the courtroom was tense.
You can't do this.
I'm not as creative as Tom is.
Why did you put off the printing of my book?
I'll be in my office if you need me.
I could not possibly finish the work in a few days.
Tom hid his money under his mattress.
You should clean your glasses.
Who's ready for more?
When did you get home?
Look at the picture on the wall.
There is nothing the matter with the motor.
I want you to return to Boston.
I should've listened more carefully.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
The glass is full of water.
"What do you think of it, Tom?"
I haven't finished my homework yet.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Tom knows some of Mary's friends.
You're useless.
We live in the country during the summer.
That was never an issue.
I am able to read English.
Tom became violent.
You've brightened my day.
I'd like to know what you intend to do now.
Tom pulled out a pen.
This clock loses three minutes a day.
Are you interested in art?
I know that Mary is more beautiful than I am.
You've gained weight.
How do I know you're not an imposter?
Valentine's Day is celebrated in February.
What's the bus fare?
Water power turns the wheel.
It would be better to leave it unsaid.
Tom walked to the front door and knocked.
Hang your hat on the hook.
I wanted to be the first to congratulate you.
What do you think the best way to do it is?
"After supper, I washed the dishes."
I have turned 20.
Tom and Mary spend a lot of time together.
I wonder what it tastes like.
Tom has a tendency to exaggerate.
I lost a bet.
I'm not outgoing.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Could you please tell me how tall you are and how much you weigh?
Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
You sound very sure of yourself.
Could you please lower your voice?
Tom works for a bank.
I went to sleep during the lesson.
This is never going to end.
It looks like someone's jealous.
Do you have any idea who could be behind this?
I forgot to bring warm clothes.
Don't play here.
The meat has gone bad.
Tom must've had his reasons.
I congratulate you on passing the examination.
International disputes must be settled peacefully.
Will he be here soon?
We're not all as busy as you are.
Tom was incorrect.
"Tom and Mary filled balloons with water, and dropped them from the balcony down onto unsuspecting pedestrians walking on the pavement below."
"Tom is allergic to bees, hornets and wasps."
What do you mean by it?
Tom is innovative.
Correct me if I am wrong.
Speaking French is a lot of fun.
Tom is very talented.
"As far as I am concerned, I have no objection to the plan."
I'm in Perth.
It's been a long time since I've seen any dragonflies in this area.
I can't order Tom to do it.
When should I come to pick you up tomorrow?
I punched him in the face.
You can take today off.
Do you believe it now?
He told her that he loved her.
She is fond of playing tennis.
Is Tom over there with you?

This is an ancient law.
Do you believe Judas betrayed Jesus Christ?
Tom told me he felt bad about that.
My father is in his room.
I'll come alone.
They said they would not fight.
You should probably not tell Tom that you don't know how to do that.
She's two years older than him.
Saint Peter's Square was crowded.
The circus has come to town.
She knows how to do the crawl.
He thought I was my brother.
I've been a teacher for two years.
"Whatever you do, don't let go of the rope."
Tom and I sat on the bench.
Stand by for my orders.
Tom ate nothing.
Tom used to help Mary with her homework.
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
"There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers."
That's how Tom did it.
I can't believe it either.
He doesn't listen to me.
There's no one here who can translate these documents.
I am proud to be a part of this project.
Tom fed the pigs.
Come sit by me.
Do you see the portrait?
Will you come tomorrow?
Tom had an accident at work.
She helped cook lunch.
How do you plan to do it?
She fell in love with him.
"I guess this is how things are going to be from now on, so we'd better get used to it."
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time.
They played table tennis together.
Rome has a lot of ancient buildings.
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
Let's enjoy the long vacation.
Tom is still very upset.
Tom climbed in through the window.
Whose is this book?
This is a dead-end alley.
Don't tell your dad.
I want you to come home with me.
Only girls' shoes are sold here.
We gather here once a week.
Tom told Mary to stop worrying.
What are you getting?
Tom is passionate about his work.
"Of course, Tom loves his kids."
Why are you asking me?
Mt. Fuji is Japan's tallest mountain.
She sued him.
You're wrong about this.
I've been working here since 2013.
I like your earrings.
We should keep in touch.
Why don't you understand?
He probably won't approve your proposal.
I'm not rich enough to buy that.
Is this hat yours?
Have you been able to contact Tom?
Tom is not happy.
She died in 1960.
I can't do it alone.
You can't have your own way in everything.
It is strange that he knows nothing about the matter.
I want you to stay on the beach.
I have seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom and I'll take turns watching your kids.
They abandoned their country.
Would you like something to eat?
Go get your shoes polished.
That broken vase is my grandfather's.
Why are you crying? What's wrong?
It looks good.
"Which do you prefer, apples or bananas?"
Tom was anxious.
Read it again.
I can sing.
He works all night.
How did you get hurt?
She played a trick on my sister.
You can go to the bus station.
Don't touch anything.
What's the scale of this map?
It couldn't be Tom.
It's not Tom.
He has a daughter who is pretty.
Tom fell in the swimming pool.
I heard you enjoy going to the beach.
You flatter me.
I didn't believe him at first.
Keep out.
You're wicked.
I guess everybody thinks that I'm in love with Mary.
Tom and Mary want to talk to you.
None of this was your fault.
Tom took his own life.
I hope Tom wasn't offended.
"Tom has great wealth, but he is not happy."
Tom is definitely hiding something.
Tom doesn't want to be disappointed.
It seems to me that you're making fun of me.
It'll definitely rain.
Quit stalling.
The economic situation grew worse.
Do you still have feelings for him?
Can you stand?
No one cares about me.
This Sunday is Mother's Day in Spain.
Tom really is a nice guy!
You should set a good example to your children.
How long does it take to get there from here?
Tom told Mary to be careful.
That's a very good suggestion.
They were both naked.
I'm on the list.
She is a sorceress.
We can't choose who our parents are.
Tom is someone who can't be trusted.
We do love it.
Why do you look so worn out?
That's how he likes it.

I am almost 40 years old and I am still single.
You need friends.
I'm the new teacher.

Tom wore a dark sweater.
What newspaper do you read?

He is fond of this kind of music.
The picture is in black and white.
I'm really bad at doing stuff like this.
He drinks himself unconscious every night.
He's never been better.
Tom quit running.
I held my breath and waited.
The old man is wise and knows many things about life.
"In the morning, I write in the park."
It's upstairs.
The milk has gone bad.
Would you mind telling me who you're waiting for?
She made a new dress for her daughter.
The man regained the use of his left arm.
We must vacate the house before next month.
I couldn't make out what he wanted to say.
Do you think it'll be that easy?
The coat I want to buy costs $300.
Your attitude towards women is offensive.
You can't put a price on a life.
I got up at six this morning.
The property was divided equally among the heirs.
I'll think about what you said.
We should've done what you advised.
It's illegal to park your car here.
How come I haven't seen you here before?
You don't seem to be very hungry.
"When I first met him, I thought he was putting on airs."
Tom has a pain in the shoulder.
He told me an interesting story.
How often do you wash your hair?
How do you take your coffee?
I hope to see you tomorrow.
I don't think you'd like it.
Learning foreign languages is boring.
Stop bad mouthing Tom.
This is not about money.
Remember to mail this letter tomorrow morning.
Tom sat down underneath a tree.
Tom walks his dog every morning.
There is no point in giving him advice.
I don't feel like watching TV.
Tom was the victim of a heinous crime.
Mary is a good girl.
Tom got killed.
Is there no other way?
We didn't even get that far.
All Tom needs is a little love and affection.
I was rereading the letters you sent to me.
I enjoy working here.
"Tom wanted to kiss Mary goodbye, but knew he shouldn't."
It's about time you got a haircut.
We drove back to the hotel.
Tom has no idea how long it will take.
I said don't worry about it.
The mouse was lured into the trap by a big piece of cheese.
You should have spoken more politely.
It rained for three days.
I need a good pair of sunglasses.
They haven't paid me anything yet.
I wonder who discovered it.
You don't seem to be yourself these days.
We are comfortable in our new house.
I've visited Boston before.
Tom was born premature.
I'd like to visit Egypt someday.
English is not easy for me.
"Tom saw it, too."
I am ashamed of my son's laziness.
Let's go somewhere warm.
It's not my style.
Tom is waiting for you.
Where will we meet?
Don't let him take pictures.
She was swimming.
They are matters which we need to discuss.
Tom tripped.
Did you tell Tom when to come?
You never told me you could speak French.
Tom said he thought that the room was too small.
Tom is a chemistry professor.
Go on home.
I'm waiting for a response from him.
Tom moved about the house as quietly as he could so as not to wake Mary and the children.
What is your ultimate goal in your life?
Please tell me which bus to take to go downtown.
This stopped Tom.
He was still in his teens when he founded a company.
Tom only cares about himself.
Tom kissed his kids goodbye.
Tom is talking to someone.
Take a look at this.
We can't fail again.
I think Tom will like that.
"If you want to be alone, I'll leave."
I couldn't have prevented this.
I'm not armed.
Tom has to take medicine every three hours.
We'll stop you.
Tom rushed upstairs.
My headache is gone.
That's just how life is.
Tom came to ask us for our help.
Where is the train?
I don't work here.
Cows provide us with milk.
"The wizened, old sorcerer took me under his wing and taught me everything he knew about magic."
Sometimes it's necessary to tell the truth.
Everyone is smiling in the picture.
Don't put your elbows on the table.
I've got a sweet tooth.
There it is!
We have to study.
"Is something wrong, Tom?"
Tom poured a glass of wine for himself.
Do you feel up to it?
Tom had no hat on.
Tom didn't even know where he was.
Bad news travels quickly.
The police have found no trace of the suspect yet.
"At first sight, it seemed larger to me."
I thought you always played football on Saturday.
This is an uphill road.
Tom still remembers you.
The palace was heavily guarded.
We have to act fast.
We're extremely disappointed.
Would you mind if I ask you a question?
This makes her angry.
He went to the United States to study medicine.
Who surrendered?
I warned him of the danger.
What are you guys up to?
I eat only when I'm hungry.
"When the police stopped him for questioning, Tom tried to make a run for it."
She gave him something cold to drink.
How much are they offering?
Tom said Mary is very tired.
You lied to me.
Would you give me your phone number?
Tom remained poor all his life.
Tom asked for some water.
Tom can't afford to buy a house.
Here we go.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please don't bother.
He undertook a great deal of work.
Tom is too young to go there by himself.
Can you cut my sandwich in half?
"If you mix blue and red, the result is purple."
When did you guys decide this?
The ball bounced high in the air.
It was worth a shot.
I own a computer.
I can't tell you how to pronounce the word.
Tom didn't think that Mary would actually carry out her threat.
We may as well begin without him.
Tom isn't old enough to go there by himself.
Tom kissed Mary while John and Alice were looking the other way.
Who made this cake?
It turned out to be a lovely day.
What are we here for?
"Tom is thirty years old. ""He's not really that old, is he?"""
Put the book back in the same place where you found it.
Tom is going to do that.
She is the person I was waiting for.
Tom was crafty.
I like her younger sister very much.
I know whose bag this is.
Tom and Mary kept their marriage a secret from almost everyone.
She accused him of being inattentive to her.
It's almost impossible.
I don't think Tom killed anybody.
The hunter shot at the bird.
Pull yourself together and stop crying.
Tom helped me write this essay.
You're afraid of him.
Tom was happy.
"Check, please."
He wiped his hands on a handkerchief.
His absence yesterday was due to his cold.
We might not need to attend the meeting on Monday.
Tom and Mary are organic farmers.
Do you still have a headache?
It's time for the news on Channel 79.
I need you to drive me to the station.
Why don't you wait till morning?
The young lady carried a child in her arm.
Tom has always been shy.
You could tell by the look on Tom's face that he was disappointed.
I'm so sorry.
Don't fail to write to me.
We have to consider the problem in the light of cultural differences.
I can't imagine what it must've been like.
Is that really important?
My mother gets up early every morning.
I'd like to go to Boston.
I've studied Japanese for five years.
Did you invite him?
You don't have to use such a harsh tone with me.
Tom blinked.
How close were you?
I go to the movies once in a while.
I'm not asking Tom.
Follow the rules.
I don't get it.
The teacher is Chinese.
He couldn't control the horse.
You should cut up your meat before you eat it.
I have to have that.
I had my money stolen somewhere.
I think we should go.
Tom is dressed a little more casually than usual.
She is good at imitating him.
Have you heard this story already?
Do you like cats?
What did you do to him?
I had jeans on.
What is it you'd like to know?
Ask for Tom.
Mary doesn't wear as much makeup as Alice.
I'm a police officer.
Do you know who you’re talking to?
Do I owe you something?
Tom hasn't done anything to be ashamed of.
I know that you're disappointed.
Is eating less meat a good idea?
This game can be played by young children.
Tom stood in front of the microphone.
Can I leave my bag here?
He doesn't eat anything other than fruit.
I've been teaching French for three years.
Do you know what's wrong with Tom?
You'll regret this.
Fill up the tank.
Do you want to see more?
Plants require CO2 to grow.
We had a heavy rain yesterday.
"In 2010, there was a shortage of H1N1 vaccine."
Thank you for being my friend.
The match ended in a draw.
Tom and Mary were walking down the path with fishing poles slung over their shoulders.
I've never forgotten Tom's birthday.
You can't just barge in here whenever you feel like it.
Aren't you going to vote today?
Would you like to walk to the station with me?
You don't belong here.
He neglected his duties.
"Why are you here, Tom?"
Swimming is not allowed in this river.
You are always complaining.
I heard it might snow.
This is the church where we got married.
I don't know how to stop it.
What do you want to do?
Tom refused to give me what I asked for.
I did not mean to disappoint her.
Most Japanese eat rice every day.
How much do you earn per week?
Can't you see a stapler somewhere around there?
I'm sorry I missed your party.
Why aren't you already on board the ship?
I never thought I would get married.
The ball rolled into the stream.
Tom's car is easily recognizable since there is a big dent in the front bumper.
All of us can speak French.
Tom is doing what he loves.
Could you please show me a camera that's cheaper than this one?
Tom seldom speaks to Mary anymore.
It will be three months before our house is completed.
We've got a lot of stuff left to do.
He accepted the job.
I've trained my dog to come when I whistle.
I hear a lot of girls wear bikinis at that beach.
These infections were caused by contaminated milk.
Tom is good at avoiding fights.
Riding a horse is really thrilling.
You don't need to worry.
Tom says that he detests war.
The sun is about to rise.
Tom kept me waiting for more than three hours.
Who do you think you are?
None of us want that.
"Tom is very rich, isn't he?"
Here's some water.
He rested and became stronger.
I like coffee better than black tea.
Nobody knows where Tom is.
I write every chance I get.
He proofread my manuscript.
"After I watched TV, I went to bed."
Have we understood each other?
I want another cup of tea.
My sister is driving me crazy.
Why not come in and wait here?
I'm not convinced at all.
You're not going in the right direction.
I think I've solved the problem.
I wonder who to invite.
I just find it hard to believe that Tom really believes that.
I explained the procedure to him.
Come forward.
They say that animals aren't able to hate.
I like Tom a lot.
Tom is rather eccentric.
He did what his conscience dictated.
Aren't you dressed yet?
Will you look after my children for me?
I have three dogs. One is male and the other two are female.
Tom is too young to drink.
I wanted to help Tom build his house.
I think Tom is going to win.
"Tom would have liked to attend Mary's party. Unfortunately, he had other things he had to do."
Tom ate 100% of the pie.
Tom is convinced that the earth is flat.
Tom fell into a vat of sulfuric acid.
He is always a little irritable in the morning.
I received a letter from her.
It's very interesting.
Tom was relaxed.
Our allies are weak.
I think we should do some more.
Do you want to spend the next ten years in prison?
You're joking!
You're too young to die.
It's a cargo ship.
I didn't spend all day with Tom.
We mustn't waste our energy resources.
Tom was incorrect.
This is really cute.
I'll ask you once more.
Tell her that I am sick.
The gate is open now.
"Tom is coming to the party, too."
Let's ask him.
You should stay in school.
That's irrelevant.
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.
What did you say?
"Tom and his friends walked down the street, singing a song."
I'm reading a book about languages.
My watch loses two minutes a day.
You'd better leave now.
It's an order.
The motion was carried unanimously.
Tom always eats before going to work.
The gate is too narrow for the car.
Tom got lost in the woods.
We have no choice.
I enjoy swimming.
He sold all that he owned.
Tom wanted to thank you.
"You're not going to wear that, are you?"
Don't be too sure.
Declawing cats is forbidden in the European Union.
Have you ever heard Tom play the clarinet?
They're not afraid of hard work.
Tom met Mary on his way home.
I can't take all the credit.
He lost his balance and fell down.
Step aside. You're blocking the way.
Tom is spreading butter on the bread.
She will lay the doll on her bed.
The escaped prisoners are still on the run.
We have to tell them.
You disgust me.
I am calling my brother.
I am going to put this machine to the test today.
My sister showers every morning.
I cannot praise you enough.
"Pass the sugar, please."
Public interest has fallen off a lot.
I've had no problems with my boss.
What's Tom good at?
Let's go to my place.
He has no pity for anybody.
Tom arrived early.
It was not an easy decision.
Is your name Tom?
What did Tom have?
"At your age, you ought to know better."
I don't know what I would do without you.
I prefer a cotton blouse.
He threw the banana away.
When does the bus leave?
How do you know Tom isn't happy?
You are not permitted to touch the art.
You should learn to play an instrument.
Tom and Mary were sitting on the couch together.
"If it means what I think it means, we're in trouble."
Tom made me go.
My wife wants to adopt a child.
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
I saw it from the window.
Excuse me for just one second.
I have a lot of friends to help me.
I have no intention of ever coming back here again.
He extinguished the fire.
He expressed himself clearly.
You can do that tomorrow.
I can't promise you that.
He went to Paris by car yesterday.
We don't live here.
That's not what we're about.
I'd prefer to speak to you in private.
We had to shut the window because of the mosquitoes.
Everybody's tired.
Stop correcting me.
I was looking for the right words.
I'll buy a new one.
Tom refused to believe that he was wrong.
You can't leave now.
We'll think of something else.
What's your favorite kind of fish to catch?
Do you think Tom likes me?
Tom is outside waiting for Mary.
Tom will fail.
We should get away from here as quickly as we can.
Tom wiped his glasses.
He knows the art of making friends.
"Great, isn't it?"
Am I older than you?
Why don't we just cancel the meeting?
He teaches us English.
Tom is a pretty good snowboarder.
No one was watching.
Why can't people just try to get along with each other?
I will always remember you.
I offered to lend money to her.
She looked at me with tears running down her cheeks.
She's not the kind of girl you think she is.
We heard the sound of gunshots.
We've got to fill this hole with something.
Let's suppose it's true.
What have you come here for?
Do you think Tom's behind what's happening now?
Tom is impressed.
I don't want you hanging out with Tom.
I don't blame you for doing that.
Let the fun begin!
Revenge is sweet.
Do you do that often?
We enjoy watching TV.
I'm hanging out with my friends.
It may well snow tomorrow night.
You are our only hope.
Tom is going to resign.
Tom read all the documents.
I don't like swimming very much.
My brother is a first-year student.
You're in danger of losing your savings.
Show me the way to the bus stop.
Next Tuesday is a bank holiday.
Dozens of young people attended the demonstration.
The game became exciting.
Tom has a thing for Mary.
He has a dual personality.
Cows eat grass.
Everywhere you look you can see children playing.
Tom and John were in the army together.
Tom will be denied membership.
What more do you want?
Tom looked Mary in the eyes.
Tom pushed Mary into the room and closed the door.
Are you seriously thinking about getting a divorce?
I asked Tom to do that.
Does Tom know you know?
Do you think I haven't anticipated that?
Why weren't you able to do that?
I am looking forward to Christmas.
Tom woke up the next morning feeling great.
How did you figure out this problem?
I believe you have my umbrella.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who does this dog belong to?
Do you remember my name?
Give me your watch.
Tom can't swim very well.
The mountain peak was covered with snow.
Please give me three of each kind.
I got up at 6:30.
Tom usually drives slightly over the speed limit.
"I've tried calling Tom all day, but the line is busy."
Tom is looking for his wallet.
There were no visible dangers.
"Who do you love more, your mom or your dad?"
Let me carry your suitcase.
She gets up early.
I understand what you mean.
We're studying French.
Have you fed the dog yet?
He has gone too far.
How can I upload a photo to your website?
I must learn Japanese.
I wanted to say thank you for all your help.
The protesters demanded government reform.
The concert hasn't started yet.
Were you drunk last night?
I like rice more than bread.
I think Tom is afraid of you.
I'll show you that I am right.
That's not my problem.
Tom had an accident.
We should operate immediately.
Tom caught a big one.
Get in touch with me as soon as you arrive here.
I can make sure that doesn't happen again.
This is how I made it.
You made a promise.
I hope that you will get well soon.
I have a lot of responsibilities.
Am I a bad person?
Keep an eye on the kids.
I'll stay here till you get back.
"What is it that you do, exactly?"
There are too many rules.
"You don't like me, do you?"
I'm having a problem deleting one of my files.
She was all smiles.
Tom is grotesque.
I downloaded the file that Tom uploaded.
I don't agree with you.
I think it's good.
I came here from Boston.
The skyscraper was built on a solid foundation.
I have been busy today.
Tom and Mary reminisced about the night they met all those years ago.
The meeting lasted two hours.
They knew nothing.
A high school student made this robot.
They burst into tears.
Who will look after the baby?
I'm convinced that my daughter will pass the exam.
Stop chattering and finish your work.
Tom had a skiing accident.
They deserved it.
This curry is too hot.
You said you were happy.
The light was on in the room.
He looks a bit tired.
I sent you the money you asked for.
It was cold outside.
It's just a dream.
You're such a coward.
Tom is drinking some water.
May I have another piece of cake?
I'll be happy to help you look for an apartment.
He worked very hard.
Tom likes oranges and eats three or four a week.
What's your favorite time waster?
Tom said that he thought that it would be possible to do that.
What's the fastest way to get to Boston?
Tom was always secretive.
Our teacher speaks French as well as English.
What am I going to do with you?
Tell me what happened.
Some rich guy from Boston just bought the house next to mine.
Tell Tom.
I'm late.
You look better in this dress.
I have different priorities than you do.
She didn't want to get involved.
I look forward to reading your report.
His story can't be true.
She got married at the age of 25.
I know your language.
Tom went to sleep and never woke up.
We blew up a huge rock with dynamite.
"Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for tonight's special guest!"
The civilian unrest is showing no signs of abating.
It was black.
Thousands of dead fish have been found floating in the lake.
It's a nice day to eat outside.
I'll give Tom that.
Tom is now in jail.
My friend called me a coward.
Tom never changed.
I have a full-length mirror in my bedroom.
When do you plan to start?
It's badly damaged.
Forty people were present.
My father didn't say a word during dinner.
I said get up!
Fish are cold-blooded animals.
Tom glanced away.
What have you done to your ear?
I'm tired of waiting in line.
It'll be done by the time you get here.
I need to find out where Tom was yesterday.
Those glasses suit you.
We feel bad for them.
She asked him how to get to the station.
Why are you afraid of Tom?
"Fortunately, no one was hurt."
Tom didn't want Mary to drive drunk.
He is a psychic.
Don't touch my stuff.
I do that almost every day.
Tom told me that he could afford another divorce.
Tom is unrelated.
Could you help me?
That was my first visit to Japan.
I do it every Sunday morning.
Tom doesn't know we're here.
Tom's innocent.
The temperature fell to five degrees below zero.
I'm not on the list.
Tom should've been finished writing the report by yesterday.
Double-click on the icon.
Birds of a feather flock together.
Napoleon Bonaparte was afraid of black cats.
Be careful up there.
Tom is trying to trick you.
Don't forget to turn off the light before you go to sleep.
How can I make him stop?
We've got a long day tomorrow.
Please help yourself to the cookies.
I can't find anything that I want to eat.
You must do the work even if you don't like it.
He smiled at me and got on the train.
Tom could hardly believe his ears when he heard that Mary was coming back home to stay.
"Hurry up, and you will be in time for school."
Tom put down his spoon and picked up a fork.
Tom stared at Mary suspiciously.
I saved you.
You won't be shot.
Tom and Mary both lived in Australia.
I want you to leave us alone.
I really wish I could help.
My old car is now in the junkyard.
We arrived here in the evening.
My mom always says that she will visit me soon.
She can hardly wait for the summer vacation.
Tom never thought of the future.
I gave in to temptation and began to smoke a cigarette.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
I have a large number of books on my bookshelf.
Can I turn off the TV?
I have bigger fish to fry.
It's time for your therapy.
"He paid 1,000 yen for this book."
This is totally unacceptable.
The dog is blind in one eye.
I'm very grateful to you.
You broke your promise.
The police are on their way.
Can you pay me in advance?
I appreciate all your advice.
I intend to become a lawyer.
A table has four legs.
When was the last time you had a bath?
We can begin tonight.
The fog began to lift.
Tom is going to need my help.
Tom cooks well.
That's already been discussed.
This road will lead you to the center of town.
I saw Tom on TV.
"Tom asked Mary for a date, but she turned him down."
Everybody knew Tom was in trouble.
How was Tom killed?
A whale is a mammal.
You look gorgeous.
Tom is wheezing.
Tom wants me to apologize.
"Now that he has gone, we miss him very much."
Tom is conscious now.
Could you help me out here?
No one ever tells me anything around here.
I'm going back to Boston tomorrow.
It's the house specialty.
He doesn't need to get up so early.
I stopped smoking.
Tom was unfriendly.
He was stoned.
Tom won't be ready until October.
My boss praised me for my hard work.
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
I could never hate you.
You sure can run fast.
We're Tom's family.
You're three years older than me.
Tom is objective.
He turned his attention to the picture.
Who did you vote for in the election?
I felt very sorry that I had put them to so much trouble.
Some students are not interested in Japanese history.
I'll always love you.
I know exactly where you are.
Maybe we could collaborate.
I have a ton of work to do today.
We miss you very much.
We'll definitely ask Tom to do that.
My neighbor is a kleptomaniac.
We talked in low voices so we wouldn't wake the baby.
I'd like to discuss this with your boss.
It snowed in Osaka.
I wish the rain would stop.
He asked a question about it.
"When they're happy, we're happy."
He can speak five languages.
Tom was risking losing his job by talking to his boss that way.
Have a drink with me.
Tom worked in Australia.
Will you go with us?
Did you think about it?
This is where I usually buy shoes.
There must have been some more tea in the pot.
Tom never saw her again.
I'm swamped with work.
Tom is a good listener.
What is she so unhappy about?
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
The Jacksons have invited us over for dinner tonight.
He deserved it.
I work during the night.
No one has come.
I may never see you again.
I just can't stop crying.
Here are some interesting links.
Everyone loves him.
The drains are blocked up.
You are the one.
I've made peace with my maker. I'm ready to die.
Shame on you.
I'm a Japanese teacher.
She has undertaken too much work.
She shaves her legs.
Look at that building.
Tom kept every love letter Mary ever wrote him.
Is Tom a genius?
That's the most important thing I've learned from you.
I saw her play the piano.
Tom is depressed.
She ought to have arrived by now.
I want to declutter my apartment.
Your car is being towed.
Did Tom help his mother yesterday?
They're on good terms with their neighbors.
He did nothing but cry.
I paid two thousand yen for the book.
"If you won't tell Tom, I will."
"Tom told me that he could hear something, but he wasn't sure what it was."
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
Dad is a hard worker.
Tom and his children watched in awe as the magnificent old steam train thundered past.
I thought you said Tom was dead.
I think I've forgotten something.
We were never to see her again.
These days many people use computers.
Tom finally came home.
Tom wouldn't do anything to help.
I need some sugar to make a cake.
Tom probably thought I wouldn't like doing that.
There is no point in studying if you are feeling tired.
It was eight meters long.
Tom taught Mary how to drive.
"Whatever you decide, is fine with me."
This bag is made of leather.
He gave a loud cry for help.
Thanks again for coming.
I have plenty of money with me.
You ought not to have kept her waiting on such a cold night.
Visiting hours are almost over.
His mother is taking care of him.
The soup is cold.
Tom lowered his voice.
I will telephone you later on.
I assume you know who Tom is.
"Which do you like better, rice or bread?"
This isn't French.
How did you lose it?
We're going to do that.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom is talking.
Tom pulled out a whistle and blew it.
Tom jumped back.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom looked like he always looks.
Tom knows I can't speak French very well.
Do you prefer blondes or brunettes?
"I'll sleep when I'm dead, said Tom."
I didn't like either of these books.
You should learn French.
This was the best-selling book last week.
I cannot bring myself to do such a thing.
Wasn't she your girlfriend?
Speaking in public makes me nervous.
He raised a question.
Everything is in good order.
Tom likes brunettes.
I'd just like to know if you are coming or not.
"That might have been true a long time ago, but it's not true anymore."
Tom can't wait to get started.
It isn't anywhere near as hot today as it was yesterday.
All of Tom's friends laughed at me.
I'm always on time.
But don't you think that it's a little big? asked the shopkeeper.
We enjoyed swimming.
How much longer do you think it'll take?
Tom had his chauffeur drive him to the theater.
"Tom has seen it, too."
It's likely Tom will know what to do.
This is just the beginning.
I shook my head and said no.
He knows how to use this weapon.
Don't tell Tom where you live.
Who's that boy standing at the door?
Is it true that you built this house by yourself?
We'll be home all day tomorrow.
Tom is hurt.
Tom is just like you.
Do you wear a kimono?
What's your manager's name?
Can you think of any reason why Tom would've done that?
Tom entered his password.
She was clearly satisfied with the results.
Leave this to me.
Why didn't you just do what you said you'd do?
We have a visitor.
You don't have to shout. I can hear you.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
He became famous all over the world.
I'll ring you back.
"Whatever you do, don't let go of the rope."
Languages change over time.
How much money does he have?
Tom's hair is very long.
Tom always speaks in such a low voice that I can barely understand what he says.
Tom is eating cookies.
"Instead of going to Europe, I decided to go to America."
He is not very good at mathematics.
It's bedtime.
I've never been that nervous in my entire life.
It rained for days.
I don't like people like Tom.
Did Tom make you cry?
You can't let them take my kids away from me.
Leave us.
Tom exaggerates.
How pathetic!
"Last Sunday, Mary and I went to the library together."
Tom objected to being treated like a child.
I asked Tom where Mary was.
Did you buy a house in Germany?
I love astronomy.
I was just wondering what languages you can speak.
He's not one of us.
We'll be waiting for you in the lobby.
Who is the girl in the pink dress?
Doesn't that just make you angry?
They have brown skin and black hair.
Tom pushed Mary into the room and closed the door.
This letter was full of mistakes because it had been written too hastily.
Tom has fallen for Mary's trap.
That man has a bad reputation.
Somebody must've taken your umbrella by mistake.
You may come if you like.
You must go to school.
He twisted my arm.
I got my son to repair the door.
I'm a coward when it comes to cockroaches.
I saw Tom naked.
Don't hold it upside down.
What would we do without you?
I encouraged Tom to learn French.
Sit wherever you like.
It's snowing today.
This road is too narrow for cars to pass.
You have to give me more time.
The hunter shot the fox dead.
Tom nearly got killed.
Are you guys really cousins?
The police restricted access to the road.
You have only to push this red button.
Someone left a burning cigarette on the table.
Why didn't you wake me up?
Do you really want to know what I think?
"The traveler fainted from hunger, but soon he came to."
I have always liked the mountains.
You scared Tom.
Ask her what she bought.
Isn't his name Tom?
This is one of Tom's favorite quotes.
The prominent psychologist resembles my uncle in appearance.
Tom was at home alone.
I ran into my professor at a restaurant last night.
What's with everybody?
You can always rely on me.
They cheat.
Tom is surprised.
I'm learning French.
Where are you taking Tom?
Keep the change!
You know that's a lie.
Tom has made up his mind to go to Boston to study.
Today is election day in Poland.
I am ashamed of your behavior.
Is his father alive?
How did you find us?
Now I understand.
I didn't say anything.
I'm not married.
I don't understand you at all.
Tom is busy right now.
I'm wearing a sweater because I feel cold.
Tom told the children that they could stay here in the room if they didn't make any noise.
Nobody noticed until it was too late.
Do you have any cough medicine?
Do you have a friend named Tom?
They were told to play in the nearby park.
"My name is Tom, and this is Mary."
Tom said to say hello.
What do they do here?
I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
Winter is coming.
I want to go to college.
Tom met Mary three years ago.
Tom is always trying to boss everyone around.
He entered the room after you left.
There's so much I want to say to you.
Here's one for you.
Put down the knife.
I managed to finish the book.
We know Tom didn't do it.
I heard you talking on the phone.
Don't let Tom near my kids.
I made a serious mistake.
Take care of your own affairs yourself.
Does she play the piano?
Tom had no one to turn to for help.
I hate people like you.
Go and apologize to Tom.
Will it make a difference?
He was satisfied with the result.
He is having a hard time losing weight.
I've gained five kilograms.
The house was raided by the police.
I approve of your plan.
I'm having a very delicious meal at home.
Tom didn't know Mary would be there.
That textbook is out of date.
I don't know how to put it in Japanese.
You did all you could.
I'll go get it.
You just can't ignore it.
You should eat something before you go.
Were you tired last night?
Tom made a mistake.
She hates running.
He is in the habit of reading the newspaper while eating.
Will you please wipe the dust off the table?
I don't like this camera.
Tom was correct all along.
I was involved in a traffic accident.
About 300 people were arrested.
Tom has received several job offers.
Tom broke his promise.
I like to swim in the afternoon.
Don't just stand there.
Have you seen the news?
I thought Tom was asleep.
Tom can't read French.
You are cordially invited to our fiftieth anniversary celebration.
We can't tell Tom.
I'll have two hot dogs with mustard and ketchup.
Tom knows what you did.
I knew I'd forgotten something.
Our daughter burned her finger with a match.
Did you shave yesterday?
He led a simple life.
You stay away from her.
Was it fun?
Is your daughter a student?
He's tough on crime.
It's quarter to eight now.
You didn't try hard enough.
He reached for the pistol.
Tom explained how the accident happened.
I wish you wouldn't go.
Tom certainly speaks eloquently.
It took me more time than usual to get here today.
The most incredible thing about miracles is that they happen.
Who wants a bit of cake?
Her dream has come true at last.
Science produced the atomic bomb.
Let me try it again.
I may do that.
This isn't legal.
Tom lived there for many years.
Mary is smelling the flowers.
I asked Tom to sing my favorite song.
I left the key in the room.
Why didn't you just ask?
Is all this money yours?
"I spoke to the boy, who seemed to be older than the girl."
I think that my German is really bad.
Leaf after leaf fell to the ground.
I gave the book to my friend.
Please tell me where we're going.
I have put off writing to him till today.
Please tell the others everything you've just told me.
Artificial light is produced by electricity.
They are very big apples.
I bought her a new car.
He was snoring loudly.
I'm in denial.
That man over there might be our new teacher.
This should be interesting.
Eat whatever you like.
He has a fertile imagination.
I have just finished my work.
We can see Mt. Fuji in the distance.
Would you like anything else?
You work hard.
We used the computer in order to save time.
You know what I am talking about.
Sawako wants to go to France.
Let's turn and go back now.
I do have a theory.
Please stop singing.
Have you asked the others?
I have the same dictionary as your brother has.
Let's begin at the beginning.
How do you know where to go?
I met Mary yesterday.
Could you please overlook it this time?
"Because her parents got divorced, the girl had hardly any contact with her father."
Tell me the reason why they are absent.
Sit down!
These clothes suit you.
I want to wait for Tom.
It was superb.
Wait for me in the meeting room.
Where did you see the boy?
I wish I could remember it.
We didn't know what to do.
"In those days, I made it a point to take a walk before breakfast."
He has worked in the embassy for three months.
Nobody had anything else to say.
What's your favorite castle in Japan?
The project has to be finished by the end of the week at the latest.
Are your parents in now?
I have a cough and a little fever.
It'd be better if you didn't associate with men like that.
You can't win every time.
He won a silver medal.
I constantly talk to myself.
Is that why you're here?
I thought I could do it.
Tom gently nudged Mary.
The virus is starting to mutate.
"We went to the park, and we played there."
Tom wasn't ready.
Did she mention the results of the exam?
"If you tell people what they want to hear, they'll do what you want."
Eat everything.
She bent down and picked up the coin.
I read at least one book every month.
Tom wears a different tie every day.
We were waiting for the boat for many hours.
Did you know this?
Tom refused to help Mary do her homework.
Tom was shocked to hear that Mary had died.
What do you want to do that for?
Please bring it back tomorrow.
Welcome to Japan.
I don't want anything to drink.
What time will you be ready to leave?
I could've done that by myself.
I already took the pies out of the oven.
Have you ever saved someone's life?
Tom doesn't like math.
The store was relatively empty.
I should've never walked so much in a new pair of shoes.
Don't ever come back here again.
We have waited for you the whole day.
He's smarter than them.
Thank you for coming.
Don't trust anyone here.
The prize will go to the best student.
Can you get it repaired?
Tom and I helped ourselves to something to eat.
Your outrage is completely justified.
This is the village where I was born.
I am in Tokyo today.
They washed themselves in the river.
It's rude to talk during a concert.
This mouse was killed by my cat.
Tom has been nice to everyone.
There's been no one here.
Mary showed Tom her wedding ring.
Would you mind if I came along?
I doubled over with laughter.
I know it's not easy.
The boy sleeps in the living room.
She was the first one to help him.
All my pains are nothing compared to yours.
The war affected the way the Japanese view nuclear weapons.
I am ashamed about what happened yesterday.
Are you interested in politics?
I remember the happy days we spent together.
You should apologize.
I'm concerned whether or not I can handle a big job like that.
A war is an awful thing.
We try to keep our promises.
Don't pretend what you don't feel.
I want to thank Tom.
My computer has frozen.
Tom had to go to Boston on business.
Tom likes to watch soccer.
We know what Tom wants.
Tom only wears black clothes.
Nothing can be done about it.
"Tom was glad that he'd bought a bottle of wine with a screw cap, since he couldn't find his corkscrew."
There were no more than two books on the desk.
You've run out of things to drink.
What shall I do with it?
We were wrong.
You look Japanese.
This is a support group for widows.
She's going to kill me.
Snowboarding was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Where are the women?
Thank you for helping me translate the report into French.
Tom ran all the way to the station so he wouldn't miss his train.
You're a great kisser.
I arranged for a car to meet you at the airport.
He's on his last legs.
I would like to know what you intend to do now.
The flood was the greatest disaster they had ever had.
This book is really old.
I'll never leave you alone again.
You're rude and disrespectful.
The politician proposed reforms to Congress.
Thanks for coming.
I'm allowing you to go.
He caught hold of a rope and saved himself.
Thank you for helping us solve the problem.
He has small feet.
We have so much to discuss.
Should someone call an ambulance?
What do they want from us?
Isn't that ours?
All I have is one book.
Tom is committed.
I know she is sleeping.
I feel great.
Tom got married when he was 30 years old.
Tom said something to Mary in French.
It is thirty meters in length.
He may have missed his usual bus.
Tom told me he was going to talk to Mary.
Water is important for people.
The cabinet resigned.
Would two o'clock be all right?
Tom turned scarlet.
How can I get to the police station?
He is out of the office.
Do you drink tea or coffee?
How long does it take to go to the office from your home?
You can count on him.
The washing machine is making a strange sound.
I only have one more question for you.
The marsh is knee-deep.
"They argue a lot, but for the most part they get along quite well together."
Tom rolled down the passenger side window.
Tom is fairly pretentious.
Tom speaks very good French.
Will you lend me your bicycle?
"Tom eats mostly fruits and vegetables, and only eats meat about once a week."
We have to conclude that the policy is a failure.
I thought you'd be older.
"Tom, are you in there?"
Don't make up your mind just yet.
Tom wrote a letter to Santa Claus.
That's not what Tom wants to do.
Don't leave me alone.
Tom brushed the snow off his clothes.
You have to wake up early tomorrow morning.
How far are you going?
He is a painter.
There is one thing I want to ask.
Tom brushed the snow from his coat.
Correcting is sometimes harder than writing.
I was disappointed that she was not at home.
Do you like to watch sports on television?
Tom and Mary were worried about getting caught by the police.
Tom was able to handle it.
I want to know who used to live here.
It's hard to believe.
"If you want to be slim, follow this diet."
It's clear that Tom doesn't want to talk about it.
Do you want something else?
How are you going to convince Tom?
I no longer need a loan.
He was killed by a blunt weapon.
Do you have any idea where we are?
Has anyone talked to Tom about this?
Tom scrubbed his feet.
Are you tired right now?
He is a teacher of English.
What made you want to become an anesthesiologist?
He is too short to get at the book on the shelf.
Let me buy you a drink.
Tom is dozing.
Are you sure you don't want us to go with you?
I don't want to know who kissed you.
The telephone call lasted six hours.
She bought a tea set.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tom nodded in agreement.
My father got me to wash the car.
I must make up for lost time.
Tom won't forget this.
We had a fight.
"Tom got down on his knees in front of everyone in the restaurant, pulled a diamond ring out of his pocket and proposed to Mary, to the applause of all present."
She can speak French.
I want you to stay here until I get back.
Tom never admits that he's wrong.
Tom passed a glass of milk to Mary.
I've known you for years.
I already knew that.
The story reminds me of an experience I had long ago.
He left the motor running.
I ate an orange.
Would you mind making an extra cup of coffee whenever you decide to have some?
When does the bakery open?
That can't be right.
We assumed that you were dead.
He asked me to do it.
Be nice to her.
This must not happen again.
Do you know where I can find it?
I've chipped a tooth.
Did you warn Tom?
I can't wear those clothes. They don't fit.
I find it difficult to understand French when it's spoken quickly.
My sister works as a secretary in a big multinational.
I suppose I should be flattered.
Where are your clothes?
We can do without those.
Did Tom protest?
Both Tom and Mary study French.
I only hope Tom succeeds.
How was work today?
He was holding a pen in his hand.
I'd like to find a French-speaking doctor.
I can't feel my toes.
Tom isn't planning to stay.
Nobody can do it as well as Tom can.
My tooth hurts.
How do you intend to achieve this?
"For me, there is nothing more fun to do than to talk with him."
No way!
My brother's going to kill me.
Tom isn't going to see Mary again.
Tom's funeral was three days ago.
Say hello to your friends.
I don't know when Tom and Mary met.
I'm not a magician.
What I have to tell you is very important.
Where do you think Tom is going to live?
Please think it over.
How is that different than what I just said?
I didn't think you were going to make it.
Why are you burning these pictures?
"If you ever do come to Boston, definitely give me a call."
I'm fed up with this weather.
"If he'd taken his doctor's advice, he might not have died."
Do you often talk to yourself?
Does Tom still owe you money?
Tom will help Mary tomorrow.
We're going to Boston for a week.
What'll you have to drink?
I have a job that pays well.
Tom is irritating because he always has to have the last word in any argument.
I've never been so humiliated in my entire life.
I have to send these letters.
Who else is going with us?
We're pretty busy right now.
He speaks English and French.
"The girl wanted to tell him the truth, but she couldn't."
It's his job to pull the weeds in the garden.
They are having a chat.
Tom made up his mind to go to law school.
I just hope Tom stays awake until Mary gets home.
You don't need to go at once.
Tom knows Mary can't resist chocolate ice cream.
Perhaps you are mistaken.
Tom isn't the same man he used to be.
I just want to get a little fresh air.
What is he up to now?
He was staring at her.
Is Tom retired?
Do you want something to eat?
Leave the matter to me.
What did you want to tell me?
I have two parakeets at home.
What are their motives?
We have something in common.
I hope nobody saw you doing that.
You should read between the lines.
Please don't get up.
It happened in a flash.
Clean your hands.
Did you remember to thank Tom?
We have to act now.
I want to read it.
It is a pity that he can't come.
It's not too late to do that.
That was the scariest movie I've ever seen.
My shoulders hurt.
Our success depends on whether he helps us or not.
Get off of Tom.
I hate dancing.
"You can't say no to Tom, can you?"
I already told my parents.
"Don't do that, OK?"
The baby is sleeping in the cradle.
He invented an excuse for being late.
You know what I want.
The wind is cold today.
Listen to your mother.
He was busy yesterday afternoon.
It seems she hates you.
I don't pay attention to gossip.
"I don't have a chain saw, but I know someone who does."
I'm going to rip up this piece of paper.
You've done so much for me.
I am 4 years younger than him.
I know what they are thinking.
We'll start whenever you are ready.
I'll be right there.
He has nothing to do with it.
I've got some questions for you.
Do you need our help?
I like carrots least of all.
Could I borrow your notes?
Send me the amount by money order.
Tom is worried about the boys.
Tom has a brother who is an architect.
I am very interested in music.
I didn't expect to see you at a place like this.
Tom is ready to fight.
My neighbor rejected my request to cut his tree.
Are you going to call Tom or do you want me to?
The moon is behind the clouds.
Let's walk on the beach after dinner.
I like to walk.
I felt very troubled by the news.
I'll rephrase the question.
It is too hot to work.
"You don't really believe all those stories, do you?"
Tom has strong hands.
"This is my book, not yours."
Don't walk so fast.
Can someone check this?
We had a slight accident.
His face turned pale.
You must be careful not to waste time.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
You should ask Tom first.
Are you planning to help Tom?
He ridiculed my idea.
Guess who I am.
Do you remember when Tom said that?
I'm taking a book.
Tom isn't home yet.
Didn't your mother teach you to say thank you?
We hope to improve with time.
How much cash do you have?
Stop staring at me like that.
I've done this a hundred times.
The Zugspitze is Germany's highest mountain.
Keep writing.
Tom may do that for you.
I'm freezing.
Hand it to Tom.
The handkerchiefs are in the drawer.
Tom decided to redesign his website.
My father loves to travel by plane.
I saw to it.
Always pay attention to your surroundings.
Tom wouldn't blame you.
I play tennis.
There is no need for you to stay here.
The bathtub needs to be cleaned.
I know Tom won't tell Mary.
We had a bar of gold stolen.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
Tom was promoted.
He is always a step or two ahead of the times.
His English is excellent.
Tom was very lucky.
Tom has a twin brother named John.
I'm happy to do it.
Tom handed Mary something.
I told Tom to do that.
I'm enjoying this.
We need to talk.
I live near the sea so I often go to the beach.
Tom knows how to read people.
I want you to turn off the radio.
It's up to us.
Let me call Tom.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Tom played a Spanish folk tune on his English horn at a Chinese restaurant in France.
You'll get well soon.
All you have to do is to take care of yourself.
Tom doesn't like school.
Many students bought the book.
Please remind me to phone him tomorrow.
"You know, don't you?"
I'm an eighth grader.
I don't like your coming late every day.
"Lottery tickets are a waste of money. ""Not if you win."""
"Considering what time it was, the supermarket was relatively empty."
We're hiding.
I had no choice but to accept the offer.
Let's go!
I guess I could give it a try.
I don't feel like studying French today.
How often do you edit your profile?
Do you miss me at all?
"Tom makes over $300,000 a year."
She is a leader in her field.
What's your cat's name?
Say goodbye.
Will you tell me where I am wrong?
Let's take the short cut.
All of the students at school know me.
Tom stopped.
I won't help you.
Tom seems excited.
Tom could've won if he'd wanted to.
"We all pigged out at the company Christmas party, especially on the roast beef."
I think these are yours.
I saw something strange on my way to work this morning.
I'm the only one who understands you.
Do you want to do that?
We were cooking tempura at that time.
He acted like a madman.
Put the book on the bottom shelf.
The rumor turned out to be true.
This is his.
I hate fluorescent lighting.
Maybe Tom doesn't want you to worry.
Scream as loud as you can.
I'd like to know where Tom lives.
Excuse my clumsiness.
Tom is used to the work.
That boy is a chatterbox.
He has the habit of scratching his head.
Do you think these letters are worth saving?
Tom knows it's true.
"You've lost your job, haven't you?"
Please write to me from time to time.
Tom began crying.
You're annoying.
He managed to pass his driving test even though he was a poor driver.
How often do you watch TV?
Keep your eyes on Tom. Make sure he doesn't do anything to bother other people.
Tom can speak French.
I was stuck in traffic.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
He promised me that he wouldn't tell anybody.
What's your blood type?
You shouldn't study all day long. You should go out and have some fun.
He knows how to break the law without being caught.
I hope this fine weather lasts till the weekend.
Some people believe they can become rich without having to work.
I was too excited to sleep.
He takes a bath every morning.
Tom sounded exhausted.
He lied about it.
I'm very glad that I did it.
Speak quietly.
Tom is a school janitor.
I know it sounds silly.
He came back before eight.
Has the snow already melted?
I want to watch this.
I slept a little during lunch break because I was so tired.
Choose between the two.
The milk froze and became solid.
Tom is a good worker.
I bought this for my girlfriend.
I'm in a bad mood today.
Are you telling me that you've never had a nightmare?
I love coffee.
I'm fed up with your constant complaining.
I'm repeating it to you so you'll remember.
Can he do it?
I'll know what to do.
Grab a rag and help me clean up this mess.
You know I can't.
Did you know that Tom has three children?
You're quite drunk.
"Could I have some more water, please?"
Slow down. It's not a race.
"I don't want to have to hurt you, but if you get in my way, I'll have no choice."
We always looked down on him.
He's not allowed to leave the country.
He was afraid that he might hurt her feelings.
"Tom would like to have stayed for dinner, but he had to go back to work."
What we need is a little more time.
Watch us.
Tom doesn't complain.
I don't think people use that word anymore.
I want you to leave us alone.
I told you Tom would help us out.
I'm not giving up on Tom.
Tom rarely gets angry.
Tom is much heavier than Mary.
"I could have stayed a while longer, but I was getting tired, so I decided to leave."
He will provide you with what you need.
He is the tallest person in the class.
He was weak from the loss of blood.
Where is my seat?
We will leave in an hour.
That won't happen.
He had a dream about coming naked to school.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
Where's my refund?
You can't count on their help.
You'll never guess where we've just been.
Will you be eating here or is this to go?
"Tom wants to do that, too."
Tom is going to be a father.
Why have you come here?
Let's give it a whirl.
It's unusual for it to snow this time of year.
We've had a very hard winter.
Tom is still confused.
How in the world did you find me?
Let's call it a night.
I admire your courage.
Tom rang the bell.
How long has Tom studied French?
I spent all my energy on that project.
A third is less than a half.
I'd like to talk to you.
I advise you not to keep company with Tom.
I believe you.
Tom tried to answer the question.
She is making progress with her English.
I'm not jealous.
I assume you've heard about Tom's promotion.
I have a headache.
I bought a bottle of beer at the liquor store.
Tom is smart and talented.
I don't quite agree.
Children hate annoying teachers.
You have to cope with those difficult problems.
She said that she saw a suspicious man.
There are five pencils here.
You have to stay fit.
Tom is now the star of a reality show.
How do I thank you?
"Since he could not work out the problem that way, he tried another way."
Why isn't Tom asleep?
Is this your homework?
It is written in easy English.
Can I ask why this is so important to you?
Give me one reason why I shouldn't do that.
Keep me updated.
I shook hands with Tom and left.
Tom was very popular.
This is the one I'll use.
What time is your bus?
A gentle wind is blowing.
Tom made a run for it.
Do you know why he has been absent from school?
She doesn't have as much patience as you do.
I made hotel reservations one month in advance.
She poured tea for me.
Why did you buy that expensive dictionary?
I cannot bear the pain any more.
The boys are thirsty.
Tom was punished.
I've got news for you.
I would like to ask two questions.
"When Tom entered the room, he saw a large banner that said ""Happy Birthday, Tom."""
I kissed Tom on his forehead.
I know you have somewhere else you need to be.
Did you hear it too?
Do you want me to help you find Tom?
Tom has no intention of doing what Mary told him he has to do.
He was bursting with energy.
Get out of my chair.
I'd like to go to London.
My dad gives me an allowance of $10 a week.
Do you have any idea where Tom put the keys?
He was born in Athens in 1956.
Tom seems puzzled.
I sleep six hours a day on average.
We're going the wrong way.
You are morons.
I don't like that one.
Tom wanted Mary to help him in the garden.
You must be out of your mind to say that.
There is a lot of work to do.
Have you seen my jacket?
What is the average life span in Japan?
You should call Tom.
"If I were a rich man, I would buy you a diamond ring."
Now and then she plays tennis.
Tom would still be alive if he had been more careful.
"Take your passport with you, just in case."
She helped her mother clean the house.
Tom saw Mary waiting.
Tom said he thought that house was haunted.
I want you to go with Tom.
I'm a detective.
I guess it's not true.
You'll miss me when I'm gone.
We had plenty of warning.
It began to sprinkle.
He showed us some pictures.
Those who choose not to read have no advantage over those who can't read.
I'll never forget the day when we first met.
That's what I want to understand.
I want you to sing me a song.
Tom and John aren't brothers.
You will be shocked to hear this.
Tom has been here for about three years.
We didn't find a weapon.
My grandmother likes to weave things.
Never take a blind man's arm. Let him take yours.
Black clouds announced the coming thunderstorm.
We think we are over the worst.
I only meant to scare Tom.
I missed the last train.
Tom is winning.
Did you see what she was wearing?
Tom climbed over the wall.
Tom ought to do that more often.
Tom may do whatever he likes with what I gave him.
Tom spent more than three years in prison.
Tom and Mary have broken up.
His name eludes me.
Tom buried his money somewhere in his backyard.
"Tom wants to learn boxing, but his mother thinks it's too dangerous."
We suffered a lot of damage.
Tom stood frozen.
You're on the list.
There were a great many people at the airport.
"Tom is an archaeologist, isn't he?"
I'm here for a meeting.
You have nothing to feel guilty about.
I'll be back late tonight.
It's good that you're here.
They won us over with their small-town hospitality.
Pack your gear.
He sounded disappointed.
I have no time for games.
Tom scored the first goal of the game.
He's a loose cannon.
Will this do?
I knew you'd like that.
English is not spoken here.
I am unable to agree on that point.
Tom said that he was very discouraged.
Watermelon tastes delicious on a hot day.
You remind me of my mother.
Our boat followed a school of fish.
I highly doubt that.
Tom didn't even try.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
Did I just say something stupid?
Grab as much as you need.
He didn't respond to my question.
I've been trying to get your attention.
This is Room 839.
You are very brave.
We lost sight of them over half an hour ago.
Tom spoke about the problem with Mary.
When's Tom going to get here?
"Today, I'm not going to school."
Tom said that he couldn't swim well.
You might be right.
I shouldn't drink.
Do you guys want something to eat?
What time is it by your watch?
How did she tell them?
Goodbye!
Do you think you'd like to live in Boston?
Tom lived in Japan for ten years.
Tom doesn't shave.
Are you a college student?
I think that Tom likes Mary.
Do you have one that is a little smaller?
Did you think about our offer?
It's our car.
Do as he tells you.
I think it's time for me to buy a new camera.
I need to help Tom.
Stay cool.
Tom said that he didn't have much free time.
Tom pretended everything was OK.
Tom doesn't know what he's saying.
I was completely exhausted after the hike.
Who buried the gold bars here?
Have you ever seen such a beautiful sunset?
Tom had a very important decision to make.
It is often easier to make plans than to carry them out.
Tom laid his keys on the kitchen table.
Are you asking me for something?
You should leave out these two lines.
I hugged Tom.
That's unfortunate.
You made an error.
Do you have any tape?
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
Tom eats like a bird.
She has a very pretty face.
We'll do whatever it takes.
"As soon as I can afford to buy a house, I will."
I always knew this day would come.
They took every possibility into consideration.
The driver is responsible for the safety of the passengers.
I think Tom blames himself.
Tom said that he thought he should learn how to do that.
These aren't words.
Nobody knows how long the sick man can hold on.
It's mean of you to talk that way.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train.
I'm not your errand boy.
Tom and I are like brothers.
I want a bottle of Coca-Cola.
I'd be delighted.
"All right, do it your own way, but don't blame me if you fail."
I can't make decisions by myself.
I'd love to know everything about you.
You're good.
I've been offered another job.
Tom didn't like that.
She was breathing hard.
Tom appreciated Mary's help.
Tom doesn't make many mistakes.
Thank you for trying.
I'm here.
My father has been in the hospital for two months.
It took courage to sail across the Pacific single-handed.
There are holes in the roof.
He meets his girlfriend on Saturdays.
Tom was my younger brother's roommate in college.
How badly do you want it?
The car made a turn to the left.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
Tom is just not very good at dancing.
I have to repair the refrigerator.
His mother was a school teacher.
This room has three windows.
What are your favorite books?
Tom is on the plane.
What time shall I come?
Continue to write until he tells you to stop.
Answer the question.
I must help her at any cost.
Tom picked up his toys and put them in a box.
I have a stomachache.
The highways in this country are excellent.
This is confusing.
His ideas never earned him a single penny.
Tom isn't getting one.
She is a member of the basketball club.
Don't ask me what it was.
Do you think you're smart?
I'm just kidding.
That's why you need to contact Tom.
"Correct the errors, if there are any."
What language do they speak in the United States?
Tom hasn't called the fire department yet.
Do you want to wear a kimono?
The dictionary on the desk is Tom's.
How could Tom do this to us?
These are the rules.
I know Tom helped you.
Please correct the sentence.
I explained the rules to her.
I want an explanation.
She is beginning to play the piano.
If only the rain would stop.
Tom doesn't like cheese very much.
He doesn't want kids.
He showered her with compliments.
Does anyone in your family speak French?
She has an important role in our organization.
What do you call this bird?
The two regions differ in religion and culture.
What did he look like?
No one seems to know where Tom went.
The cat ran after the rat.
There's no cause for alarm.
She put on a coat.
Are you a member of this crew?
"During the summer vacation, I made friends with many villagers."
What made you come here?
I got a temporary job at the firm.
Tom cried his eyes out.
He is blinded by love.
Stick to the subject.
Tom has a hard time breathing.
Who saw you?
We tried really hard.
Maybe you should've told Tom the truth.
There's no film in this camera.
Do you prefer a male or female doctor?
The man entered the next room.
Tom has already done a lot for us.
This cap is too small. Please show me another.
It matters.
The two poems express human suffering.
You'll do nothing of the kind.
That's why I like you.
Tom says you're a genius.
He is not old enough to vote.
He's always making a mess of things.
Please come.
Thanks for the lift.
"We can continue playing, as long as we don't make too much noise."
Tom is indignant.
He asked the man to help him.
How come I haven't seen you here before?
He controls himself admirably.
Do I have to answer that question?
I know that he was busy.
I will see them next week.
I could hardly close the suitcase.
There are some pretty flowers in the garden.
Wait until tomorrow morning.
Would you mind if I asked you some questions?
Tom and Mary seldom speak to each other in French.
They don't talk to me anymore.
That's exactly how it happened.
Tom likes coffee better than tea.
Look what Tom wrote on the wall.
Tom does want to do that.
I'm dying to see you.
The bamboo gave but did not break.
I thought I'd say hello to Tom.
Can you really predict the future?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
It's fine today.
"If he doesn't accept the job, someone else will."
We are too drunk.
"She didn't show up at the party, but nobody knows why."
I don't understand this.
"After all we had done, he was still ungrateful."
Food should be chewed before being swallowed.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
It was just an observation.
"I have 1,500 head of cattle."
"You've never been to Europe, have you?"
Do you have a better explanation?
What made her do that?
He has a good position in the bank.
"If you didn't put this here, then who did?"
Tom drank three bottles of beer.
Both of us can speak French.
A policeman came up to me.
I think I speak French very well.
Lend us a hand.
She became a great artist.
I didn't know Tom had a sense of humor.
We have faith in Tom.
She decided on the red coat.
I just picked it up.
Tom never mentioned he had a sister.
Do you find that amusing?
It was yesterday that Mary bought this skirt.
Please advise me of the cost.
We'd be happy if you could come with us.
It's hard to find good help these days.
It's the best house in town.
She was only 18 when she graduated from university.
Keep your room clean.
The rainy season has set in.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
You know what it's like.
I never thought I'd be this busy.
She's about the same age as my older sister.
I never wanted to be a fireman.
He trusted you.
Did you reserve a room at the hotel?
They don't like Tom.
You had better wait until the police come.

Many people were killed in the war.
It's very nice of you to help me.
This is the last message I ever plan to send to you.
I talked to Tom about what happened.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.

The proposal met with opposition.
Tom certainly should have kept his promise.
I'm glad that I'm not paying.
I will give her the book tomorrow.

I've been waiting for hours.
Tom and Mary have a very large house.
He was bored with his family.
She is the messenger.
I want you to make me a promise.
Why did you invite Tom to the party?
We may as well wait.
Tom is unable to do it.
Your efforts will soon pay off.
You had better make a reservation in advance.
I'm sorry I let you down.
She revealed the secret to him.
There was no one in the room besides Tom and Mary.

Thanks for coming.
Where did you get that?

Why doesn't he come back?
Can you draw me a map of your street?
You've got to take care of yourself.
"My breakfast usually consists of coffee with milk, a piece of bread and jam, a small banana, a piece of orange and some dried plums."
We made him go.
"When I was small, my father used to throw me up in the air."
Tom sort of took me under his wing.
I know neither of them.
This book is even more interesting than that.
A friend in need is a friend indeed.
Tom probably doesn't know who did that.
Tom grew a mustache.
It's bad manners to talk during a concert.

I'm afraid that won't be possible.
This is perfectly legal.
I have to buy food and drinks for the party we're giving this evening.
Tom enjoyed himself at the dance last weekend.

I told him everything.
I wonder whether Tom will be here tomorrow or not.
Tom's speech was quite interesting.
I didn't see anyone writing.
We promise you that we'll never do it again.
Let's get this over with quickly.
They are running now.
My mother is a nurse.
She does not do things like that.

It was a long time ago.
Please write about your real experience.
That's all I was planning to say to Tom.
Tom heard wolves howling.
She asked me if I knew Tom's address.
Our visitors are at the door.
I don't agree with you.
She went blind.
Are you out of your mind?
Tom told the cops everything.
It's always been that way.
The last time I saw Tom he was headed toward the beach.
How many schools are there in your city?
Yours is over there.

I don't need that.
The first step is the hardest.

I thought you'd gone home.
Tom seldom laughs.
Tom is lovable.

Tom and Mary don't have much time to talk together. Their children are always demanding their attention.
We sought to come to terms with them.
Let's leave as soon as Tom gets here.
I'd be happy to come in.
Is this drinking water?

It's too hot.
I only have toast and coffee in the morning.
I want you to take care of Tom for a little while.
I think Tom knows more than he's admitting.
Where do you want to eat?
Ask him to attend the meeting.
"Which apple would you like? ""I'd like that one."""
Tom told me I shouldn't buy that.
Tom does love you.
I can't live on my own.
I swept the driveway for you.
I'm not a monster.
Tom wanted to leave.
It's difficult to help people when they don't want your help.
We decided to stay for a few more days.
Stop shouting.
They say love is blind.
We went to the café that I told you about.
It's hot out here.

I'll be right back.
Just wrap it up.
I want to see it again.

Forget about that right now.
What would I do without Tom?
She greeted me politely.

He came back at nine o'clock.
I have everything I want.
I can see why you don't like Tom.
I can't tell you how many times I've been there.
I have to say goodbye.
Is his father a doctor?
Do you have any gum?
Do you often travel abroad?
Tell everybody.
Which hat do you want to buy?
Isn't that why you're here?
No one wants that to happen.
Tom has a wife and three daughters.
She cooks chicken the way I like.
She lost her way.
Mary bought a skirt and a blouse.
Do you want to be rich?
You asked for our help.
I can pick you up from work if you want me to.
I'm pretty sure Tom lied to Mary.
They adopted the proposal.

The man is right.
When did you get up this morning?

Tom eats like a bird.
"More than 30,000 people braved the rain and cold to attend the Canada Day parade."
Put away your toys.
Tom ate two plates of spaghetti.
I said shut up!
Tom didn't want to take any chances.
I didn't think I was going to like you this much.
No one likes to feel used or taken advantage of.
You bought us some time.
Tom was trembling.
Can you take us to the British Museum?
I don't care for flowers very much.
Have you written your report?
Tom rushed past me.
It'll make sense when you're older.
Tom suddenly disappeared.
I wish you were here with me.

I met a nice woman.
A captain controls his ship and its crew.
Tom will be a hundred years old next year.
Do you have anything to eat?

Why didn't Tom visit Boston?
Please show me the green shirt.
I think that Japanese students are very good at gathering knowledge.
Turn around.

Tom and Mary are doing fine.
What one is is more important than what one has.

Let me help you with that.

What would you do if you were in Tom's place?
Would you help Tom find his keys?
Tom knows Mary's father.
Do we have one?
It's not new.

I beg you to help me.
Come alone.

Don't forget to flush the toilet.
How much do you love Tom?
How many dolls do you have?
Are you still married to Tom?
We know it'll happen sometime in the next three days.
I wish I could stop thinking about Tom.
Her eyes were full of sadness.
I chose to wait.
Let me ask Tom if he wants to go with us.
This is too small.
Only a few people understood me.
My wife just had a baby.
Tom isn't a very good carpenter.
Tom painted that.
I need someone to understand me.
I met him while I was staying in Paris.
Where is the city hall?
I don't want to take up too much of your time.

Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
Tom and Mary are playing cops and robbers.
When was the last time you sharpened this knife?
I asked her who the man wearing the white hat was.

Have you worked the puzzle out?
I don't want a boyfriend.
Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
I am delighted to be here.
She smiled at herself in the mirror.
The cat is looking at the fish.
I'd be very glad if you came.
Please give Tom a job.
It's a shame you don't speak French.
We shouldn't have done this.
What did you wear?
He ran away when he saw the policeman.
What kind of historian are you?
"When I visited my hometown this summer, I found the city different from what it had been ten years ago."
He was staring at her.
We will keep the room warm.
He fell head over heels into the water.

His days as a politician are numbered.
"Would you like something to drink? ""A coffee, please."""
Can you take the lid off this box?

Who is Tom talking to?
Stay as long as you want to.
It is getting warmer day by day.
Tom wasn't quiet.
She has gone shopping.
Tom doesn't know Mary's phone number.
It made me a little sad.
We often fail to realize the extent to which we depend on others.
Have you ever been in Boston before?
The medicine was a brown liquid.
He took a week off.
Here is a letter for you.
I want you to go and see if it's still there.
I think it's OK.
Tom needed help.
I don't know how long it'll last.
I slammed on the brakes.
I'll be waiting outside.
Tom has to look for a job.
Sometimes I wish I had a different religion.
You didn't have to leave.
Tom almost never eats breakfast.
Do you do that often?
Tom is not a suspect anymore.
We're out of milk.
"German forces attacked British soldiers near Amiens, France."
She's much better today.
Tom is the only person Mary can trust.
I will have finished reading this book by Tuesday.
We must start immediately.
Can anyone guess what's in this box?
I slept nine hours.
Give me another couple of days to think it over.
She's a night owl.
"I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to."
Why don't you look for a job?
Tom avoided listening to sad and sentimental love songs after he and Mary had split up.
I think I'm right.
How long can you stay?
They greeted us warmly.
There's a hole in the bottom of the bucket.
I love my family.
True happiness consists of desiring little.
I paid him a visit yesterday.
Tom speaks French much better than anyone else.
Tom agreed.
You're selfish.
He's a close friend of mine.
I will come to see you next Sunday.
It was all for nothing.
I discovered a very nice place today.
Tom can drive now.
A liter of milk contains about thirty grams of protein.
It was to a great extent his own fault.
Tom likes his eggs over hard.
Have you made any New Year's resolutions?
Why would you do something like that?
Tom's friends all laughed at me.
He's a jesuit.
Can any of you tell me where Tom is?
"Get me some, too."
You seem to remember everything that happened.
We'll likely never know for sure.
He used to read a lot.
Tom was lonely.
I'm going and that's that.
I am not coming today.
The doctor gave him some drugs to relieve the pain.
Tom was struck by lightning and died.
I found Tom's secret hiding place.
One of us is wrong.
Tom didn't deny it.
Drug addiction is a cancer in modern society.
Tom seems to be waiting for somebody.
Take your pills.
I can't just turn my back on Tom.
Tom and Mary spoke quietly so they wouldn't wake the baby.
I am beginning to understand.
This book is older than that one.
She woke up.
Tom put on some clothes.
I should never have listened to you.
He entered the room on tiptoes.
I love movies.
There are three of us.
Tom has a friend whose mother is a veterinarian.
We took it for granted.
It's not your fault.
I'm from Tokyo.
She did a good job.
Go look for it.
She didn't go yesterday.
Nobody watches her.
"Judging from her appearance, she seems to be very rich."
It is warm there all the year round.
Can you spare me a few minutes?
"You're a bit early, aren't you?"
This is a little bit strange.
"There's a book, a pencil, and a sheet of paper on the table."
It's not quite as simple as that.
Her novel was translated into Japanese.
Tom broke up with me.
You have no other choice.
She smokes 20 cigarettes a day.
Tom grinned.
I went by bus as far as London.
There was a tape recorder on the table.
Try to answer as many questions as possible.
We have guests.
I wonder whether a man could live with only two hours' sleep a night.
I didn't mean to step on any toes.
I'm sure you're aware that you'll be the only one there who can't speak French.
What was Tom wearing?
You're in great danger.
Tom started crying immediately.
"Come on, Tom. Talk to me."
Does she know you?
I know that she doesn't know who I am.
That's why I told you not to go by car.
Don't worry about such a thing.
I pocketed my keys.
He can both speak and write Russian.
"If he had taken my advice then, he would be a rich man now."
I like the way you talk.
He's my best friend.
"She tried hard, but she failed."
Tom has been complaining about you.
Tom insulted Mary. That's why she's so upset.
The plane took off at exactly ten o'clock.
Tom wants to get married again.
You are free to use this room.
I looked at my dog.
He washed her dirty hands before the meal.
How many times a week do you take a bath?
I've had this for a long time.
I should learn some French.
Tom knows he has to buy time.
It looks like an apple.
I hit Tom.
Don't go in my room.
What a charming couple!
What are your strong points?
Tom scratched the back of his neck.
We are very grateful for what you did.
I'll have to think about it.
Warn Tom.
Tom knew that Mary loved John.
Many high-level officials attended the meeting.
You've done more than enough.
Tom knows what that is.
You're not fit.
He seems to be very fond of the boy.
What's your favorite national park?
"Had I known your telephone number, I would have called you."
Do you like Mozart?
There are only 28 days in February.
That's very dangerous.
I want to hear the truth.
Tom was as poor as a church mouse.
Why don't you give Tom a chance?
You are welcome here.
How did you get Tom to quit drinking?
Tom said no.
It's hard to keep up with Tom.
Delete his name from the list of the applicants.
We had lunch at a little coffee shop.
My father plays tennis every Sunday.
"Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan, is 3,776 meters high."
Will you buy something?
You can't see my house from here.
I'm looking for my cat.
What should I have done in that situation?
Where's everyone else?
Experience is important.
I'm supposed to be working this afternoon.
I thought you'd want to take a look.
I love the way you treat me.
Tom and Mary visited Northern Europe.
Why do you love Tom?
Rice is cultivated in several parts of the world.
This is an epic novel.
Mary had never worn a kimono before.
Which direction will he choose?
She is engaged to him.
What do you learn Spanish for?
She's a very nice girl.
Tom is working on another novel.
Do you have time to help us tomorrow?
Put on a robe.
I tossed and turned in bed all night.
Who told you that I wasn't well?
I want to catch the six o'clock train to New York.
It rains a lot here in the spring.
"I can't afford a new car, so I'll have to make this one do."
Let's eat lunch outside.
Tom is a responsible driver.
I've never met anyone who makes me as happy as you make me.
How much is this sofa?
You don't want to say no to Tom.
Will we be safe here?
She went off with her friends.
I'm going to study French this afternoon.
I hope you know what this is.
This won't take long.
"The politician had sticky fingers, and 5% of every contract ended in his pocket."
"Regardless what he does, he does it well."
It would be better for you not to ask him for advice.
The clock struck ten.
Tom wants to meet you.
I went swimming in the river yesterday.
"Are you with us, Tom?"
We're going to miss you.
I can't take Tom's money.
There are many possible answers to that question.
"Tom tells everyone that he can't speak French, but that's not true."
That's why you need to contact Tom.
"You like her, don't you?"
I think you sent me the wrong document.
Please call me Tom.
Let's hit the hay.
Tom isn't a happy man.
Please think about the problem.
"Give me a hand, will you?"
Don't ask them where they are going.
I was able to help her.
He translated Homer from the Greek into English.
Let me see that.
Where's the exit?
We left the movie early.
How did you people know?
Tom came racing down the stairs.
Who is the author of this story?
We're running out of time.
The farmers didn't know what to do.
Are you coming down?
"Would you like a drink? ""I've already got one."""
"I don't like carrots. ""Neither do I."""
We felt relieved when we saw a light in the distance.
This boy surpasses the rest of the class.
She knows ten times as many English words as I do.
It's very sticky.
He was eager to return to school in September.
How in the world could I ever hate Tom?
The airplane landed at Narita Airport.
Tom has a lot of valuable books.
I've changed my mind.
I'm hungry because I haven't eaten.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
How about a cup of hot coffee?
Tom knew that Mary wasn't very hungry.
What do you do when you don't have time to eat lunch?
The roof of my house is red.
I told you to leave me alone.
Thank you for coming all the way to see me.
Are you sisters?
I'm able to swim.
I like trains better than buses.
The coffee was so hot that I nearly burned my tongue.
Where is Tom going?
There is one thing I want to ask.
You've gotten better.
There's someone waiting for you outside.
I need more time to prepare.
She almost froze to death in the snow.
I know that you don't like me.
Who will do it?
"She was a strong, fast runner then."
Tom may not be able to come.
I'll have something for you soon.
How many do you need?
He ran for his life.
Tom wears a hat almost every day.
Everyone in our class passed the exam.
You have to pay for utilities.
She is engaged to a rich man.
I work on the other side of town.
I can't stop Tom.
Please change this for a blue one.
You had no reason to do that.
Tom has already killed three people.
Tom doesn't eat raw fish.
Do you want to take that?
I wish you didn't have to leave.
I meant what I said before.
He will write for hours at a time.
He asked me to open the door.
It's pitch black.
I am in the house.
You ought not to say such a thing.
I want to be a journalist.
Who is the girl in this picture?
A plane is flying above the city.
Tom has no enemies.
How long will you be staying with us?
I stopped off at Osaka on my way to Tokyo.
I'm sure Tom would love it.
Why didn't you say anything?
Heating is expensive here.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Take it home.
Drive with the utmost care.
I was hoping you'd find something.
Tom isn't smart.
Don't go out there.
I'd like to study French.
I'll be nice.
That's why I'm asking you.
"If you hurry, you can make it."
Aren't you studying French?
Tom has already gone to sleep.
Do you know where she is?
Tom is now married to John's ex-wife.
He is on the point of death.
The gate opened.
You won't find much news in today's newspaper.
You don't need to leave right now.
Tom is about the same height as you.
The reason for your failure is that you did not try hard enough.
I didn't go.
Stop being so immature.
This train stops at every station from Nakano on.
Tom looks like he wants to say something.
Are you even trying?
The final game was postponed to tomorrow.
The striking workers protested their pay cut.
"I'm sorry, but I didn't understand what you said in English."
"Turn to the right, and you'll find my office."
Will you let me see you again?
"Instead of going to school, he stayed at home."
That smells good.
I like sleeping.
We didn't need to call the doctor.
Tom is taking care of it for us.
She visits us every other day.
He wouldn't permit me to swim in the river.
Let's go to Boston together.
Are you listening?
Tom watches TV with the kids every evening.
Tom didn't trust Mary as much as she trusted him.
"Tom was supposed to buy flowers for Mary, but he forgot."
Tell me where you're going.
Go back inside.
The only one who enjoys a crowded subway car is a pickpocket.
She makes careful choices when she buys clothes.
Which way is Tom's room?
I studied English when I was there.
We've got a long night ahead of us.
You should have worked harder.
I'll take two or three days off.
Someone should put that dog out of its misery.
It can be confusing at first.
I want you to go to Osaka at once.
He swims in the river.
You're very different from us.
How many miles is it to the next gas station?
"Can you weigh this, please?"
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Tom stared at Mary for a moment wondering if there was something she wasn't telling him.
Those present were all against the plan.
She bought a dictionary for her sister.
I'm very disappointed in you.
That's basically why I came.
I know what Tom did to you.
I have another job now.
Tom has decided to sell his car.
Tom seemed to be somewhat disappointed.
Those aren't my rules. They're Tom's.
I'm looking for my boots.
I never want to eat at this restaurant again.
Our car broke down on our way there.
Tom is a plumber.
I'll tell you what Tom said if you want me to.
The concert has already started.
Tom's wallet is almost empty.
I think Tom is conceited.
I want to eat pizza.
They hurried by without a glance.
What a big truck!
Beat the eggs.
Tom's wife is also a scientist.
"Besides being a great statesman, Sir Winston Churchill was a great writer."
Tom couldn't make up his mind.
I had hardly fallen asleep when the telephone rang.
Tom took out a loan in order to buy a car.
How long will this take?
I was able to answer all the questions.
Those are our books.
You should know it.
The temperature rose every day for a week.
Take command.
Is French more difficult than English?
I think it's wrong to tell a lie.
"You're not going to walk, are you?"
Mary is my stepsister.
Tom is an honest man.
What do you people do?
I already said no.
Did you bring it?
Would you mind watching my kids?
We took pride in our strength.
The contents of the letter were secret.
"I remember the words to the song, but I can't remember the melody."
I always liked that sweater.
Could you get in touch with him?
Give me your telephone number.
Tom and Mary's children like strawberries.
They all knew Tom.
I want to know why Tom isn't here.
School is over now.
I don't know anyone like that.
Tom's strong.
Give him a break!
She began doing her homework immediately after dinner.
This is very interesting.
I am married to a Polish woman.
I took all the coins out of my piggy bank because I didn't have any money and wasn't getting paid until next week.
Not everyone's like you.
"Since Tom was speaking in French, I couldn't understand what he was saying."
There's some leftover food in the fridge.
I can barely afford to buy enough food to feed my family.
Tom is the one who wants to wait.
I like to spend my holidays in Germany.
Tom and Mary have three children.
I'm adventurous.
"You made the mistake on purpose, didn't you?"
I agreed to the proposal.
I lived in this house as a child.
He had almost no formal education.
I see nothing wrong with it.
Tom's crying.
I'd like to change the way my room looks.
What kind of books do you like?
Can plants feel pain?
Isn't that enough for you?
We're playing cards.
Tom isn't retired.
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
What's she doing?
The cat seems extremely happy.
I'm still a little dizzy.
We don't study French.
We're defenseless.
What did you wear?
How many songs did Tom and Mary sing together?
She assembles computers.
Tom listened to classical music.
The old woman gave me two interesting books.
He is up to date.
I wonder whether Tom is as old as Mary.
I was in prison for three years.
This might not have anything to do with our problem.
The baby can stand but can't walk.
You're not expected to do anything we wouldn't do ourselves.
Last century they would have just thrown someone like Tom into a lunatic asylum.
Tom wanted to learn how to read.
I'm a married man.
Tom couldn't remember what they'd been talking about.
They are all very happy.
I like this color.
You can't let anyone know I said that.
Tom understands.
That happened here.
I'm sure Mom will get mad.
Tom said he'll be there.
"If you have a fever, it would be a good idea to go to the hospital right away."
We are traveling to France by air.
One hundred and sixteen people died as a result of a bomb attack in Pakistan.
He accomplishes whatever he sets out to do.
You'll be asleep by the time your father gets home.
I've got no idea how it works.
Two heads are better than one.
I can run faster than Tom.
Did you do that purposely?
I don't like his jokes.
I'm waiting for you.
I don't know much about you.
None of your business.
You will have a new brother.
Tom promised to pay me back on Monday.
We don't have that kind of money.
I pointed this out to Tom.
I asked her to send us the book.
I would like to go with you.
They always complain.
Ladies first.
I don't like this tie. Show me another one.
I thought you could help us.
She thinks that she's always right.
My father made my mother a cup of coffee just the way she likes it.
Would it be possible to change my reservation now?
Tom was arrested by an off-duty police officer.
Have you recovered from the shock?
She didn't order dinner yet.
That house is the place where I was born.
"Did you understand? ""More or less."""
"Anyway, it all worked out."
I'll do the best I can.
He was wrong in thinking that she'd come to see him.
I didn't think that was any fun.
Fry an egg for me.
I thought I understood you.
Tom treats me like a princess.
Tom is a promising young musician.
I can't believe Tom thinks I'm a good chess player.
Do you know what that means?
There's no need to explain.
Peel the potatoes and the carrots.
I don't think I like you.
You'll be with me.
I never got an answer from Tom.
That doesn't reassure me.
Why is Tom in the hospital?
I wonder whether or not Tom misses me.
You don't know where he is.
This bag is both good and inexpensive.
Tom quite often eats out.
Would you give me a cup of coffee?
My family is very proud of me.
Tom worked around the clock.
Does Tom get into the city very often?
Why don't you both come out here and look for yourselves?
They're staring at each other.
I came looking for you.
Where are you going to move?
Tom keeps a spare key hidden in his garden.
What are you going to do tonight?
It is snowing now.
Are you guys hungry?
"Tom, I want to stay with you."
Happy workers are better workers.
How can you say that you have nothing to wear? Your closet is full of clothes.
She fell in love with the new teacher.
The bell had already rung when I got to school.
I can come back another time.
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom motioned for Mary to keep quiet.
What do you suggest?
Tom probably isn't watching TV now.
Are you good at playing the piano?
He lives in a world of fantasy.
I'm convinced.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
You know what I like.
You're more beautiful now than the day I first met you.
He went to America to study American literature.
I think it's important to tell him the facts.
It is a pity you cannot come.
Help yourself to anything you like.
Tom doesn't have any cats.
"I couldn't sleep last night, so I decided to watch a horror movie."
I'm going to buy a camera for my daughter.
He's the love of my life.
Let's play chess another time.
I came for you.
She is good at imitating him.
I won't let you jump.
I'll find out for you.
I want an MP3 player!
The earth revolves on its axis once every 24 hours.
I'm not a native speaker.
Tom can't swim and Mary can't either.
I have breakfast at seven every morning.
Tom propped himself up on one elbow.
We raised quite a bit of money.
What would you like me to make you for dinner?
I'll be moving out at the end of the month.
This will pass.
They started shooting.
You can't force Tom to stay.
It was touch-and-go there for a while.
Tom said he had a friend in Boston.
Tom has raised three children.
Tom was asking for it.
Guess what happened to me.
You're welcome to give it a try.
"I asked Tom not to go there, but he went anyway."
Tom doesn't want me.
My son always gets sick when he rides a bus.
"Don't worry. He may look intimidating at first glance, but he's actually a very friendly person."
Tom's reply was evasive.
Don't you miss me?
Did Tom find it?
Come to my house this afternoon.
You have our full support.
Tom looked at me.
All the passengers got seasick during the storm.
How hot is it where you live?
Tom wasn't normal.
Do you really think this is the time?
Tom can't do this as well as I can.
I felt completely happy.
Tom has worked as a carpenter since 2013.
You're not the only one with secrets.
I heard a noise behind me.
Can't you understand French?
I believe she is a charming girl.
The heat is almost unbearable.
Tom is from Boston.
"Tom, could you keep an eye on the kids?"
They make a perfect couple.
He escaped from prison.
He had to continue his trip in secret.
I think it's time for me to turn off the TV.
What did Tom have to do with it?
My grandmother told me the story of Cinderella.
The visitor sat across from me.
Tom is a straight-A student.
I should have told you everything earlier.
Her dream is to visit Paris.
The sun shines during the day.
The bookstore is open.
I gave Tom a chance.
Tom called himself the Master of the Universe.
She told me the wrong address on purpose.
Expensive meals can't compensate for lack of sleep.
Tom is a little weird.
I worked in a post office during the summer vacation.
Tom might be Canadian.
Where did you pick up your Italian?
Isn't there something else we can do?
"I didn't go yesterday, so I have to go today."
What are we going to do with that?
I always got good grades in French.
You are an idiot to go out in this weather.
Tom went back to sleep.
Do Martians speak English?
I don't like it when my shoes get dirty.
Can you help?
Tom complained of the stench.
"Which color do you prefer, blue or green?"
He asked after you.
What makes you think I'm rich?
I came to tell you that you don't need to worry.
I'll explain everything.
I have no idea who you're talking about.
Tom got blamed even though it wasn't his fault.
It is cruel of him to say such things to her.
I look like my father.
"Whose earrings are these? ""They are Tania's."""
Did you see the solar eclipse yesterday?
The Diet will meet on Tuesday.
The judge condemned him to death.
I can't allow that to happen.
I'm not the only one who got here early.
Tom isn't a very good man.
I thought you loved me.
Tom punched her in the face.
I'm starving!
Tom is very handsome.
He is contented with his lot.
I do not like to perform in front of others.
He is something of a celebrity.
You should trust your gut instinct.
Tom grabbed his guitar and headed for the door.
The boy can count to ten.
We are breathing pure air.
Did you help Tom?
Can you open the window?
"If Tom had asked me for some money, I'd have given it to him."
This is the train for New York.
Tom peeked inside.
Is it necessary to live in a French-speaking country to become fluent in French?
You should know better than to ask a lady her age.
Dreaming costs nothing.
You should have told it to me sooner.
Would you like something to drink?
Write me.
He's your father.
Do you know whose car this is?
Tom was an assistant professor.
We know you're busy people.
"Don't worry, Mom. He isn't particular about food. He eats anything."
You're humming.
Can you push the door open?
What's the next station?
I suggest you have a talk with Tom.
Tom wasn't as surprised as I was.
Where do you have to be?
Have you ever seen a lion?
That's what I need to do.
He can't control himself.
Leave town.
You don't scare me.
"Although the sun was out, it was cold."
I have grave concerns.
Who contributed?
You're the most interesting person I've ever met.
I'm charging this amount to your bill.
There is no cure for schizophrenia.
Where's my grandfather?
The sad news took away his appetite.
Tom is shivering.
"You're in third grade, right?"
Have you ever eaten Mexican food?
I'm glad you brought this up.
"Get me the scissors, please."
Write Tom.
Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
I thought that you loved Tom.
Tom answered back.
He's a filthy liar.
You should meet Tom.
Tom needs your love.
They're unreliable.
What do you think he meant by that?
Tom is at home almost every evening.
The problem has more to do with you than with me.
Tom dialed 911.
"Let's face it, it's impossible. We're never gonna make it."
Tom vacuumed the carpet.
He fired most of his men.
I sat down and opened my notebook.
Tom didn't read any of the messages Mary sent to him.
You are rich.
We ate a whole load of apples.
"You're not going to sleep, are you?"
Maybe you should take a few days off.
Tom's parents were killed in a car accident.
Tom switched off the light.
Tom convinced Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom goes there every day.
Tom broke the awkward silence.
You're really beautiful.
Tom flipped his phone open.
Thanks for saving me.
Tom bought a used car last week.
The teams had just started to play when it began to rain.
He cannot afford it.
Tom has something hidden behind his back.
How long did it take for you to read this book?
I'd like two cans of tomatoes.
The storm blew down a tree.
Everyone looked happy.
I think you ought to forgive us.
I'd like to know why you didn't finish your homework on time.
That requires careful consideration.
Tom is a very good teacher.
Let me just do a quick Google search.
I know what you're planning to do.
I know what's at stake.
You haven't changed.
I see a boy.
Mr. Jackson gave us some homework.
It's for my personal use.
Can you cook a meal?
I'll take three of each kind.
The machine is out of order.
I'll foot the bill.
I heard that you share an apartment with Tom.
"You're a philosopher, aren't you?"
I couldn't help Tom do that.
I'm very disappointed in you.
He represented the labor union on the committee.
I'm not a marathon runner.
The question doesn't concern me.
It'll be a long day.
"Correct the mistakes, if there are any."
I can't play tennis as well as Tom.
You can't escape.
There were no taxis available.
Numerous stars were visible in the sky.
What do you think you're doing?
Do you want to talk?
"Tom didn't have any money, so he couldn't buy a ticket."
What is the area of this city?
German is not only spoken in Germany.
It was easy for him to solve the problem.
We're being watched.
I did it.
The question is what for.
My brother insisted on going there alone.
One witness was present.
I came here to make you an offer.
You don't need to leave right now.
You don't have to hide anything from me.
"Tom started working here on October 20, 2013."
"Tom is your son, not mine."
We met at two in the afternoon.
Does that float your boat?
What are you having?
I want to come home.
We work together.
This cold weather gives me goosebumps.
Tom wanted a closer look at the blueprints.
"When he saw me, he pretended to be asleep."
"What Tom said made you angry, didn't it?"
No animals are to be found on the island.
We're very flexible.
Did he go to see Mary?
Tom didn't think it would be appropriate for John to give Mary a pearl necklace.
Tom will contact you.
Everything went black.
Where did you get that?
This picture was painted by Tom.
When do I get there?
The only thing on the table that I normally wouldn't eat is that stuff on the yellow plate.
Many boys and girls were present.
He was stunned and didn't know how to answer.
Tom's wondering if any of his kids will remember that today is Father's Day.
What do you really want to do?
I don't think I'll ever see Tom again.
I have everything I wanted.
He is eating.
I generally have lunch there.
Call the doctor right away.
I asked Tom where he and Mary had first met each other.
Tom forced Mary to sign the contract.
We're doing what we want to do.
Why did you buy a car?
I don't want to sue Tom.
Let's just agree to disagree.
I bought it for about twelve dollars.
I had one last hope.
Tom eventually told the truth.
How were you able to escape from prison?
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I tore a hole in my jeans when I fell off my bike.
You can't expect me to pay for everything.
Who do you have to do that with?
I'm not going to shoot you.
Tom says he thinks it's a waste of time to vote.
She lived in Hiroshima until she was ten.
I have been living here for years.
I go to bed at around ten at night.
I just picked it up.
Tom passed out.
I'm not blushing!
Tom has nothing to complain about.
Have you heard about the accident?
I haven't broken any laws.

I'm so confused.
He went to London in 1970.
The top spun perilously close to the edge of the table.
She may spill the beans.
Who told Tom that?
He talked about ending the war in Korea.
We have to do this right away.
I noticed I was being observed.
"In accepting the money, he lost the respect of the people."
"I'm coming, too."
Have you made up your mind to come with me?
Tom is not to blame.
This is the life that I chose.
That one over there's really cute.
"If he had not worked hard, he would have failed the examination."
I want Tom here.
I saw something white in the park.
They appointed him as a director.
We thought the enemy had captured you.
That was the worst kept secret in Washington.
Has Tom ever kissed you?
Is this umbrella yours?
Throw it there.
Did you yell at Tom?
Are you all right?
Tom made friends with Mary.
Tom yelled.
We don't need you.
Tom was arrested and charged with the murder.
Don't let Tom eat this.
It snowed yesterday.
Tom is much better at French than I am.
Where's the bucket?
You are strong-minded.
Tom discussed the details with Mary.
You cannot do this.
Can you please stop singing?
I know something really fun we can do tomorrow.
"Tom doesn't like Mary. However, she doesn't particularly care whether he likes her or not."
She's six years older than me.
Do whatever you like.
Have you ever been to Hawaii?
You've been very good to me.
The man slumped to the floor.
Tom is irritating because he always has to have his own way.
Please insert a coin.
Tom shut the window.
Do you want some more tea?
It isn't as easy as it sounds.
You used to love coming here.
He came back many years later.
I'm not deaf.
Tom couldn't believe what had happened.
You look like your father.
I don't think you're fat.
You are quite a man.
Tom could see Mary's disappointment.
All our demands have been met.
I freaked out.
Nature is full of mystery.
My uncle lives near the school.
I work at a bar.
"I am seventeen years old, too."
Tom lost his umbrella.
Tom said he thought that I might need to do that by myself.
The hall was filled to capacity.
They're to blame as well.
Are you guys really cousins?
It's amazingly simple.
"Hey, guys. What's up?"
I have a lot more homework than Tom does.
I hear you have friends in the CIA.
The ruins are worth visiting.
It must've cost a fortune.
Tom tried to understand.
Tom contributed.
When may I go home?
Who painted this painting?
"No matter what happens, you must not give up."
I'm not in the mood to argue.
Tom said that he'd go to Boston.
Tom grows tomatoes in his garden.
"You're a murderer! ""No, I'm not!"""
"You love this car, don't you?"
I found this book interesting.
I came for you.
I can see it in your eyes.
We've got some questions for you.
Tom is a firefighter.
My upstairs neighbors are very noisy.
Tom persuaded Mary to sell her motorcycle.
Where is my clock?
Tom died happy.
Do whatever you like.
I am unfamiliar with the customs of this country.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Did you remember to wear warm socks?
She slapped him in the face.
Keep the dog out.
All the leaves on the tree turned yellow.
A woman whose husband is dead is called a widow.
"If I were a bird, I would fly to you."
I only eat vegetables that I grow myself.
Is there anyone to look after the children?
They're going to kill me.
Why didn't you come?
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary does.
I'll never ever do that again.
"With this price, your product would not be competitive in the Japanese market."
How long have you known her?
"Even though Tom told Mary about his problem, he didn't want to listen to any advice she had on how to solve it."
"With respect to that, I agree with you."
There's more.
It's up to you.
Tom gave me a very nice Christmas present.
Could you please tell Tom that I need to see him?
Carrots are good for your eyes.
Tom hasn't been spotted yet.
"Good morning, Tom."
"After Tom's house was broken into, the police questioned his neighbors."
Tom isn't safe.
She likes painting pictures.
I can scarcely believe it.
We have been up all night.
Two bags of cement will be enough.
He fought until the end.
You'd better not stay up too late.
Precise measurements are required.
She waved goodbye to him.
You should have taken all that into consideration.
I didn't actually do that myself.
Tom is working as a software engineer.
I found this watch at the station.
Come closer to the fire if you're cold.
I just don't want you to misunderstand me.
I never really thought I'd live this long.
Do you want my help or not?
What were you doing up there?
I'd like a fork.
Everything's going to be fine.
Why did you bring it?
We've stopped it.
The boy went to bed with his socks on.
It just was not my day yesterday.
Your chicken soup is great.
What are you thinking about?
What does he intend to do?
There was an earthquake yesterday.
Tom has been playing games with Mary all afternoon.
Tom is right over there.
I'm beginning to believe it.
Tom sometimes has trouble understanding other people's motives and desires.
What's for supper?
Why are you wearing those clothes?
You seem like a nice girl.
I remember the day when the accident happened.
I will never be your friend.
Tom asked Mary how to get to her house.
"He was poor, so he couldn't go to college."
I'm going to Berlin to visit my friend.
"I don't know how, but I did it."
Tom will be very pleased.
Tom must have seen me.
Did you get home safe and sound?
I had my brother put this room in order.
I had to look after the children.
Who are you and why are you here?
My brother is a teacher.
Tom talked me into staying another night.
It's only a stone's throw away from where I was born.
Most people don't know this.
Why are you limping?
I slept all day.
Are you able to tell the difference between butter and margarine?
Tom's boss demands a lot of work.
Fast food can be addictive.
You can come.
I have just cleaned my room.
Why did you go to Boston?
Can you come with me now?
I should've put on some sunscreen.
I can't recall who said that.
Do you wear glasses?
Stop that car.
"That new song is called ""Lollipop""."
Her father was probably killed in a car accident.
Can you teach me how to fly?
Tell Tom about it.
"Tom tried to kiss Mary, but she backed away."
My French got better after I got married to a native French speaker.
No one knows the reason.
Tom didn't know Mary was there.
Where is the toothpaste?
"At forty, he does not get as angry as he used to."
Tom was wearing a ridiculous hat.
They took the subway.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
I should have brought a lunch.
Don't you come near me.
I hid it under my bed.
Tom sometimes appears on TV.
She cut the apple with a knife.
Do you do that often?
How is the weather there?
Tom is still too young to drink beer.
No passengers were killed in the accident.
We all enjoyed it.
My husband's not in town.
My parents hardly ever punished me for anything.
I have a truck.
She did not keep her promise to write to me.
He pointed out some spelling errors to her.
My father is going to kill me.
I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom comes.
It worried me that she looked pale.
This is all a big misunderstanding.
I'll get you.
I thought it was a secret.
You should've phoned me.
I'm not doing this for me.
"They fined him 5,000 yen for illegal parking."
Send it to the address I gave you.
Where did you take your boots off?
I am not kidding.
I think you're both right.
He's extremely happy.
Tom died in a train accident.
That really hurts.
Do I detect sarcasm?
Tom isn't going to see me.
You're going in the wrong direction.
Tom told Mary she was beautiful.
Did you know Tom was in there?
It is difficult to speak three languages.
Expectations were low.
Give me your keys.
This doesn't look like yours.
I think it's highly unlikely that Tom will get custody of the kids.
Tom played tennis with Mary yesterday.
Never have I seen such a thing.
"Having heard the story before, she didn't want to hear it again."
Children exhibit a low tolerance for the frustrations of learning.
They painted the window frames yellow.
Tom has finally forgiven me.
My grandfather loves to read.
Where are you going to go?
Tom couldn't afford to buy what Mary wanted.
Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
Be polite to everyone.
I asked Tom what he'd do.
Don't lose your purse.
Could you bring me something to eat?
"Are you and Tom enemies? ""No. Why would we be?"""
Why did I get a C?
That book is small.
That's not necessary.
No one will be fired.
They went whale watching.
I think Tom is up to something.
I was laughed at by him.
Is that your book?
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Make a prediction.
My birthday is in July.
Tom is violent.
"Turn to the right, and you'll find my office."
Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
He's wide awake.
You cannot tame a wolf.
Keep it on you.
I was dazzled by her beauty.
What does she have?
I'll stay there till six o'clock.
Get back to the ship.
Mix three eggs and a cup of sugar.
Tom will deny everything.
Thank you for your gift.
I want my whole family to be proud of me.
Did you get an answer from Tom?
She couldn't understand what had happened there.
The land had never been ploughed.
Nightmares are scary.
Will it be hot tomorrow?
Tom made three errors.
Please don't scream at me.
Tom also plays clarinet.
We must develop renewable energy sources.
I cannot stand this noise.
Tom is defenseless.
I don't feel hungry at all.
It took Tom three hours to tune the piano.
I walked about aimlessly on the street.
I often went fishing with him.
How did you find out?
Have you eaten dinner yet?
Have the police been notified?
Tom applauded.
You're driving like a maniac!
I didn't make that mistake again.
"You're Tom's wife, aren't you?"
I've never woken up this early.
"To make matters worse, it began snowing."
I'll wait here until he comes back.
Get lost!
This watch is waterproof.
I plan to never drink again.
I can't believe you actually said that.
There was a lot of snow.
Tom said that he thought it would be possible to do that.
Thank you for coming in.
It's been one step forward and two steps back with Tom's health lately.
My father planted this tree on the day I was born.
Tom settled back.
They must be Americans.
Tom walked out into his backyard.
Did you speak to Tom about this?
The method was too expensive to be practical.
I'm not interested in what you think.
He got well again.
Do you have a larger size?
"Hey, give me a break."
Tom didn't intend to hurt Mary.
This man is not reliable.
Whoever did it didn't want us to find out about it.
Why do you ask?
We kissed each other.
This school has no heating.
What part of Canada are you from?
You could have done it.
Have you ever heard Tom sing?
You'll lose everything.
Do you want me to open the box?
Go and ask Tom.
Stop shooting.
We're dying.
Tom is closing the store.
My mother was a dancer.
Tom made up his mind to become a newspaperman.
Forty people attended.
I came looking for you.
The school rules require students to wear school uniforms.
Don't you see Tom?
Give me something to eat.
A lot of people think that whales are fish.
Will you write your name here?
What time do you close?
I never suspected anything.
Why doesn't Tom want to go?
My daughter likes egg yolks.
I need a new car.
I said we'd get one.
She wrote a lot of poems.
I think you can do better than that.
Mary is tall.
Tom said he wanted to go to Boston.
Imagine yourself having already accomplished that.
Tom loved teaching.
"In 1860, Lincoln was elected President of the United States."
Where did you catch all those fish?
You aren't watching.
The murderer was the gardener.
Do you need a lift?
How's your little sister?
"When she heard the news, she burst into tears."
There's an exception to every rule.
Tom entered through the back door.
How long can you stand on one leg with your eyes closed?
Denying a quality education to the children of working families is as wrong as denying health care or child care to working families.
What is he up to?
Tom wants to tell you about Mary.
I missed the bus.
I don't have the money to buy a car.
We're not all like that.
She patiently waited for him.
I wonder what Tom and Mary are up to.
Tom was disappointed in Mary's performance.
I swear to you I will never do it again.
Tom gave Mary his number.
I like to lie on my back and watch the clouds drift by.
We were caught in a storm.
Did you get their letter?
I didn't know anything about his plan.
He's an author.
"I tried to give her some money, but she wouldn't take any."
We're going to Boston.
Some prisoners have escaped from the jail.
This word comes from Greek.
How many were there?
I don't want to do it anymore.
Don't say such a thing again.
I have to report this.
Tom doesn't like poker very much.
People are playing near the beach.
Could you take a photo of me?
Tom needed food.
Madeira is the name of a wine.
Let's begin.
It's totally normal.
Maybe Tom can help you.
"Mary resembles her mother in looks, but not in personality."
We can't offer you a higher salary.
He heard the dog barking.
Tom knows I want to leave as soon as possible.
There are people here who need your help.
Can we help?
"Tom was wearing a bulletproof vest, so the bullet didn't kill him."
That will do.
You are my friend.
There's no film in this camera.
Could you drive more slowly?
"If I had known your telephone number, I would have called you."
He told me everything.
I can't help you with that.
I can assure you that you are wrong.
Where did you get that hat?
We know where your family lives.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Boston.
I found nothing but a pair of scissors.
It was a terrible movie.
Yesterday he came back late.
Fossil fuels won't be available forever.
Luckily nobody got wet.
He played tennis yesterday.
We easily figured out the password.
How long have you been in town?
I'll try not to disappoint you next time.
They ate marshmallows.
"We'll leave tomorrow, weather permitting."
"Tom wanted to kiss Mary, but he didn't have the nerve to try."
Tom is driving a truck.
Tom wants one.
Why not talk it over with your teacher?
I'll give you anything that you want.
Tom ran out of gas.
You don't really care about me.
Please give me a piece of paper to write on.
His son-in-law completely recovered from his illness.
Tom didn't help the poor.
Tom and I are the ones who stole your money.
Are Mary and Alice really sisters?
They are pretty.
We can't do anything about that problem at this time.
That rule applied to everybody.
Where's the light switch?
Tell me what I want to know.
We live in peace.
I'm sorry that you can't come this evening.
He's a bit drunk.
How far is it from here to the next village?
I found your cap.
Get out!
Why don't you and Tom do it?
I'll let you know when she arrives.
The universe is endless.
Tom opened his mouth to say something.
This is a Christmas present from him.
I think you're right.
Dad's working.
I have to change the batteries in the radio.
This rarely happens.
That dress is cheap.
Are you sure there's no possibility?
I know only this.
I'm sorry I forgot to wake you up.
Just be glad Tom didn't tell Mary what you really thought of her.
He seems interested in her.
Where is the American embassy?
Tom seemed bossy.
Tom won't notice.
What kind of trouble are you in?
What good is that?
Tom blinked again.
"After I locked all the doors, I went to bed."
We're winning.
He's curious about everything.
Tom and Mary decided not to leave.
I don't know where to buy imported cheese.
Tom likes the extreme cold of Alaska.
I thought that I told you I didn't want you to do that anymore.
Does that mean you want to break up?
I married Tom.
We had to walk.
I want you to call the police.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
He can speak Japanese.
Do you know who said that?
Would you mind coming with me?
"After the fire, only ash was left."
Tom retired when he was 65.
Did you hear what Tom said?
I don't think Tom would do that on purpose.
My sister has become a good pianist.
He has very little knowledge of geography.
Tom scolded Mary for not calling to say she'd be late.
I got my bicycle repaired.
"Can you help me, please?"
This could take hours.
Tom doesn't eat meat and neither does Mary.
I'll see you a week from today.
I'll make every possible effort to meet your request.
How long has she been sick?
The ship carried hundreds of immigrants to America.
Tom deserved that.
They heard Tom.
The committee has ten members.
Tom resented the fact that Mary got the promotion instead of him.
Her house is near the park.
Many songs are about unrequited love.
Do you like Tom's tattoo?
"He seldom, if ever, goes to the barber's."
I thought as much.
Your assistance is indispensable for us.
We have to talk.
Did you brush your teeth?
What are your plans for today?
My brother caught a big fish.
I can teach you how to cook.
Truth is more important than beauty.
Five years have passed since they came to Japan.
Tom's strategy is working.
I don't really agree with that.
Do you have tuna fish?
He is the father of three children.
She's a single mother of two.
Don't fail to call me as soon as you arrive there.
You must not touch the paintings.
You should go to bed early.
You won't get away with this.
How boring!
Ask your dad to help you.
I don't believe we've been formally introduced.
Don't let me die here.
Tom knows who crashed into Mary's car.
Tom filled his glass again.
"In general, men run faster than women."
This is a serious setback.
That store doesn't close till seven.
"In most parts of Israel, snow is extremely rare."
Tom just sent me an email.
My mother made me a sweater.
I made fun of him.
It's very kind of you to say so.
"Tom, I'm talking to you."
Tom never showed.
You should be ashamed of your stupidity.
You survived.
Tom was still in the classroom when I left.
Is that my hat?
She obeys him.
"I live in Boston, too."
I doubt Tom will come.
What is the most important tool ever invented?
I came for Tom.
I've found an easier way to do that.
Why are you asking me?
Will you please hold this edge?
How much does it cost for one person?
My watch is more accurate than yours.
"You're no doubt confused, Tom."
They had nothing to eat.
Would you mind if I speak to Tom alone for a sec?
This stuff is worth its weight in gold!

He walks fast.
There's one thing I didn't mention.
I laid my new clothes on the bed.

Let's play cards instead of watching television.
He wants to pay off his loan.
Have you decided to go to Australia?
"If I had time, I would study French."
Tom is much more relaxed when Mary isn't around.
Tom knew exactly what he was doing.
This car needs washing.
Aladdin found a magic lamp.
Can I have the paper when you're finished with it?
Tom didn't take his own life.
I can keep a secret.
I don't want to make the same mistakes over again.
You're wasteful.
It's an ugly situation.
You've been a great help.
Tom is the youngest child in his family.
Tom remembered.
We were here first.
What do you intend to do with the money?
Is this fish still alive?
This tree is too young to bear fruit.
Tom and I are giving up.
It didn't even cross my mind.
Say hello to your friends.
The engineer knew every minute detail about the new model.
Is this your car?

The girl has a soft heart.
Tom is somewhere in this building.

"When I opened the refrigerator, I noticed the meat had spoiled."
Tom worked with Mary.
Happy New Year!
Who wrote this poem?
He might change his mind.
So the little boy put his hands in his pockets.
They needed money to pay for the supplies.
It seemed appropriate.
It might just be a coincidence.
Tom got hurt in an accident at work.
Don't slam the door.
We're not surprised.
They'll find her.
He grew potatoes in his garden.
Tom has arthritis.
My mother baked a cake for my birthday.
When should I pick you up tomorrow?
"Don't come late, okay?"
You must take into account the fact that he is too young.
How is the climate in your country?
She promised not to be late again.
Every seat was full.
I don't like onions.
She devoted her life to music.
"There are two zeros in the number ""2010."""
Stop yelling at me.
We're on our own.
"When your friends begin to flatter you on how young you look, it's a sure sign you're getting old."
Tell me about your ship.
Tom made Mary go.
He is not as intelligent as his older brother.
He tried to approach her using every possible means.
I am in a hurry.
Tom is sitting right next to me.
Did that accident really happen last year?
She surprised him with a kiss.
Tom understands he's no longer needed.
Losing my daughter has taken away my will to live.
It's all your fault.
That's a bad sign.
"Is there a problem here, gentlemen?"
She will give a party next week.
I can't just leave. I have to tell the boss I'm leaving.
You don't seem to be yourself these days.
"She looks young. However, she's actually over forty."
Tom is a person who would never break a promise.
Did you say your name was Tom?
Harvard University was founded in 1636.
Tom should go see a doctor.
I lost my camera the other day.
It's time to go to bed. Turn off the radio.
I'm not selling you my car.
I'm going to get your pills.
What does Tom owe you?
You're the only one who asks those kinds of questions.
Most people in the village objected to the plan.
The flight was cancelled because of the thick fog.
I'm getting the hang of this new machine.

He is fond of watching baseball games on TV.
I'll see you on Monday in Boston.
You are not Japanese.
I haven't seen you since high school.
Can you tell wolves from dogs?
Who did you give the book to?
He has learned to be patient.
Would you step aside?
This annoys me.
"Take off your socks, please."
I got up at seven this morning.
I feel itchy everywhere.
His ideas are quite different from mine.
Were you going to the railway station when I saw you?
You sound disappointed.
Parents should deal fairly with their children.
I'm full of good ideas.
Tom is disgusting.
I would never betray you.
They became professional soccer players.
You idiots are giving the school a bad name.
I've enjoyed it.
I hate to contradict you.
Would you tell me why you have refused their offer?
"I waited for Tom for three hours, but he never came."
This machine was manufactured in France.
Have you fixed the thermostat?
How about another cup of coffee?
Take whichever one you want.
We've got something for you.
Tom pretended that he didn't care that he was poor.
That's why I was absent.
Is there a garden in front of the house?
There were enough seats for all of us.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might have to stay in Boston until Monday.
Why couldn't you do that?
Maybe you and I should get something to eat.
You wouldn't understand. It's a girl thing.
Dogs can't distinguish between colors.
The girl went into the forest to look for mushrooms.
I asked Tom to stop following us.
It'll break.
Mary is my fiancée.
Tom picked up his toys.
Tom didn't trust Mary and she didn't trust him.
I promise I won't be late again.
I'd never let you kiss me.
These men are used to hard work.
She must have been very young when she wrote this poem.
Do you think Tom will like the concert?
Do you eat seaweed in your country?
Gravity stresses the human body.
Tom warned you.
Tom is usually a little irritable in the morning.
How much is a room?
I want to be notified the moment Tom arrives.
That is really good news.
I know Tom will change.
You have the advantage of a good education.
How many stops is it from here?
"Tom is a great guy. ""I couldn't agree with you more."""
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Tom was running around the streets drunk and naked.
That makes me really sad.
The sky is clear.
You've often said so yourself.
He looked around the room.
Tom has tattoos on his arms.
I don't dislike him at all.
You never had a chance.
"Can I use your phone, please?"
The company wants to employ 20 people.
There are many books on this subject.
Can you hear us?
I should've explained it better.
My grandfather takes a walk every morning.
"Yesterday was Tuesday, January 26, 2010."
Tom ratted me out.
I must get the television fixed.
They killed time playing cards.
Lightning does sometimes strike the same place twice.
Nobody had an answer.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom sounded upset.
We've lost contact.
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
Americans are frank enough to say what they think.
I don't think he'll be able to do it by himself.
Don't hesitate to ask a question if you don't understand.
He wants to go to the United States.
Tom worked hard all summer.
I'm being fired because I've been late to work a lot.
Tom played the piano.
Why is everyone so concerned about Tom?
I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
Would you like me to show you how to do that?
I don't know if this is such a good idea.
It's still snowing pretty heavily.
He's away on business.
Did you make that mistake on purpose?
"He was busy, but he took the time to show me around the city."
"We have one for you, too."
I don't get along with that guy.
Tom doesn't know who he should ask.
How did you know that Tom didn't like Mary?
Please tell me this isn't true.
How come you didn't say anything?
My father fell ill because he worked too hard.
Empty your bags.
The meeting is held annually.
I finished reading this novel in three days.
Tom sounds upset.
I've already found a volunteer.
You look like a cop.
Tom caught the ball with one hand.
Tom and Mary now live in Boston.
Tom graduated from Harvard in 2013.
I don't want you to spend money on me.
Your idea differs entirely from mine.
I thought Tom was meeting us here.
You are mistaken if you think he is wrong.
I can't see anything.
Go ahead.
Don't you want to stay here with us?
Can you do this problem?
Each student has a locker.
You should look out for potholes when driving.
"Although I was tired, I did my best."
I forgot to shave.
He complained that his age was beginning to tell on him.
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.
Isn't that what we were supposed to do?
Tom is a bundle of nerves.
Why is Tom not doing that?
They just left.
Tom is restless.
They heard a gun go off in the distance.
I need the keys.
I've got to get you out of here.
I was looking for the remote.
Don't take what Tom says at face value.
Where does Tom go from here?
I was taught something different.
She breathed in the cold air.
These shoes are made in Italy.
I don't want you to think about that anymore.
The population of this city is on the increase.
Did you really do that?
Will you tell him I called?
Can I ask what you're doing here?
They didn't kill him. They just roughed him up a bit as a warning.
All we need is a little patience.
My father is a bus driver.
Never tell a lie!
"She still hated him, even after he died."
That would leave me in a fix.
This is really shocking.
I intend to stay a whole week.
Does Tom really have a girlfriend?
Tom tipped the waitress.
"I can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, we'd have been friends."
Tom had a bad dream.
Thanks for coming over.
My brother has been sick since yesterday.
Tom is scary.
I wanted an apology.
You have a good memory.
I don't know why Tom is so busy today.
I know what you were doing.
He has blond hair.
Everything is over.
You should've known better.
I don't believe that anymore.
I guessed right in nine cases out of ten.
She is accustomed to doing her homework before dinner.
Stop gossiping.
Tom was quite upset.
Those are their books.
I was sleeping.
I don't need an SUV.
"All right, do it your own way, but don't blame me if you fail."
I hope no one saw you come in here.
Tom is always welcome here.
You have no right to go there.
You shouldn't talk back like that.
Were they being told the truth?
This is the largest temple that I've ever seen.
Do you speak Spanish?
I feel like doing something different today.
Call me later.
A child needs love.
Tom asked me if I had found the keys.
You're absolutely right.
I only want what is rightfully mine.
I've been waiting for you for hours.
It's great when you're in love.
It's driving me crazy.
Tom knew who Mary wanted to go to the dance with.
One of you is lying.
I'm going to bed early today.
The meeting was called off as there was no hope of agreement on either side.
I'm coming back home by bus.
The fact is apparent to the most casual observer.
Tom has a large closet in his bedroom.
Tom doesn't really care whether he wins or not.
They're not farmers.
Tom said he couldn't find a job.
I couldn't have said it better myself.
Everyone must protect their own family.
Most people don't enjoy this.
Mary fell in love with a handsome young man.
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
She died before I arrived there.
I hope you change your mind.
Do you think it'll be difficult to finish reading this book in a week?
"In Rio de Janeiro, 20% of the population lives in slums."
Tom asked Mary some questions that she was unable to answer.
I'm going to make you happy.
Let's see if it happens.
When do you get up?
I hope I'm wrong about you.
I'll have to tell my boss that I won't be in tomorrow.
Tom climbed the tree in our front yard.
Everyone's shocked.
Tom spent the morning painting the ceiling.
Tom is all talk and no action.
Tom is a retired Army colonel.
"Get it, and put it on the fire."
I have been on friendly terms with him for more than twenty years.
Tom got out of bed and turned on the light.
We're flabbergasted.
May I help you?
I have visited Kyoto three times.
He arrived earlier than usual.
Do you deny that you went there?
One of Serbia's allies was Russia.
It's hard to eat just one strawberry.
The new theory is too abstract for ordinary people.
She likes to run.
Can you stand up?
Do you want to go for a walk later?
I dreamed about you last night.
"Pass me the salt, would you?"
They'll know.
Don't you have any ambition?
Is that the train I have to take?
Pleased to meet you.
Would you mind if I ask you a question?
They're awake.
Tom showed us his mother's picture.
I don't have to listen to you.
The drug smuggler was arrested at the airport.
You don't scare me.
That's just not true.
You have only to watch what I do.
Tom knows her.
You should have bought a Teflon-coated pan.
I don't know what's going on around here.
I go to Boston three times a year.
They are saving their money for the purchase of a house.
It doesn't matter when you come.
Five plus three is eight.
We walked along the road.
I felt very relieved when I heard the news.
Tom never forgave me for doing that.
Don't waste your time trying to help Tom.
I do like ice cream.
I don't have the slightest idea.
Everybody knows his name.
Tom will be happy to show you the way.
I was Tom's apprentice.
This would be better than that.
Is your friend still sleeping?
You have a lot to learn about men.
Tom rubbed his sore feet.
His biographer called him a wonderful man.
I spent all day thinking about Tom.
"When I got home, I realized that one of my suitcases had disappeared."
Tom and John look like brothers.
It was very kind of you to invite me.
Does this make any sense to you?
We're going out for a meal on Friday.
What do you usually wear to work?
I'm eating lunch.
This work is difficult for us.
Tom told me he was having trouble sleeping.
I saw a town in the distance.
Tom put the food on the table and told everyone to start eating.
Guess who's coming tonight.
We expect that it will rain today.
The picture on the wall was painted by Picasso.
Nobody liked Tom.
Do you think I should go by myself?
I'll buy you a new one.
Why do you hang out with those losers?
That's where I want to live.
The soup was too hot.
I want to learn how to use my new digital camera right away.
That's exactly what we did.
That was the last time any of us ever saw Tom.
Two of the enemy ships have been destroyed.
It's 300 miles from here to Boston.
"You know Tom won't do that, don't you?"
Is this the train for London?
It nearly cost him his life.
"Having done my homework, I could finally watch television."
Can I keep one of your pictures?
You're sure taking your time.
What do you want me to do with this?
No one is asking you.
He told me that his father was a doctor.
How many days are there in a week?
It was such a shock.
This lock is beautiful.
My wallet's gone.
Tom picked a flower and smelled it.
Tom wanted to get married to Mary.
Take my car.
I deal with people like that all the time.
I wonder why Tom is doing that.
He said that he would come back here tomorrow.
The dress is made of a thin fabric.
He's wearing himself out working so much.
Tom will get over it.
These diamonds aren't real.
They're impressed.
Where did you find that dress?
I prefer traveling by train to flying.
Don't believe what she says.
Tom says he knows someone who's a good sketch artist.
Do you like facial hair on men?
What could they possibly tell us that we don't already know?
We took a family vacation to Tahiti.
They should have the right to decide for themselves.
I'm a good cook.
Which of these two do you think is better?
The price of rice went up three percent.
Something terrible has happened.
She likes blue dresses.
We are aware of the error and are working on a solution.
It seems that you're very busy today.
The United States exports wheat all over the world.
When did you get to London?
Tom and Mary decided to go to marriage counselling.
Those are too big.
He is a good swimmer.
He is still here.
I think she is very attractive.
He pushed his nose against the window.
Did you know he bought a condominium?
He was stupid enough to believe her.
I play tennis every day.
That's what's great about Tom.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
He doesn't know English.
The dog seems to have been sick.
Tom didn't ask what the rules were.
Are you spying on me?
You must learn French.
It was a divine intervention.
Go away before they see you here.
The table was covered with dust.
Have you tried it yet?
I expect Tom will win.
You're needed here in the hospital.
What were you doing when I called this morning?
The medicine decreased his pain.
He liked that.
I'll certainly do this.
Do you think that's possible?
Why don't you give me what I want to have?
Do do something this evening.
I'll be in the country two weeks.
Whose is this bag?
Give me a few.
We had nice weather yesterday.
"I've had enough, thank you."
Tom was the only man in the room.
"You don't have a key, do you?"
I'm here again.
How can banks prepare for the next recession?
It's probably haunted.
I've located Tom.
Tom's problems are nothing compared to Mary's.
Tom pulled himself together.
Stop me if you can.
It's a bad time.
Tom might be right.
We are traveling to Barcelona.
Actions are more important than words.
Tom complains constantly.
I wrote it for Tom.
Tom often goes there to play chess.
Are you a member of the baseball team?
We'll go see Tom.
It was careless of you to lose my car key.
He remained poor all his life.
Do you think we can help Tom?
We need to water the flowers.
Owls are cute.
This is a very serious issue.
"Put this jacket on, and you'll be much warmer."
I never talked to Tom.
Tom took the calendar off the wall.
Tom was stabbed to death by someone on the subway.
He's impossible to satisfy.
Don't keep all of your money in one pocket.
Make sure you stick together so no one gets lost.
Tom is lonely and unhappy.
Tom is obstinate.
Would you excuse me?
You should not rely on others.
It's my duty to protect you from danger.
The girl resembles her mother.
Tom said he can get us what we need.
She fooled him.
Here's some medicine for diarrhea.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
I'm sure of his success.
It looks good to me.
We have several options.
I was born in 1988.
Tom threw away all the old newspapers that were in the attic.
I can hardly understand what he says.
She focused on her work.
Why did they turn down your proposal?
He has a hairy chest.
You're braver than I am.
Tom failed.
How long have you been in Boston?
The mountain peak was covered with snow.
She drank a cup of coffee.
You may enter now.
He's an animal.
What are you interested in doing?
Tom is a very fast swimmer.
Tom speaks French to his grandparents.
Tom is a little over thirty.
I do it because I enjoy it.
"Mom, hurry up! Everyone's waiting."
It's very healthy.
My parents never punished me for anything I did.
I was awakened at five o'clock.
This company is indifferent to the safety of its workers.
I've seen you doing that.
Tom isn't Mary's father.
Put on some decent clothes.
At least try to come on time.
Tom rarely ever walks anywhere.
"Tom hurt his left knee during practice, so John had to play the game in his place."
I can't imagine a native speaker ever saying it that way.
I partly agree with you.
You're in great danger.
My family isn't rich.
Tom opened his eyes.
I made Tom promise not to tell Mary.
I am the leader of this team.
Don't bother taking an umbrella with you.
There are about 80 different species of mangrove trees.
Are you married?
Tom knew the risks.
Don't compare yourself with your brother because he's a better man than you.
"When she heard the news, she turned pale."
She wants to kiss him.
It's the rainy season in Japan right now.
We discussed the problem.
"Could you repeat that, please?"
It's frozen hard.
What does it say?
Tom doesn't do that anymore.
I bet Tom doesn't have any plans.
My grandmother is very forgetful of things nowadays.
"If I hadn't had your cooperation, I couldn't have finished the work in time."
She finds fault with everything and everyone.
"If you have any free time, use it and do your homework."
Tom left the house without even saying goodbye.
Tom still goes to school.
I put it back.
You must learn to be more careful.
Lay it on the table.
I was a high school student at that time.
I made these.
Please change this for a blue one.
Neither of those things happened.
Tom's here.
I don't have what I want.
Did you check this?
The man lost all hope.
Can you see without your glasses?
We'll notify Tom.
Look out! There's a car coming.
She was advised by him not to go there by herself.
You should be ashamed of your behavior.
We sat on a bench in the park.
I haven't slept well recently.
That's a great idea.
I'm glad you talked me into going.
The company had to let many of its employees go.
Tom won't be away for long.
Is your mother here?
He went out without saying goodbye to me.
This used to be a butcher shop.
He took off his clothes.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
Things don't always turn out the way we plan.
Tom knew where to go.
We have to postpone the meeting.
Were you about to say something?
I'm just stating the obvious.
He sat there and smoked a pipe.
"If you don't want to do this, you don't have to."
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.
We've dodged another bullet.
He's writing a long letter.
Look at that picture.
Tom doesn't smile so much anymore.
Do you speak Swedish?
I believe the police will ignore you.
Do you have any Japanese magazines?
I only have one friend left.
Fewer people come here every year.
He can run fast.
There's no simple solution.
I have hardly any French books.
Tom is paying.
Be careful what you say and how you say it.
I'm not well.
I will show you the picture.
I've caught a cold.
Let me go!
Tom is in lots of trouble.
He filed a complaint.
Is it getting worse?
What does Tom want us to do?
"Because of his advice, I was able to succeed."
He has few friends here except you.
Do you remember who I am?
Tom is wearing a sombrero.
The speaker's comments were highly offensive.
Why wasn't anything about that in the report?
Tell me what you did in Tokyo.
You'd better consult your doctor.
Tom is wasting time.
Could you please kiss a little bit more slowly?
She's a really nice girl.
We know where your family lives.
Do you know who Tom killed?
When was the last time you spoke with Tom?
I would never hurt Tom.
Concentrate on what you're doing.
Croatia is in the southeastern part of Europe.
"If you try very hard, you will succeed."
Tom loves doing this.
I don't know what to tell you.
Take your time. There's no rush.
Let me introduce you to him.
"As soon as he went to bed, he fell asleep."
Who is the author of this book?
You'll die out there.
Start counting.
He did not believe the election was lost.
Tom still has feelings for Mary.
At least 100 people attended.
Tom bought a bar of chocolate.
I can't change that.
"Tom is short, but he's strong."
When will your train arrive in Kyoto?
You don't look sick to me.
We meant well.
Why did you quit your job?
Tom wasn't clear.
Tom went blind.
Could you find out how to get there?
I was there yesterday.
Do you have a camera?
Would you give me a discount?
Tom twirled his mustache.
Use it or lose it.
Two girls were hanging on to Tom's arms.
I didn't expect you to be here.
I want you to look for Tom.
I've learned a lot by watching Tom.
"As Tom tried to tell you, you're not allowed in here."
I'll close the door.
She seems to be possessed by an evil spirit.
The most dangerous thing Tom ever wanted to try to do was to hold a poisonous snake.
What would you have done in my place?
I can't believe I didn't get invited.
She was still weak after her illness.
He'll return at six.
You look like a policeman.
"You're not in a hurry, are you?"
The fire had spread to the next building before the firemen came.
This dress is cheaper than yours.
The reason she killed herself is unknown.
Defeated revolutions are forgotten quickly.
Put that fire out.
My birthday was last week.
Can I help you with that?
Tom tried to control his breathing and remain calm.
The pain was excruciating.
Didn't you notice it?
Tom and Mary are about the same weight.
I'll miss you so much.
Do you know us?
You came too late.
You're sharp.
Tom is studying French.
He was awoken by the noise.
That school looks just like a prison.
Tom sat down on one of the barstools.
Tom isn't as naive as a lot of people think he is.
There are very few passengers in the train.
"At last, the day has arrived for us to act."
What else did you do there?
The man admitted having broken into the house.
We rented a truck to move our furniture.
I must have expressed myself badly.
Do as he says.
"Every time we go anywhere, something awful happens."
"Without you, my life would be meaningless."
My parents wouldn't let me do that.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
Translating this material calls for a lot of patience.
How old is your oldest son?
Good jobs are hard to find.
Don't lie to me.
"Mary caught Tom prying into her diary, trying to find out if she was seeing someone else."
Where was Tom last weekend?
I don't like to clean.
Look out! There's a truck coming!
"Hi, Tom."
Tom told me.
I'm not taking Tom's word for it.
I wonder whether Tom misses me or not.
Is this your bicycle?
Is your name on the list?
I have a toothache.
"Even after Tom had been drinking all night, he didn't find Mary attractive."
Don't say a word.
I think you've made a terrible mistake.
Can you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
It's useless to deny it.
Tom told us you were busy.
In life there are ups and downs.
It was a foolish mistake.
She killed him with a knife.
Come here. I need to tell you something.
Friends are very important.
You should've seen us dancing together.
The floor has to be scrubbed.
Tom has been a gentleman.
Tom isn't strict enough with his students.
What else did Tom eat?
I'm going to see Tom today.
Tom didn't have a chance to do anything.
I smell coffee.
He lives outside the city.
Wood burns easily.
Does this really work?
Tom folded the piece of paper into a crane.
Can you help me study?
Let's try something a little simpler.
I'm looking for Tom. Have you seen him?
I need a tissue now.
I know that Tom can't understand French.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I'm also interested in Greek mythology.
I want you to tell me everything.
I like to write songs in French.
Do what your mother said.
I'm satisfied with my salary.
They called the village New Amsterdam.
"Her brother is married, but he doesn't have children."
I'll pay you at the end of the month.
Tom called Mary an idiot.
Tom talks quickly.
Girls were not allowed to go out with boys without a chaperone.
The gas tank suddenly blew up.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
There was someone else there.
Would you like to play with us?
Everything that Tom said is true.
Don't trust anybody.
I'd be happy to sing for you.
I'm very sorry that I voted for Tom.
I'm standing in the shade.
I'm sick of French.
My battery is almost dead.
Chocolate is made from cocoa beans.
I can't afford to eat in such an expensive restaurant.
Tom got caught.
"The more people you know, the less time you have to see them."
I don't know any French songs.
Tom was sleepy.
She has been studying French for a few years.
Do you want Tom there?
There may be hope for you yet.
Please don't forget to put the letter into the mailbox.
Driving during a storm can be dangerous.
You must not depend so much on others.
He is rich enough to buy two cars.
He eats nothing but fruit.
I am bound to him by a close friendship.
The dog sniffed her luggage.
Put that knife away.
He should have been a lawyer.
When can I visit you?
Aren't you coming to the party tomorrow?
I'm just trying to buy some time.
I made a decision.
Why don't you come earlier?
We had our photo taken on the beach.
I don't think I know you.
She slapped him in the face.
You've probably forgotten about it already.
"I'm pretty good at math, but calculus is way over my head."
What's your favorite memory from childhood?
His debts were piling up.
I was really young when I met you.
Some restrictions may apply.
He is honest. That's why I like him.
I didn't know you were such a good golfer.
All of us were busy cleaning the room.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
It didn't take you long to get here.
All the answers to this question were wrong.
I'm a regular at a restaurant in this neighborhood. Let's have lunch there today.
Does it work?
I'm sorry I woke you.
The train leaves in ten minutes.
You'll be here with me.
Can you please give me something to do?
"I had a part-time job as a hotel maid, but I didn't like it very much."
She used to live in Tel Aviv.
The trees are beginning to bud.
I didn't think you would come.
What time and where could we meet?
Do you have anything to declare?
Tom will be back.
Open the bottle.
The boy is wearing glasses.
Bring me my glasses.
Tom wasn't inside.
Nobody heard Tom's screams.
Can anybody else answer?
Tom finds Mary's mother quite intimidating.
They won't find Tom there.
The Red Cross distributed food to the refugees.
Tom wants to see us again.
Tom and I have been friends for years.
We'll just do what we originally planned.
It seems that he is telling a lie.
I'd like to visit Boston at least one more time before I die.
I have life insurance.
It's too late to turn back now.
Thinking negatively can become a habit.
The picture brought back a lot of memories.
Tom has to dress up for work.
I wonder why the train is late.
Tom is John's former roommate.
I hardly ever complain about anything.
I snore.
That actually happened.
"I know that I know it, but I can't remember it."
Don't underestimate it.
Everyone loves fresh bread.
We met at two in the afternoon.
"The money I have given him amounts to $10,000."
Our team lost all of its games.
Please be sure to let me know your new address soon.
"Tom knew the truth, but he didn't let anyone know that he knew it."
I am interested in the study of insects.
It's a monster storm.
Tom is still unemployed.
I'm no saint.
Are you trying to pick a fight?
That's really not funny.
I need to be sure.
I attended the party with the intention of taking some pictures.
Did you enjoy the concert?
Tom is unmoved.
Was that a yes?
Write down your name here.
He hid behind the door.
Have you already had breakfast?
We don't have any sugar.
Let me know what I can do to help.
I had hardly fallen asleep when the telephone rang.
I hope this works.
I wasn't expecting you today.
It's a French word.
She helped him overcome his sadness.
There is a bookstore in front of my house.
Have you paid your taxes?

Yours is over there.
No one wanted to talk about it.

Prices were strictly regulated during the war.

What do you think of all this?
I'm not kidding.
There is nothing in this world that I am afraid of.
Tom is painting.
She called for help.
What was the cause of his delay?
The map is on the wall.
The computer is in the library.
Tom and I swim together three times a week.
You guys seem to be having a good time.
That would be horrible.
I was raised in an orphanage in Boston.
Tom won't succeed.
You can tell me the truth.

Read the article.
I saw your father.
We should be there by noon.
I made supper.
Do you like to study?

She came here once again.

What are you two up to?
What do you plan on doing tonight?
Are you going to help us?

Give me your phone number.
I heard that happen.
I just want to relax and listen to some music.

I don't know what Tom is planning to do.
This is what my mother gave me when I got married.
Have a nice day.
Is it to go?
Half of the apples are rotten.

Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
We probably don't have enough time to finish doing that today.
We had a pleasant evening.
Tom said Mary wouldn't be here tomorrow.
They dug a grave.
Tom raised an interesting question at our meeting.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
I'm old enough to decide for myself.
"Next time, review more carefully."

She handed him the money.
It's admirable.

I bet you're going to tell me you're too tired to help.
What time do we leave tomorrow?

I want you to help Tom.
Never tell a lie!
"Tom laughed at all of Mary's jokes, even the ones he didn't think were funny."
Tom is a faith healer.
I've got a question for you.
Even the greatest scholar can't solve that.
Light the candles.
Tom told me what you did.
May I sit next to you?
There's no chance that Tom will be here on time.
Did Tom ever hurt you?
Nobody's perfect.
I couldn't have done it without you.
Tom had plenty of opportunity to plant the bomb.
Nobody's forcing you to stay.
"It may seem like Tom has forgotten all about the matter, but deep down inside, he's still torn up about it."
You'd have done the same in my position.
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about it.
I'll study your report.
You have to call Tom.
Let's have breakfast.
Many groups of immigrants have been assimilated into American society.
Tom lived in Boston for a few years.
Tom gave me a ride to the airport.
That's exactly what I meant.
Do you have any gum?
I don't think it makes him a bad person just because he's decided he likes to eat horse meat.
"You don't snore, do you?"
Her house is near the park.
I like to invent useful things.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
I told you to never speak to me again.
Can you save this seat for me?
I want to send this postcard to Japan.
"No, thank you. I'm just looking around."
Tom doesn't like to be indebted to anyone.
We are brothers.
You're strong.
We promised.
I'm bad at making decisions.
Tom kept playing.
Tom read a book all morning.
Bring me some cold water.
The rich are not always happy.
A sniper shot the lights out.
Tom made no comment.
I told him about our school.
I try to save 10% of my wages each month.
I should've called Tom.
Thanks for helping out.
Has everyone gone crazy?
I fired Tom.
Tom is going to make mistakes.
We need all the help we can get.
Is there life on other worlds?
Tom removed the bandages from Mary's leg.
It's very satisfying.
Where did I put my glasses?
Tom texted Mary.
You missed.
I can't just let Tom kill me.
I'd like to ask a question.
I would like to express my gratitude to her.
Tom and Mary couldn't move the heavy trunk.
"When he got to the station, the train had already left."
Tom felt alone.
What's your favorite yoga pose?
Smoking is bad for you.
Tom was the first to arrive and the last to leave.
You don't want to be late.
It seems that I have lost my keys.
Tom saved Mary a seat.
Will you help us?
It seems like there's no money left.
Tom got rid of all the books.
Tom and I are students.
I love the way you laugh.
I like to read jokes.
How many carpenters do you know?
"Cut out the nonsense, will you?"
I wonder where I put my glasses.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
You were lucky.
She begged him not to go there.
He adapted himself to circumstances.
It's difficult.
Tom was lucky that he didn't get killed.
She can't stand being treated like a child.
She speaks English really well.
I am afraid I ate something bad.
I bought the book.
We'll look at that.
I knew what you were up to.
Your family is amazing.
Have you ever lost?
Tom said that he wasn't planning to do that.
Tom wants results.
Was Tom happy doing that?
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
That's enough for today.
The story was true.
You would've gotten away with it if Tom hadn't told on you.
He was cheered by the good news.
What did you eat for dinner last night?
I have no choice.
I have an idea she will come today.
"In accepting the money, he lost the respect of the people."
Tom remained skeptical.
"You know there's no way I can do that without some help, don't you?"
I don't usually eat at places like this.
I hope the new plan will work out satisfactorily.
Mary said she didn't want any of us to help Tom.
We were tired and hungry.
Tom doesn't think Mary knows how to do that.
I have a feeling you and I have an awful lot in common.
Are you saying this doesn't matter?
Are you on your way home?
Keep an eye on Tom.
Why don't you go home early today?
